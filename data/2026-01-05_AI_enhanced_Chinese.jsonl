While recent video generation models have demonstrated impressive visual quality, they remain limited in real-time interaction, long-horizon consistency, and persistent memory of dynamic scenes, hindering their evolution into practical world models. In this report, we present TeleWorld, a real-time multimodal 4D world modeling framework that unifies video generation, dynamic scene reconstruction, and long-term world memory within a closed-loop system. TeleWorld introduces a novel generation-reconstruction-guidance paradigm, where generated video streams are continuously reconstructed into a dynamic 4D spatio-temporal representation, which in turn guides subsequent generation to maintain spatial, temporal, and physical consistency. To support long-horizon generation with low latency, we employ an autoregressive diffusion-based video model enhanced with Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)--a hierarchical planning method that reduces error accumulation from frame-level to segment-level-alongside efficient Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), enabling real-time synthesis under practical computational budgets. Our approach achieves seamless integration of dynamic object modeling and static scene representation within a unified 4D framework, advancing world models toward practical, interactive, and computationally accessible systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeleWorld achieves strong performance in both static and dynamic world understanding, long-term consistency, and real-time generation efficiency, positioning it as a practical step toward interactive, memory-enabled world models for multimodal generation and embodied intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "TeleWorld\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u60014D\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210-\u91cd\u5efa-\u5f15\u5bfc\u8303\u5f0f\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e16\u754c\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6301\u4e45\u8bb0\u5fc6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210-\u91cd\u5efa-\u5f15\u5bfc\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u88ab\u8fde\u7eed\u91cd\u5efa\u4e3a\u52a8\u60014D\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u8868\u793a\u53cd\u8fc7\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u540e\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6269\u6563\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b8f\u89c2-\u5fae\u89c2\u89c4\u5212\uff08MMPL\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u84b8\u998f\uff08DMD\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "TeleWorld\u5728\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e16\u754c\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u5728\u7edf\u4e004D\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "TeleWorld\u662f\u5411\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We systematically organize these tasks into six cognitive categories: object understanding, scene understanding, spatial relationship understanding, spatiotemporal relationship understanding, spatial reasoning and spatiotemporal reasoning. Spatial4D-Bench thereby offers a structured and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the spatial cognition abilities of MLLMs, covering a broad spectrum of tasks that parallel the versatility of human spatial intelligence.

In particular, during the response stage, when timely and accurate information is important, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are primarily employed to produce water extent maps. Recently, leveraging the complementary characteristics of SAR and MSI data through a multimodal approach has emerged as a promising strategy for advancing water extent mapping using deep learning models. This approach is particularly beneficial when timely post-flood observations, acquired during or shortly after the flood peak, are limited, as it enables the use of all available imagery for more accurate post-flood water extent mapping. However, the adaptive integration of partially available MSI data into the SAR-based post-flood water extent mapping process remains underexplored. To bridge this research gap, we propose the Spatially Masked Adaptive Gated Network (SMAGNet), a multimodal deep learning model that utilizes SAR data as the primary input for post-flood water extent mapping and integrates complementary MSI data through feature fusion. In experiments on the C2S-MS Floods dataset, SMAGNet consistently outperformed other multimodal deep learning models in prediction performance across varying levels of MSI data availability. Furthermore, we found that even when MSI data were completely missing, the performance of SMAGNet remained statistically comparable to that of a U-Net model trained solely on SAR data. These findings indicate that SMAGNet enhances the model robustness to missing data as well as the applicability of multimodal deep learning in real-world flood management scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSMAGNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408SAR\u548c\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6d2a\u6c34\u6df9\u6ca1\u8303\u56f4\u5236\u56fe\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u90e8\u5206\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d2a\u6c34\u671f\u95f4\u51c6\u786e\u7ed8\u5236\u6df9\u6ca1\u8303\u56f4\u5bf9\u707e\u5bb3\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u867d\u7136SAR\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u6d2a\u6c34\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u5f71\u50cf\uff08MSI\uff09\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5236\u56fe\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0cMSI\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u878d\u5408\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u7528\u7684MSI\u6570\u636e\u5230SAR\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u5236\u56fe\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSMAGNet\uff08\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5SAR\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u6d2a\u6c34\u6df9\u6ca1\u8303\u56f4\u5236\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u4e92\u8865\u7684MSI\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406MSI\u6570\u636e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5728C2S-MS Floods\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSMAGNet\u5728\u4e0d\u540cMSI\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5373\u4f7fMSI\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\uff0cSMAGNet\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u4e0e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528SAR\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684U-Net\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "SMAGNet\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6d2a\u6c34\u7ba1\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5236\u56fe\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Here, we introduce FCMBench-V1.0 -- a large-scale financial credit multimodal benchmark for real-world applications, covering 18 core certificate types, with 4,043 privacy-compliant images and 8,446 QA samples. The FCMBench evaluation framework consists of three dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, including 3 foundational perception tasks, 4 credit-specific reasoning tasks that require decision-oriented understanding of visual evidence, and 10 real-world acquisition artifact types for robustness stress testing. To reconcile compliance with realism, we construct all samples via a closed synthesis-capture pipeline: we manually synthesize document templates with virtual content and capture scenario-aware images in-house. This design also mitigates pre-training data leakage by avoiding web-sourced or publicly released images. FCMBench can effectively discriminate performance disparities and robustness across modern vision-language models.

We argue that the system's ability to focus on individual facial areas leads to better understanding and control. To achieve this capability, we construct a new multi-attribute description dataset for arbitrarily selected face regions, providing rich region-level annotations and natural language descriptions. Further, we propose a fine-tuned vision-language model based on Qwen2.5-VL, called Focal-RegionFace for facial state analysis, which incrementally refines its focus on localized facial features through multiple progressively fine-tuning stages, resulting in interpretable age estimation, FAU and emotion detection. Experimental results show that Focal-RegionFace achieves the best performance on the new benchmark in terms of traditional and widely used metrics, as well as new proposed metrics.

Next, a third generator receives as input the generated scene radiance containing the features of each spectral band, while a fourth generator estimates the underwater light transmission. These generators work together to remove the effects of light absorption and scattering, restoring the in-air colours of seafloor based on the underwater image formation equation.

We present MorphAny3D, a training-free framework that leverages Structured Latent (SLAT) representations for high-quality 3D morphing. Our key insight is that intelligently blending source and target SLAT features within the attention mechanisms of 3D generators naturally produces plausible morphing sequences. To this end, we introduce Morphing Cross-Attention (MCA), which fuses source and target information for structural coherence, and Temporal-Fused Self-Attention (TFSA), which enhances temporal consistency by incorporating features from preceding frames. An orientation correction strategy further mitigates the pose ambiguity within the morphing steps. Extensive experiments show that our method generates state-of-the-art morphing sequences, even for challenging cross-category cases. MorphAny3D further supports advanced applications such as decoupled morphing and 3D style transfer, and can be generalized to other SLAT-based generative models.

However, in outdoor field environments, partial occlusions combined with inherent ambiguity in distinguishing clustered crops from individual viewpoints poses an immense challenge for image-based segmentation methods. To address these problems, we introduce a novel crop counting framework designed for exact enumeration via 3D instance segmentation. Our approach utilizes 2D images captured from multiple viewpoints and associates independent instance masks for neural radiance field (NeRF) view synthesis. We introduce crop visibility and mask consistency scores, which are incorporated alongside 3D information from a NeRF model. This results in an effective segmentation of crop instances in 3D and highly-accurate crop counts. Furthermore, our method eliminates the dependence on crop-specific parameter tuning. We validate our framework on three agricultural datasets consisting of cotton bolls, apples, and pears, and demonstrate consistent counting performance despite major variations in crop color, shape, and size. A comparative analysis against the state of the art highlights superior performance on crop counting tasks.

Prior studies mainly focus on the domain shift between the source and target domains, whereas the intra-domain variability remains under-explored. To address the latter, an effective strategy is to diversify the styles of the synthetic target domain data during image translation. However, previous methods typically require intra-domain variations to be pre-specified for style synthesis, which may be impractical. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based style synthesis method named IntraStyler, which can capture diverse intra-domain styles without any prior knowledge. Specifically, IntraStyler uses an exemplar image to guide the style synthesis such that the output style matches the exemplar style. To extract the style-only features, we introduce a style encoder to learn styles discriminatively based on contrastive learning. We evaluate the proposed method on the largest public dataset for cross-modality domain adaptation, CrossMoDA 2023. Our experiments show the efficacy of our method in controllable style synthesis and the benefits of diverse synthetic data for downstream segmentation.

However, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generate reasoning that lacks integration of visual information. This limits their ability to solve problems that demand accurate visual perception, such as visual puzzles. We show that visual perception is the key bottleneck in such tasks: converting images into textual descriptions significantly improves performance, yielding gains of 26.7% for Claude 3.5 and 23.6% for Claude 3.7.\n  To address this, we investigate reward-driven RL as a mechanism to unlock long visual reasoning in open-source MLLMs without requiring costly supervision.

As the diversity and complexity of data and models continue to increase, there is an urgent need for high-capacity, yet more compact VQ methods. This paper aims to reconcile this conflict by presenting a new approach called LooC, which utilizes an effective Low-dimensional codebook for Compositional vector quantization. Firstly, LooC introduces a parameter-efficient codebook by reframing the relationship between codevectors and feature vectors, significantly expanding its solution space. Instead of individually matching codevectors with feature vectors, LooC treats them as lower-dimensional compositional units within feature vectors and combines them, resulting in a more compact codebook with improved performance. Secondly, LooC incorporates a parameter-free extrapolation-by-interpolation mechanism to enhance and smooth features during the VQ process, which allows for better preservation of details and fidelity in feature approximation. The design of LooC leads to full codebook usage, effectively utilizing the compact codebook while avoiding the problem of collapse. Thirdly, LooC can serve as a plug-and-play module for existing methods for different downstream tasks based on VQ. Finally, extensive evaluations on different tasks, datasets, and architectures demonstrate that LooC outperforms existing VQ methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a significantly smaller codebook.", "AI": {"tldr": "LooC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7801\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u7801\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7801\u672c\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u4f46\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7801\u672c\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7801\u672c\uff0c\u5c06\u7801\u5411\u91cf\u89c6\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ec4\u5408\u5355\u5143\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b2. \u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5916\u63a8-\u63d2\u503c\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u6ed1\uff1b3. \u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cLooC\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709VQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u7801\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u7801\u672c\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "LooC\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ec4\u5408\u7801\u672c\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While synthetic data offers a promising solution, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often show limited generalization ability. In this work, we make a key observation that representations learned from synthetic datasets often exhibit a discrete and clustered pattern that hinders regression performance: features of high-quality images cluster around reference images, while those of low-quality images cluster based on distortion types. Our analysis reveals that this issue stems from the distribution of synthetic data rather than model architecture. Consequently, we introduce a novel framework SynDR-IQA, which reshapes synthetic data distribution to enhance BIQA generalization. Based on theoretical derivations of sample diversity and redundancy's impact on generalization error, SynDR-IQA employs two strategies: distribution-aware diverse content upsampling, which enhances visual diversity while preserving content distribution, and density-aware redundant cluster downsampling, which balances samples by reducing the density of densely clustered areas. Extensive experiments across three cross-dataset settings (synthetic-to-authentic, synthetic-to-algorithmic, and synthetic-to-synthetic) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Unlike conventional methods relying on paired supervision, we leverage CycleGAN to perform unpaired image-to-image translation, mapping abundant visible-light PCB images into the infrared domain. This generative process synthesizes high-fidelity pseudo-IR samples that preserve the structural semantics of defects while accurately simulating thermal distribution patterns. Subsequently, we construct a heterogeneous training strategy that fuses generated pseudo-IR data with limited real IR samples to train a lightweight YOLOv8 detector. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively enhances feature learning under low-data conditions. The augmented detector significantly outperforms models trained on limited real data alone and approaches the performance benchmarks of fully supervised training, proving the efficacy of pseudo-IR synthesis as a robust augmentation strategy for industrial inspection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CycleGAN\u548cYOLOv8\u89e3\u51b3PCB\u7ea2\u5916\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u5230\u7ea2\u5916\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "PCB\u7ea2\u5916\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u914d\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CycleGAN\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5c06\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u5149PCB\u56fe\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7ea2\u5916\u57df\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4f2a\u7ea2\u5916\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5f02\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f2a\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7ea2\u5916\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7YOLOv8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f2a\u7ea2\u5916\u5408\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a33\u5065\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86PCB\u7ea2\u5916\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Traditional pest management methods depend heavily on manual field inspections and the use of chemical pesticides. These approaches are often costly, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and can have a negative impact on the environment. To overcome these challenges, this study presents a lightweight framework for pest detection and pesticide recommendation, designed for low-resource devices such as smartphones and drones, making it suitable for use by small and marginal farmers.\n  The proposed framework includes two main components. The first is a Pest Detection Module that uses a compact, lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with prototypical meta-learning to accurately identify pests even when only a few training samples are available. The second is a Pesticide Recommendation Module that incorporates environmental factors like crop type and growth stage to suggest safe and eco-friendly pesticide recommendations. To train and evaluate our framework, a comprehensive pest image dataset was developed by combining multiple publicly available datasets. The final dataset contains samples with different viewing angles, pest sizes, and background conditions to ensure strong generalization.\n  Experimental results show that the proposed lightweight CNN achieves high accuracy, comparable to state-of-the-art models, while significantly reducing computational complexity.

In this study, we propose TotalFM, a radiological foundation model that efficiently learns the correspondence between 3D-CT images and linguistic expressions based on the concept of organ separation, utilizing a large-scale dataset of 140,000 series. By automating the creation of organ volume and finding-sentence pairs through segmentation techniques and Large Language Model (LLM)-based radiology report processing, and by combining self-supervised pre-training via VideoMAE with contrastive learning using volume-text pairs, we aimed to balance computational efficiency and representation capability. In zero-shot organ-wise lesion classification tasks, the proposed model achieved higher F1 scores in 83% (5/6) of organs compared to CT-CLIP and 64% (9/14) of organs compared to Merlin. These results suggest that the proposed model exhibits high generalization performance in a clinical evaluation setting using actual radiology report sentences. Furthermore, in zero-shot finding-wise lesion classification tasks, our model achieved a higher AUROC in 83% (25/30) of finding categories compared to Merlin. We also confirmed performance comparable to existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in radiology report generation tasks.

Dataset available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScienceOne-AI/S1-MMAlign", "summary": "Multimodal learning has revolutionized general domain tasks, yet its application in scientific discovery is hindered by the profound semantic gap between complex scientific imagery and sparse textual descriptions. We present S1-MMAlign, a large-scale, multi-disciplinary multimodal dataset comprising over 15.5 million high-quality image-text pairs derived from 2.5 million open-access scientific papers. Spanning disciplines from physics and biology to engineering, the dataset captures diverse visual modalities including experimental setups, heatmaps, and microscopic imagery. To address the pervasive issue of weak alignment in raw scientific captions, we introduce an AI-ready semantic enhancement pipeline that utilizes the Qwen-VL multimodal large model series to recaption images by synthesizing context from paper abstracts and citation contexts.

Existing concept erasure methods address these risks by removing sensitive concepts from pre-trained models, but most of them rely on data-intensive and computationally expensive fine-tuning, which poses a critical limitation. To overcome these challenges, inspired by the observation that the model's activations are predominantly composed of generic concepts, with only a minimal component can represent the target concept, we propose a novel training-free method (ActErase) for efficient concept erasure. Specifically, the proposed method operates by identifying activation difference regions via prompt-pair analysis, extracting target activations and dynamically replacing input activations during forward passes. Comprehensive evaluations across three critical erasure tasks (nudity, artistic style, and object removal) demonstrates that our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) erasure performance, while effectively preserving the model's overall generative capability. Our approach also exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, establishing a new plug-and-play paradigm for lightweight yet effective concept manipulation in diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faActErase\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5dee\u5f02\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u66ff\u6362\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u654f\u611f\u6982\u5ff5", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7248\u6743\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u901a\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u7ec4\u6210\u3001\u4ec5\u6781\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u8868\u793a\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5dee\u5f02\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u76ee\u6807\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e76\u5728\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u66ff\u6362\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u64e6\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u88f8\u9732\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u79fb\u9664\uff09\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u64e6\u9664\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "ActErase\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u64cd\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236"}}

Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In-depth analysis shows hallucinations arise from systematic internal state variations in visual perception, cross-modal reasoning, and language decoding.

However, a critical challenge remains largely overlooked, i.e., disentangling hard tail data samples from noisy ambiguous ones. Conventional methods often indiscriminately emphasize all low-confidence samples, leading to overfitting on noisy data. To bridge this gap, building upon Evidential Deep Learning, we propose a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware framework termed DUAL, which dynamically disentangles prediction uncertainty into Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) and Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU). Specifically, we introduce EU as an indicator of sample scarcity to guide a reweighting strategy for hard-to-learn tail samples, while leveraging AU to quantify data ambiguity, employing an adaptive label smoothing mechanism to suppress the impact of noise.

Standard approaches for dynamic object reconstruction require dense coverage in both the viewing space and the temporal dimension, typically relying on multi-view videos captured at each time step. However, such setups are only possible in constrained environments. In real-world scenarios, observations are often sparse over time and captured sparsely from diverse viewpoints (e.g., from security cameras), making dynamic reconstruction highly ill-posed. We present SV-GS, a framework that simultaneously estimates a deformation model and the object's motion over time under sparse observations. To initialize SV-GS, we leverage a rough skeleton graph and an initial static reconstruction as inputs to guide motion estimation. (Later, we show that this input requirement can be relaxed.) Our method optimizes a skeleton-driven deformation field composed of a coarse skeleton joint pose estimator and a module for fine-grained deformations. By making only the joint pose estimator time-dependent, our model enables smooth motion interpolation while preserving learned geometric details. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms existing approaches under sparse observations by up to 34% in PSNR, and achieves comparable performance to dense monocular video methods on real-world datasets despite using significantly fewer frames. Moreover, we demonstrate that the input initial static reconstruction can be replaced by a diffusion-based generative prior, making our method more practical for real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "SV-GS\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9aa8\u67b6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u5efa\u9762\u4e34\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u76d1\u63a7\u6444\u50cf\u5934\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u90fd\u662f\u7a00\u758f\u7684\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSV-GS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7c97\u7565\u9aa8\u67b6\u56fe\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u9759\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u9aa8\u67b6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u3002\u8be5\u573a\u5305\u542b\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u9aa8\u67b6\u5173\u8282\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u5173\u8282\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d2\u503c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0bPSNR\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe34%\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u5e27\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u7528\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u66ff\u4ee3\u521d\u59cb\u9759\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "SV-GS\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9aa8\u67b6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, this approach ignores other sources of conditional data, such as character sheets, background images, or arbitrary colorized frames. We propose TimeColor, a sketch-based video colorization model that supports heterogeneous, variable-count references with the use of explicit per-reference region assignment. TimeColor encodes references as additional latent frames which are concatenated temporally, permitting them to be processed concurrently in each diffusion step while keeping the model's parameter count fixed.

However, prevailing data augmentation strategies for videos remain largely perturbation-driven, often introducing uncontrolled variations that amplify non-discriminative factors, which finally weaken intra-class distributional structure and representation drift with inconsistent gains across temporal scales. To address these problems, we propose Representation-aware Mixing Augmentation (ReMA), a plug-and-play augmentation strategy that formulates mixing as a controlled replacement process to expand representations while preserving class-conditional stability. ReMA integrates two complementary mechanisms. Firstly, the Representation Alignment Mechanism (RAM) performs structured intra-class mixing under distributional alignment constraints, suppressing irrelevant intra-class drift while enhancing statistical reliability. Then, the Dynamic Selection Mechanism (DSM) generates motion-aware spatiotemporal masks to localize perturbations, guiding them away from discrimination-sensitive regions and promoting temporal coherence. By jointly controlling how and where mixing is applied, ReMA improves representation robustness without additional supervision or trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on diverse video behavior benchmarks demonstrate that ReMA consistently enhances generalization and robustness across different spatiotemporal granularities.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReMA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u9891\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6df7\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u6270\u52a8\u589e\u5f3a\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u975e\u5224\u522b\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u4e3a\u6270\u52a8\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u53d7\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u975e\u5224\u522b\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u7c7b\u5185\u5206\u5e03\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u589e\u76ca\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8868\u793a\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a(ReMA)\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u673a\u5236\uff1a1) \u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236(RAM)\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7c7b\u5185\u6df7\u5408\uff1b2) \u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236(DSM)\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a9\u7801\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u907f\u5f00\u5224\u522b\u654f\u611f\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cReMA\u80fd\u591f\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ReMA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u5c31\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing methods rely on limited information from a single image, tending to confuse the two layers when their contrasts are similar, a challenge more severe at night. To address this issue, we propose the Depth-Memory Decoupling Network (DMDNet). It employs the Depth-Aware Scanning (DAScan) to guide Mamba toward salient structures, promoting information flow along semantic coherence to construct stable states. Working in synergy with DAScan, the Depth-Synergized State-Space Model (DS-SSM) modulates the sensitivity of state activations by depth, suppressing the spread of ambiguous features that interfere with layer disentanglement.

Failing to detect tiny defects often leads to serious consequences. Existing methods face a structure-semantics trade-off: structure-oriented models (such as frequency-based filters) are noise-sensitive, while semantics-oriented models (such as CLIP-based encoders) often miss fine details. To address this, we propose HarmoniAD, a frequency-guided dual-branch framework. Features are first extracted by the CLIP image encoder, then transformed into the frequency domain, and finally decoupled into high- and low-frequency paths for complementary modeling of structure and semantics. The high-frequency branch is equipped with a fine-grained structural attention module (FSAM) to enhance textures and edges for detecting small anomalies, while the low-frequency branch uses a global structural context module (GSCM) to capture long-range dependencies and preserve semantic consistency. Together, these branches balance fine detail and global semantics.

Existing studies typically resort to decoupled pipelines for geometry estimation and appearance synthesis, often hindering unified reconstruction and causing inconsistencies. This paper introduces \\textbf{JGA-LBD}, a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and appearance into a joint latent representation and formulates the generation process as bridge diffusion. Observing that directly integrating heterogeneous input conditions (e.g., depth maps, SMPL models) leads to substantial training difficulties, we unify all conditions into the 3D Gaussian representations, which can be further compressed into a unified latent space through a shared sparse variational autoencoder (VAE). Subsequently, the specialized form of bridge diffusion enables to start with a partial observation of the target latent code and solely focuses on inferring the missing components. Finally, a dedicated decoding module extracts the complete 3D human geometric structure and renders novel views from the inferred latent representation. Experiments demonstrate that JGA-LBD outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both geometry fidelity and appearance quality, including challenging in-the-wild scenarios.

However, VTL still suffers from modality discrepancies between VIS and TAC images, as well as domain gaps caused by non-standardized tactile sensors and inconsistent data collection procedures. We formulate these challenges as a new task, termed single domain generalization for multimodal VTL (SDG-VTL). In this paper, we propose an OmniVaT framework that, for the first time, successfully addresses this task. On the one hand, OmniVaT integrates a multimodal fractional Fourier adapter (MFFA) to map VIS and TAC embeddings into a unified embedding-frequency space, thereby effectively mitigating the modality gap without multi-domain training data or careful cross-modal fusion strategies. On the other hand, it also incorporates a discrete tree generation (DTG) module that obtains diverse and reliable multimodal fractional representations through a hierarchical tree structure, thereby enhancing its adaptivity to fluctuating domain shifts in unseen domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior cross-domain generalization performance of OmniVaT on the SDG-VTL task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOmniVaT\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9-\u89e6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6570\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u6811\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9-\u89e6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2\uff09\u7531\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u9650\u5236\u4e86VTL\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOmniVaT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6570\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff08MFFA\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5d4c\u5165-\u9891\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2\uff09\u79bb\u6563\u6811\u751f\u6210\uff08DTG\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u83b7\u5f97\u591a\u6837\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5206\u6570\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eOmniVaT\u5728SDG-VTL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6216\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniVaT\u9996\u6b21\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u89e6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5355\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5d4c\u5165-\u9891\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose DVEFormer - an efficient RGB-D Transformer-based approach that predicts dense text-aligned visual embeddings (DVE) via knowledge distillation.

While this approach still enables classical semantic segmentation, e.g., via linear probing, it further enables flexible text-based querying and other applications, such as creating comprehensive 3D maps. Evaluations on common indoor datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance while meeting real-time requirements, operating at 26.3 FPS for the full model and 77.0 FPS for a smaller variant on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

The pipeline separates damage localization from reconstruction. In the first stage, a 2D convolutional network predicts damage masks on RGB slices extracted from a voxelized object, and these predictions are aggregated into a volumetric mask. In the second stage, a diffusion-based 3D U-Net performs mask-conditioned inpainting directly on voxel grids, reconstructing geometry and color while preserving observed regions. The model jointly predicts occupancy and color using a composite objective that combines occupancy reconstruction with masked color reconstruction and perceptual regularization. We evaluate the approach on a curated set of textured artifacts with synthetically generated damage using standard geometric and color metrics. Compared to symmetry-based baselines, our method produces more complete geometry and more coherent color reconstructions at a fixed 32^3 resolution.

However, most existing methods remain body-centric, focusing on large-scale motions while neglecting subtle hand articulations that are crucial for fine-grained recognition. This work presents a probabilistic dual-stream framework that unifies reliability modeling and multi-modal integration, generalizing expertized learning under uncertainty across both intra-skeleton and cross-modal domains. The framework comprises three key components: (1) a calibration-free preprocessing pipeline that removes canonical-space transformations and learns directly from native coordinates; (2) a probabilistic Noisy-OR fusion that stabilizes reliability-aware dual-stream learning without requiring explicit confidence supervision; and (3) an intra- to cross-modal ensemble that couples four skeleton modalities (Joint, Bone, Joint Motion, and Bone Motion) to RGB representations, bridging structural and visual motion cues in a unified cross-modal formulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks (NTU RGB+D~60/120, PKU-MMD, N-UCLA) and a newly defined hand-centric benchmark exhibit consistent improvements and robustness under noisy and heterogeneous conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u53cc\u6d41\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9aa8\u67b6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u624b\u90e8\u7ec6\u5fae\u52a8\u4f5c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9aa8\u67b6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8eab\u4f53\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u624b\u90e8\u7ec6\u5fae\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u6982\u7387\u53cc\u6d41\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u65e0\u6821\u51c6\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u751f\u5750\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b2) \u6982\u7387Noisy-OR\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cc\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b3) \u4ece\u9aa8\u67b6\u6a21\u6001\u5230RGB\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u8026\u5408\u56db\u79cd\u9aa8\u67b6\u6a21\u6001", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5(NTU RGB+D~60/120, PKU-MMD, N-UCLA)\u548c\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9aa8\u67b6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u624b\u90e8\u7ec6\u5fae\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd"}}

Existing vision datasets for litter detection focus on street-level still images, aerial scenes or aquatic environments, and do not reflect the unique characteristics of dashcam footage, where litter appears extremely small, sparse and embedded in cluttered road-verge backgrounds. We introduce RoLID-11K, the first large-scale dataset for roadside litter detection from dashcams, comprising over 11k annotated images spanning diverse UK driving conditions and exhibiting pronounced long-tail and small-object distributions. We benchmark a broad spectrum of modern detectors, from accuracy-oriented transformer architectures to real-time YOLO models, and analyse their strengths and limitations on this challenging task.

In particular, the automatic monitoring of product assembly progress is crucial for improving operational efficiency, minimizing the cost of discarded parts, and maximizing factory productivity. However, in cases where assembly tasks are performed manually over multiple days, implementing smart factory systems remains a challenge. Previous work has proposed Anomaly Triplet-Net, which estimates assembly progress by applying deep metric learning to the visual features of products. Nevertheless, when visual changes between consecutive tasks are subtle, misclassification often occurs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust system for estimating assembly progress, even in cases of occlusion or minimal visual change, using a small-scale dataset. Our method leverages a Quadruplet Loss-based learning approach for anomaly images and introduces a custom data loader that strategically selects training samples to enhance estimation accuracy. We evaluated our approach using a image datasets: captured during desktop PC assembly. The proposed Anomaly Quadruplet-Net outperformed existing methods on the dataset.

CPPO addresses this problem by detecting perception tokens via entropy shifts in the model outputs under perturbed input images. CPPO then extends the RL objective function with a Contrastive Perception Loss (CPL) that enforces consistency under information-preserving perturbations and sensitivity under information-removing ones.

We introduce MotionPhysics, an end-to-end differentiable framework that infers plausible physical parameters from a user-provided natural language prompt for a chosen 3D scene of interest, removing the need for guidance from ground-truth trajectories or annotated videos. Our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model to estimate material parameter values, which are constrained to lie within plausible ranges. We further propose a learnable motion distillation loss that extracts robust motion priors from pretrained video diffusion models while minimizing appearance and geometry inductive biases to guide the simulation. We evaluate MotionPhysics across more than thirty scenarios, including real-world, human-designed, and AI-generated 3D objects, spanning a wide range of materials such as elastic solids, metals, foams, sand, and both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. We demonstrate that MotionPhysics produces visually realistic dynamic simulations guided by natural language, surpassing the state of the art while automatically determining physically plausible parameters.

But extending this task to videos faces unique challenges. Existing approaches primarily focus on frame-wise degradation variation, overlooking the temporal continuity that naturally exists in real-world degradation processes. In practice, degradation types and intensities evolve smoothly over time, and multiple degradations may coexist or transition gradually. In this paper, we introduce the Smoothly Evolving Unknown Degradations (SEUD) scenario, where both the active degradation set and degradation intensity change continuously over time. To support this scenario, we design a flexible synthesis pipeline that generates temporally coherent videos with single, compound, and evolving degradations. To address the challenges in the SEUD scenario, we propose an all-in-One Recurrent Conditional and Adaptive prompting Network (ORCANet). First, a Coarse Intensity Estimation Dehazing (CIED) module estimates haze intensity using physical priors and provides coarse dehazed features as initialization. Second, a Flow Prompt Generation (FPG) module extracts degradation features. FPG generates both static prompts that capture segment-level degradation types and dynamic prompts that adapt to frame-level intensity variations. Furthermore, a label-aware supervision mechanism improves the discriminability of static prompt representations under different degradations. Extensive experiments show that ORCANet achieves superior restoration quality, temporal consistency, and robustness over image and video-based baselines.

Prior solutions typically require costly retraining or rigid external layout constraints, which can degrade aesthetics and limit flexibility. We propose \\textbf{FreeText}, a training-free, plug-and-play framework that improves text rendering by exploiting intrinsic mechanisms of \\emph{Diffusion Transformer (DiT)} models. \\textbf{FreeText} decomposes the problem into \\emph{where to write} and \\emph{what to write}. For \\emph{where to write}, we localize writing regions by reading token-wise spatial attribution from endogenous image-to-text attention, using sink-like tokens as stable spatial anchors and topology-aware refinement to produce high-confidence masks. For \\emph{what to write}, we introduce Spectral-Modulated Glyph Injection (SGMI), which injects a noise-aligned glyph prior with frequency-domain band-pass modulation to strengthen glyph structure and suppress semantic leakage (rendering the concept instead of the word).

Nevertheless, its performance is challenged when dealing with what we refer to as visually non-salient scenarios, where there is low contrast between the foreground and background. In these cases, existing methods often cannot capture accurate contours and fail to produce promising segmentation results. In this paper, we propose Visually Non-Salient SAM (VNS-SAM), aiming to enhance SAM's perception of visually non-salient scenarios while preserving its original zero-shot generalizability. We achieve this by effectively exploiting SAM's low-level features through two designs: Mask-Edge Token Interactive decoder and Non-Salient Feature Mining module. These designs help the SAM decoder gain a deeper understanding of non-salient characteristics with only marginal parameter increments and computational requirements. The additional parameters of VNS-SAM can be optimized within 4 hours, demonstrating its feasibility and practicality. In terms of data, we established VNS-SEG, a unified dataset for various VNS scenarios, with more than 35K images, in contrast to previous single-task adaptations. It is designed to make the model learn more robust VNS features and comprehensively benchmark the model's segmentation performance and generalizability on VNS scenarios. Extensive experiments across various VNS segmentation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VNS-SAM, particularly under zero-shot settings, highlighting its potential for broad real-world applications.

To address the challenges of limited space and high costs, irregular geometric transducer arrays that conform to specific imaging regions are promising for achieving high-quality 3D PAI with fewer transducers. However, traditional iterative reconstruction algorithms struggle with irregular array configurations, suffering from high computational complexity, substantial memory requirements, and lengthy reconstruction times. In this work, we introduce SlingBAG Pro, an advanced reconstruction algorithm based on the point cloud iteration concept of the Sliding ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) method, while extending its compatibility to arbitrary array geometries. SlingBAG Pro maintains high reconstruction quality, reduces the number of required transducers, and employs a hierarchical optimization strategy that combines zero-gradient filtering with progressively increased temporal sampling rates during iteration. This strategy rapidly removes redundant spatial point clouds, accelerates convergence, and significantly shortens overall reconstruction time. Compared to the original SlingBAG algorithm, SlingBAG Pro achieves up to a 2.2-fold speed improvement in point cloud-based 3D PA reconstruction under irregular array geometries.

To concretely evaluate the performance of UMMs in world knowledge scope without ambiguous metrics, we further propose Deterministic Checklist-based Evaluation (DCE), a protocol that replaces ambiguous prompt-based scoring with atomic ``Y/N'' judgments, to enhance evaluation reliability. Our extensive experiments reveal that most UMMs exhibit severe world knowledge deficits and that performance degrades significantly with complex reasoning. Additionally, simple plug-in reasoning modules can partially mitigate these vulnerabilities, highlighting a promising direction for future research.

However, robust segmentation remains a challenge in complex scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes a cascaded convolutional neural network integrated with a novel Global Information Guidance Module. This module is designed to effectively fuse low-level texture details with high-level semantic features across multiple layers, thereby overcoming the inherent limitations of single-scale feature extraction.

The primary challenge in this setting lies in the mismatch in semantic granularity between textual queries and visual content. Previous studies in ZVMR have attempted to achieve alignment by leveraging high-quality pre-trained knowledge that represents video and language in a joint space. However, these approaches failed to balance the semantic granularity between the pre-trained knowledge provided by each modality for a given scene. As a result, despite the high quality of each modality's representations, the mismatch in granularity led to inaccurate retrieval. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, called Granularity-Aware Alignment (GranAlign), that bridges this gap between coarse and fine semantic representations. Our approach introduces two complementary techniques: granularity-based query rewriting to generate varied semantic granularities, and query-aware caption generation to embed query intent into video content. By pairing multi-level queries with both query-agnostic and query-aware captions, we effectively resolve semantic mismatches. As a result, our method sets a new state-of-the-art across all three major benchmarks (QVHighlights, Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions), with a notable 3.23% mAP@avg improvement on the challenging QVHighlights dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGranAlign\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u523b\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u523b\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8054\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGranAlign\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6280\u672f\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u5199\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b2) \u67e5\u8be2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6807\u9898\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u610f\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6807\u9898\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08QVHighlights\u3001Charades-STA\u3001ActivityNet-Captions\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684QVHighlights\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0amAP@avg\u63d0\u53473.23%\u3002", "conclusion": "GranAlign\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u523b\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Safety concerns in T2M methods have been raised in recent years; existing methods replace discrete VQ-VAE codebook entries to steer the model away from unsafe behaviors. However, discrete codebook replacement-based methods have two critical flaws: firstly, replacing codebook entries which are reused by benign prompts leads to drifts on everyday tasks, degrading the model's benign performance; secondly, discrete token-based methods introduce quantization and smoothness loss, resulting in artifacts and jerky transitions. Moreover, existing text-to-motion datasets naturally contain unsafe intents and corresponding motions, making them unsuitable for safety-driven machine learning. To address these challenges, we propose SafeMo, a trustworthy motion generative framework integrating Minimal Motion Unlearning (MMU), a two-stage machine unlearning strategy, enabling safe human motion generation in continuous space, preserving continuous kinematics without codebook loss and delivering strong safety-utility trade-offs compared to current baselines. Additionally, we present the first safe text-to-motion dataset SafeMoVAE-29K integrating rewritten safe text prompts and continuous refined motion for trustworthy human motion unlearning. Built upon DiP, SafeMo efficiently generates safe human motions with natural transitions. Experiments demonstrate effective unlearning performance of SafeMo by showing strengthened forgetting on unsafe prompts, reaching 2.5x and 14.4x higher forget-set FID on HumanML3D and Motion-X respectively, compared to the previous SOTA human motion unlearning method LCR, with benign performance on safe prompts being better or comparable.

To quantify this phenomenon, we propose the Modality Dominance Index (MDI), which measures modality dominance by jointly modeling feature entropy and gradient contribution.

Leveraging powerful pre-trained architectures of ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT), we designed two specialized models: (1) a high-precision binary classifier for sprout detection, and (2) an advanced multi-class predictor to estimate weight loss and forecast remaining shelf-life with remarkable accuracy. DenseNet achieved exceptional performance, with 98.03% accuracy in sprout detection. Shelf-life prediction models performed best with coarse class divisions (2-5 classes), achieving over 89.83% accuracy, while accuracy declined for finer divisions (6-8 classes) due to subtle visual differences and limited data per class. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating image-based models into automated sorting and inventory systems, enabling early identification of sprouted potatoes and dynamic categorization based on storage stage. Practical implications include improved inventory management, differential pricing strategies, and reduced food waste across supply chains. While predicting exact shelf-life intervals remains challenging, focusing on broader class divisions ensures robust performance. Future research should aim to develop generalized models trained on diverse potato varieties and storage conditions to enhance adaptability and scalability. Overall, this approach offers a cost-effective, non-destructive method for quality assessment, supporting efficiency and sustainability in potato storage and distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08ResNet\u3001VGG\u3001DenseNet\u3001ViT\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u76d1\u6d4b\u9a6c\u94c3\u85af\u50a8\u5b58\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53d1\u82bd\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u91cd\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8d27\u67b6\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cDenseNet\u5728\u53d1\u82bd\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523098.03%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9a6c\u94c3\u85af\u50a8\u5b58\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u76d1\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53d1\u82bd\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u91cd\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8d27\u67b6\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u62e3\u548c\u5e93\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728200\u5929\u53d7\u63a7\u6e29\u6e7f\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6536\u96c6\u9a6c\u94c3\u85af\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u91cd\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528ResNet\u3001VGG\u3001DenseNet\u548cVision Transformer\u7b49\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u53d1\u82bd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u91cd\u91cf\u635f\u5931/\u8d27\u67b6\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "DenseNet\u5728\u53d1\u82bd\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe98.03%\uff1b\u8d27\u67b6\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u7c97\u5206\u7c7b\uff082-5\u7c7b\uff09\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc789.83%\uff0c\u7ec6\u5206\u7c7b\uff086-8\u7c7b\uff09\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u50cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u9a6c\u94c3\u85af\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u98df\u7269\u6d6a\u8d39\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u54c1\u79cd\u548c\u50a8\u5b58\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Spaceborne SAR tomography (TomoSAR) provides weather-independent, side-looking observations that capture facade-level structure, offering a promising alternative to conventional optical methods. However, TomoSAR point clouds often suffer from noise, anisotropic point distributions, and data voids on incoherent surfaces, all of which hinder accurate height reconstruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a learning-based framework for converting raw TomoSAR points into high-resolution building height maps. Our dual-topology network alternates between a point branch that models irregular scatterer features and a grid branch that enforces spatial consistency. By jointly processing these representations, the network denoises the input points and inpaints missing regions to produce continuous height estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of concept for large-scale urban height mapping directly from TomoSAR point clouds. Extensive experiments on data from Munich and Berlin validate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we demonstrate that our framework can be extended to incorporate optical satellite imagery, further enhancing reconstruction quality.

Existing training-free methods address hallucinations but face two limitations: (i) they rely on narrow assumptions about hallucination sources, and (ii) their effectiveness declines toward the end of generation, where hallucinations are most likely to occur. A common strategy is to build hallucinated models by completely or partially removing visual tokens and contrasting them with the original model. Yet, this alone proves insufficient, since visual information still propagates into generated text. Building on this insight, we propose a novel hallucinated model that captures hallucination effects by selectively removing key text tokens. We further introduce Generalized Contrastive Decoding, which integrates multiple hallucinated models to represent diverse hallucination sources.

Williamson", "Paul Henderson"], "title": "Pixel-to-4D: Camera-Controlled Image-to-Video Generation with Dynamic 3D Gaussians", "comment": null, "summary": "Humans excel at forecasting the future dynamics of a scene given just a single image. Video generation models that can mimic this ability are an essential component for intelligent systems. Recent approaches have improved temporal coherence and 3D consistency in single-image-conditioned video generation. However, these methods often lack robust user controllability, such as modifying the camera path, limiting their applicability in real-world applications. Most existing camera-controlled image-to-video models struggle with accurately modeling camera motion, maintaining temporal consistency, and preserving geometric integrity. Leveraging explicit intermediate 3D representations offers a promising solution by enabling coherent video generation aligned with a given camera trajectory. Although these methods often use 3D point clouds to render scenes and introduce object motion in a later stage, this two-step process still falls short in achieving full temporal consistency, despite allowing precise control over camera movement. We propose a novel framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian scene representation and samples plausible object motion, given a single image in a single forward pass. This enables fast, camera-guided video generation without the need for iterative denoising to inject object motion into render frames. Extensive experiments on the KITTI, Waymo, RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art video quality and inference efficiency.

Oftentimes, deep learning is utilized to perform image demosaicing. Given that most modern digital imaging applications occur on mobile platforms, applying deep learning to demosaicing requires lightweight and efficient networks. Isotropic networks, also known as residual-in-residual networks, have been often employed for image demosaicing and joint-demosaicing-and-denoising (JDD). Most demosaicing isotropic networks avoid spatial downsampling entirely, and thus are often prohibitively expensive computationally for mobile applications. Contrary to previous isotropic network designs, this paper claims that spatial downsampling to a signficant degree can improve the efficiency and performance of isotropic networks. To validate this claim, we design simple fully convolutional networks with and without downsampling using a mathematical architecture design technique adapted from DeepMAD, and find that downsampling improves empirical performance. Additionally, empirical testing of the downsampled variant, JD3Net, of our fully convolutional networks reveals strong empirical performance on a variety of image demosaicing and JDD tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86JD3Net\u7f51\u7edc\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u6210\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e2d\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u907f\u514d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528DeepMAD\u6570\u5b66\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5e26\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4e0d\u5e26\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86JD3Net\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0cJD3Net\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u548c\u8054\u5408\u53bb\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u53bb\u566a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0e\u4ee5\u5f80\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, after deployment, their performance may deteriorate when the input data distribution shifts from that observed during development. Detecting such performance degradation is essential for clinical reliability, yet remains challenging for large pre-trained VLMs operating without labeled data. In this study, we investigate performance degradation detection under data shift in a state-of-the-art pathology VLM. We examine both input-level data shift and output-level prediction behavior to understand their respective roles in monitoring model reliability. To facilitate systematic analysis of input data shift, we develop DomainSAT, a lightweight toolbox with a graphical interface that integrates representative shift detection algorithms and enables intuitive exploration of data shift. Our analysis shows that while input data shift detection is effective at identifying distributional changes and providing early diagnostic signals, it does not always correspond to actual performance degradation. Motivated by this observation, we further study output-based monitoring and introduce a label-free, confidence-based degradation indicator that directly captures changes in model prediction confidence. We find that this indicator exhibits a close relationship with performance degradation and serves as an effective complement to input shift detection. Experiments on a large-scale pathology dataset for tumor classification demonstrate that combining input data shift detection and output confidence-based indicators enables more reliable detection and interpretation of performance degradation in VLMs under data shift. These findings provide a practical and complementary framework for monitoring the reliability of foundation models in digital pathology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u533b\u7597\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86DomainSAT\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\uff0c\u5f53\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLM\u6765\u8bf4\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u5f00\u53d1DomainSAT\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u504f\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u56fe\u5f62\u754c\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u5206\u6790\uff1b2) \u7814\u7a76\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff1b4) \u5728\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u5bf9\u5e94\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u9000\u5316\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u8f93\u5165\u504f\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91caVLM\u5728\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their applicability is limited in more volatile scenarios, such as remanufacturing, where the inspected products and defect patterns often change. In such settings, deployed models require frequent adaptation to novel conditions, effectively posing a continual learning problem. To enable quick adaptation, the necessary training processes must be computationally efficient while still avoiding effects like catastrophic forgetting. This work presents a multi-level feature fusion (MLFF) approach that aims to improve both aspects simultaneously by utilizing representations from different depths of a pretrained network.

We present an end-to-end workflow for grading scanned handwritten engineering quizzes with multimodal large language models (LLMs) that preserves the standard exam process (A4 paper, unconstrained student handwriting). The lecturer provides only a handwritten reference solution (100%) and a short set of grading rules; the reference is converted into a text-only summary that conditions grading without exposing the reference scan. Reliability is achieved through a multi-stage design with a format/presence check to prevent grading blank answers, an ensemble of independent graders, supervisor aggregation, and rigid templates with deterministic validation to produce auditable, machine-parseable reports. We evaluate the frozen pipeline in a clean-room protocol on a held-out real course quiz in Slovenian, including hand-drawn circuit schematics. With state-of-the-art backends (GPT-5.2 and Gemini-3 Pro), the full pipeline achieves $\\approx$8-point mean absolute difference to lecturer grades with low bias and an estimated manual-review trigger rate of $\\approx$17% at $D_{\\max}=40$.

Instead of following the prevailing cascade, we rethink how primitives and points should interact, and find it more effective to decode primitives in a dedicated pathway that attends to shared shape features. Following this principle, we present UniCo, which in a single feed-forward pass predicts a set of primitives with complete geometry, semantics, and inlier membership. To drive this unified representation, we introduce primitive proxies, learnable queries that are contextualized to produce assembly-ready outputs. To ensure consistent optimization, our training strategy couples primitives and points with online target updates. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks with four independent assembly solvers, UniCo consistently outperforms recent baselines, lowering Chamfer distance by up to 50% and improving normal consistency by up to 7%. These results establish an attractive recipe for structured 3D understanding from incomplete data.

In this work, we propose two novel deep learning architectures called LNU-Net and IBU-Net for left ventricle segmentation from short-axis cine MRI images.

The architectures of LNU-Net and IBU-Net have a down-sampling path for feature extraction and an up-sampling path for precise localization. We use the original U-Net as the basic segmentation approach and compared it with our proposed architectures. Both LNU-Net and IBU-Net have left ventricle segmentation methods: LNU-Net applies layer normalization in each convolutional block, while IBU-Net incorporates instance and batch normalization together in the first convolutional block and passes its result to the next layer. Our method incorporates affine transformations and elastic deformations for image data processing.

Existing methods using single Gaussian primitives are limited by their low-pass filtering nature, while standard Gabor functions introduce energy instability. Moreover, lack of temporal continuity constraints often leads to motion artifacts during interpolation. We propose AdaGaR, a unified framework addressing both frequency adaptivity and temporal continuity in explicit dynamic scene modeling. We introduce Adaptive Gabor Representation, extending Gaussians through learnable frequency weights and adaptive energy compensation to balance detail capture and stability. For temporal continuity, we employ Cubic Hermite Splines with Temporal Curvature Regularization to ensure smooth motion evolution. An Adaptive Initialization mechanism combining depth estimation, point tracking, and foreground masks establishes stable point cloud distributions in early training. Experiments on Tap-Vid DAVIS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (PSNR 35.49, SSIM 0.9433, LPIPS 0.0723) and strong generalization across frame interpolation, depth consistency, video editing, and stereo view synthesis.
