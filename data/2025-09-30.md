### [1] [Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22674)
*Yash Thube*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATS是一个紧凑的行为审计工具，用于评估视觉语言模型是否拒绝视觉矛盾的陈述，提出了空间一致性评分和错误同意率两个指标。研究发现指令调优的生成式VLM表现较差，而对比编码器更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基准测试可能掩盖系统性的失败，降低真实世界的可信度。需要一种方法来测量模型是否拒绝视觉矛盾的陈述。

Method: 引入MATS行为审计，测量模型对视觉矛盾陈述的拒绝能力，使用空间一致性评分和错误同意率两个指标。通过激活修补因果定位失败位置。

Result: 指令调优的生成式VLM表现出很低的空间一致性评分和很高的错误同意率，而对比编码器则稳健得多。失败位置定位在生成式模型的中后期交叉注意力层和对比模型的池化投影组件。

Conclusion: MATS揭示了VLM在视觉矛盾检测方面的系统性失败，并提出了具体的修复路径。对比编码器比生成式VLM在视觉一致性方面更可靠。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

### [2] [Scale and Rotation Estimation of Similarity-Transformed Images via Cross-Correlation Maximization Based on Auxiliary Function Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22686)
*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于傅里叶变换和互相关最大化的高效算法，能够以亚像素精度联合估计图像间的尺度和旋转变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相位相关技术只能处理平移偏移，无法有效处理相机缩放或旋转引起的尺度和旋转变化，这在医学成像和计算机视觉中很常见。

Method: 将傅里叶变换在极对数坐标下的尺度旋转估计与互相关最大化策略相结合，利用辅助函数方法，并引入亚像素级互相关。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在尺度和旋转估计上的平均误差低于传统的基于离散互相关的傅里叶变换技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够精确地联合估计尺度和旋转，在图像配准任务中优于传统方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

### [3] [Robust Object Detection for Autonomous Driving via Curriculum-Guided Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22688)
*Xu Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出强化学习框架，通过课程数据调度和难度感知过滤增强GRPO，提升多模态检测的精度和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言推理表现出色，但在需要精确定位和鲁棒性的结构化感知任务中表现不佳

Method: 强化学习框架，结合课程数据调度和难度感知过滤的Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)

Result: 在自动驾驶基准测试中显著提升检测精度和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 基于结构化数据课程的强化驱动优化是实现鲁棒可解释多模态检测的可扩展路径

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning
but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise
localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that
augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data
scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes
optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to
complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum
pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight
reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable
path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

### [4] [Graph-Theoretic Consistency for Robust and Topology-Aware Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22689)
*Ha-Hieu Pham,Minh Le,Han Huynh,Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le,Huy-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出拓扑图一致性(TGC)框架，通过拉普拉斯谱对齐、组件计数和邻接统计来增强半监督语义分割，在病理图像上取得SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督语义分割中像素级一致性方法传播噪声伪标签、产生碎片化或拓扑无效掩码的问题

Method: 集成图论约束，在预测图和参考图之间对齐拉普拉斯谱、组件计数和邻接统计

Result: 在GlaS和CRAG数据集上，使用5-10%监督实现SOTA性能，显著缩小与全监督的差距

Conclusion: TGC通过强制执行全局拓扑结构，提高了分割准确性，为计算病理学中的半监督分割提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at
https://github.com/hieuphamha19/TGC.

### [5] [A review of Recent Techniques for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22690)
*Andrea Asperti,Salvatore Fiorilla,Simone Nardi,Lorenzo Orsini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文是一篇关于行人重识别技术的综述，重点比较了监督学习和无监督学习方法的发展现状，指出无监督方法正在缩小与监督方法的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习方法虽然性能优越但依赖大量标注数据，存在可扩展性问题。无监督学习方法利用大量未标注数据，近年来显示出有希望的发展，性能差距正在缩小。

Method: 采用双焦点综述方法：首先回顾和分类监督学习行人重识别的重要文献，深入概述当前最先进技术；其次探索过去三年无监督行人重识别的最新进展。

Result: 监督学习方法已趋于成熟，改进空间有限；无监督学习方法显示出与监督方法性能趋同的潜力，是未来研究的重要方向。

Conclusion: 该综述捕捉了监督技术的成熟格局和无监督学习领域的有希望成果，为行人重识别的演进叙事做出了贡献。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

### [6] [Sequential Token Merging: Revisiting Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22691)
*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Sequential Token Merging (STM)方法，通过双向最近邻合并和隐藏状态保护来优化Vision Mamba模型，在显著减少计算量的同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba模型虽然具有次二次复杂度，但其效率仍受限于图像分辨率带来的二次令牌缩放。现有方法忽略了ViM固有的有限方向序列依赖性(LDSD)这一关键信息流机制。

Method: STM方法包含：1）双向最近邻合并，通过对称空间聚合保持序列依赖性；2）隐藏状态保护，稳定类别令牌周围的隐藏状态。该方法利用Mamba的逐层损失收敛将时间遗忘转化为稳定性。

Result: 实验显示STM在ViM-Ti上减少20%令牌时仅损失1.0%准确率，在ViM-S上减少40%令牌时仅损失1.4%准确率，实现了最先进的效率。

Conclusion: STM方法以最小复杂度实现了最优效率，并为状态空间模型动态提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

TL;DR: 这是一篇关于超分辨率技术的全面综述论文，涵盖了单图像超分辨率、视频超分辨率、立体超分辨率和光场超分辨率等多个领域，分析了超过150种SISR方法、近70种VSR方法以及约30种SSR和LFSR技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习技术的发展和对高质量视觉应用需求的增长，超分辨率领域发展迅速。现有综述大多局限于特定领域，缺乏对该领域的全面概述。

Method: 作者对各类超分辨率方法进行了深入回顾，包括方法论、数据集、评估协议、经验结果和复杂度分析，并根据不同的骨干结构进行了分类。

Conclusion: 这项工作将为超分辨率领域的研究者提供有价值的资源和指导，并探讨了该领域中一些有价值但研究不足的开放性问题。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific
domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of this field. Here, we present an
in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single image
super-resolution (SISR), video super-resolution (VSR), stereo super-resolution
(SSR), and light field super-resolution (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150
SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will
serve as a valuable resource and offer guidance to researchers in this domain.
To facilitate access to related work, we created a dedicated repository

### [8] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP风格对比学习框架的视觉语言模型，用于高光谱图像场景理解，仅需更新0.07%的参数即可实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据需求增长，高效学习越来越依赖于高质量数据的筛选和提炼。高光谱图像具有高维3D体素结构，其跨模态对齐问题尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用CLIP风格的对比训练框架，将视觉主干网络提取的体素级嵌入映射到冻结的大型嵌入模型的潜在空间，通过可训练探针对齐视觉特征与文本标记表示，使用硬负样本和半硬负样本进行对比学习。

Result: 在Indian Pines数据集上比单模态和多模态基线方法OA提升0.92%、Kappa提升1.60；在Pavia University数据集上OA提升0.69%、Kappa提升0.90。参数量比DCTN小50倍，比SS-TMNet小90倍。

Conclusion: 该方法仅更新极少量参数即可实现高光谱图像场景理解的最先进性能，证明了在数据筛选和模型优化方面的有效性。

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

### [9] [Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking for One-Shot Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22700)
*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GPR-NIAM方法，通过注意力隔离和跨模态知识对齐实现单轮联邦提示学习，在数据异构环境下提升跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法依赖多轮通信，且缺乏跨任务泛化能力。需要开发单轮通信方法来解决数据异构性和跨任务泛化问题。

Method: GPR-NIAM包含两个核心模块：注意力隔离模块限制可学习提示与原始文本嵌入的过度交互，跨模态协作精炼模块整合分散的视觉知识并校准全局提示。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上的实验表明，GPR-NIAM在类别级和领域级泛化方面优于8种最先进方法。

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM通过有效的注意力控制和跨模态知识整合，实现了单轮联邦提示学习，在数据异构环境下具有优异的跨任务泛化性能。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

*Ahed Alboody*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GZSL-MoE模型，将混合专家层集成到生成式零样本学习框架中，用于3D点云语义分割，在COVERED数据集上提升了对可见和未见类别的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云语义分割中训练数据不完整的问题，特别是在人机协作环境中，当无法获得所有对象类别的全面训练数据时，需要一种能够识别未见类别的方法。

Method: 将混合专家层集成到生成式零样本学习的生成器和判别器中，使用预训练的KPConv模型提取特征，生成与真实特征相似的伪特征来训练模型识别未见类别。

Result: GZSL-MoE模型在COVERED数据集上表现出色，能够同时提升对可见和未见类别的分割性能。

Conclusion: 结合生成式零样本学习和混合专家的GZSL-MoE模型为理解复杂3D环境提供了有前景的解决方案，特别是在训练数据不完整的情况下。

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

*Adithya Giri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IBiT通过引入学习掩码为Vision Transformers添加归纳偏置，使其能在小数据集上有效学习，无需知识蒸馏


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在计算机视觉中占主导地位，但缺乏CNN的归纳偏置，需要大数据集才能学习这些偏置

Method: 通过学习的掩码为Vision Transformers引入归纳偏置

Result: IBiT在小数据集上显著更准确，同时保持Transformer的可解释性

Conclusion: 通过学习的掩码引入归纳偏置可使Vision Transformers在小数据集上有效工作

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

### [12] [LayoutAgent: A Vision-Language Agent Guided Compositional Diffusion for Spatial Layout Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22720)
*Zezhong Fan,Xiaohan Li,Luyi Ma,Kai Zhao,Liang Peng,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kaushiki Nag,Kannan Achan*

TL;DR: LayoutAgent是一个结合视觉语言推理和组合扩散的智能框架，用于生成物理合理且语义丰富的多目标场景布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型缺乏显式空间推理能力，导致物体布局不真实；而传统机器人空间规划方法难以捕捉视觉场景的语义丰富性。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型预处理输入图像（分割、物体尺寸估计、场景图构建、提示重写），然后利用组合扩散方法合成符合场景图关系的边界框，最后通过前景条件图像生成器渲染完整场景。

Result: 实验表明LayoutAgent在布局一致性、空间真实性和美学对齐方面优于其他最先进的布局生成模型。

Conclusion: LayoutAgent成功弥合了视觉生成和空间规划之间的差距，实现了物理合理且语义丰富的场景布局生成。

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompareBench是一个评估视觉语言模型视觉比较推理能力的基准，包含1000个QA对，涵盖数量、时间、几何和空间四个任务，揭示了当前VLMs在视觉比较方面的系统性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉比较推理是视觉语言模型的基本但研究不足的能力，需要专门的基准来评估和推动该领域发展。

Method: 构建CompareBench基准，包含1000个QA对，分为数量(600)、时间(100)、几何(200)和空间(100)四个任务，基于自建的TallyBench(2000张计数图像)和HistCaps(515张历史图像)数据集。评估了闭源API(OpenAI、Gemini、Claude)和开源模型(Qwen2.5-VL和Qwen3-VL系列)。

Result: 结果显示明显的扩展趋势，但也暴露了关键局限：即使最强模型在时间排序和空间关系上持续失败，在基础计数和几何比较等人类认为简单的问题上也经常出错。

Conclusion: 视觉比较是当前VLMs的系统性盲点，CompareBench通过提供受控、多样和诊断性评估，为推进更可靠的多模态推理奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILR是一种在测试时联合推理图像和文本的方法，通过在统一潜在向量空间中搜索离散标记的向量表示来实现跨模态推理，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于推理的图像生成方法要么局限于单一模态（图像或文本），要么依赖高质量推理数据进行微调。为了解决这些限制，需要开发能够在测试时联合推理图像和文本的方法。

Method: 提出MILR方法，在统一潜在向量空间中联合推理图像和文本，通过策略梯度方法在离散图像和文本标记的向量表示中进行搜索，由图像质量评估器指导。该方法在MUG框架中实现，完全在测试时运行。

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和WISE基准测试中均取得最先进结果。在知识密集型的WISE上，MILR获得0.63的总分，比基线提高了80%。分析表明统一潜在空间中的联合推理是其强性能的关键。

Conclusion: MILR展示了在时间和文化推理方面的非平凡能力，证明了该推理方法的有效性。联合推理在统一潜在空间中是实现强大性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

TL;DR: 提出了UESA-Net，一种用于乳腺和甲状腺超声图像分割的U型网络，通过多方向收缩注意力机制解决全局上下文与局部细节的语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺和甲状腺癌负担日益加重，超声成像存在斑点噪声、结构重叠和全局-局部特征交互弱等问题，现有网络难以平衡高级语义与低级空间细节。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，在编码块中使用水平、垂直和深度方向的多方向注意力模块，结合收缩（阈值）策略整合先验知识和局部特征；解码器采用成对收缩机制结合先验低级物理线索。

Result: 在TN3K（3493张图像）和BUSI（780张图像）数据集上分别达到0.8487和0.6495的交并比（IoU）分数，性能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: UESA-Net通过聚合多方向空间信息和先验知识，有效提高了乳腺和甲状腺超声分割的鲁棒性和准确性，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

*Fernando Julio Cendra,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartCo是一个通过引入部件级对应先验来增强广义类别发现性能的新框架，能够在不显著修改现有方法的情况下提升GCD方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要依赖语义标签和全局图像表示，忽略了区分密切相关类别所需的关键部件级线索。

Method: PartCo通过利用部件级视觉特征对应关系，捕捉更细粒度的语义结构，从而更细致地理解类别关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，PartCo显著提升了当前GCD方法的性能，实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: PartCo通过弥合语义标签和部件级视觉组合之间的差距，为GCD设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new
benchmarks for GCD. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/partco

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT是一种分解式高效微调框架，通过将预训练权重矩阵的更新分解为两个可训练矩阵组件：在低秩子空间补集上的投影和低秩更新，实现了在个性化、多任务统一和可编辑性之间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像模型高效微调中面临的挑战：在目标分布对齐（从有限图像学习新概念）、保持多任务统一所需的指令能力以及维持可编辑性之间找到平衡。

Method: DEFT框架将预训练权重矩阵更新分解为两个组件：一个在由低秩矩阵张成的低秩子空间补集上的投影，另一个是低秩更新。单个可训练低秩矩阵定义子空间，另一个可训练低秩矩阵在该子空间内实现灵活参数适应。

Result: 在Dreambooth、Dreambench Plus（个性化）、InsDet（对象和场景适应）、VisualCloze（视觉上下文学习的通用图像生成）数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Stable Diffusion和统一模型中均实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DEFT框架展示了高效微调的新兴特性，在保持计算效率和参数效率的同时，实现了在个性化、多任务适应和可编辑性方面的优异表现。

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

TL;DR: VideoScore2是一个多维、可解释、与人类对齐的视频评估框架，能够评估视觉质量、文本-视频对齐和物理/常识一致性，并提供详细的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频评估方法仅限于单一不透明分数，缺乏可解释性，或仅提供粗略分析，无法全面评估视频质量的多方面特性。

Method: 使用包含27,168个人工标注视频的大规模数据集VideoFeedback2，采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调后使用GRPO进行强化学习，以增强分析鲁棒性。

Result: 在VideoScore-Bench-v2基准上达到44.35准确率（提升5.94），在四个域外基准上平均性能达到50.37（提升4.32）。

Conclusion: VideoScore2在提供可解释评估的同时实现了优越性能，通过有效的奖励建模为可控生成搭建了桥梁。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between
evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for
Best-of-N sampling. Project Page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VideoScore2/

TL;DR: TRUST是一种针对状态空间模型（SSMs）的测试时自适应方法，通过利用多样化的遍历排列生成多个因果视角，使用模型预测作为伪标签来更新Mamba特定参数，从而提高在分布偏移下的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型（SSMs）作为视觉Transformer的高效替代方案，在分布偏移下泛化性能显著下降，需要专门的自适应方法来提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TRUST方法：利用多样化遍历排列生成输入图像的多个因果视角，使用模型预测作为伪标签指导Mamba特定参数的更新，并通过平均适应权重整合不同遍历扫描的学习信息。

Result: 在七个基准测试上的实验表明，TRUST持续提升鲁棒性，并优于现有的测试时自适应方法。

Conclusion: TRUST是首个明确利用SSMs独特架构特性进行自适应的方法，有效解决了SSMs在分布偏移下的泛化性能下降问题。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPB是首个评估视觉语言模型个性化能力的大规模基准，包含10k图像-查询对和111个可个性化概念，涵盖人类、动物、物体和角色四类。研究发现大多数VLM在个性化方面表现不佳，特别是在对话一致性、用户偏好处理和视觉线索适应方面存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉个性化在面向用户的AI系统中至关重要，但现有的大规模视觉语言模型在适应个体用户方面的能力尚未得到充分探索。需要建立一个全面的基准来评估VLM的个性化能力。

Method: 构建包含10k图像-查询对和111个可个性化概念的MMPB基准，将个性化任务分为三种类型，使用23个开源和闭源VLM进行三阶段评估：概念注入、多轮对话和个性化查询。

Result: 大多数VLM在个性化方面表现不佳，特别是在保持对话一致性、处理用户偏好和适应视觉线索方面存在困难。研究发现拒绝行为和长上下文遗忘等挑战表明VLM个性化仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: MMPB基准揭示了VLM在个性化方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解和坚实基础，推动真正个性化的多模态AI发展。

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可控对抗补丁生成框架，允许攻击者自由选择输入图像和目标类别，实现精确误分类，在保持视觉真实性的同时达到99%以上的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗补丁攻击方法存在白盒假设不现实、非目标攻击或产生视觉明显补丁等限制，难以在实际场景中应用。

Method: 结合生成式U-Net设计和Grad-CAM引导的补丁放置，实现语义感知定位，最大化攻击效果同时保持视觉真实性。

Result: 在卷积网络和视觉变换器上的广泛实验表明，该方法在所有设置下都达到最先进性能，攻击成功率和目标类别成功率均超过99%。

Conclusion: 该框架同时确保了真实性、目标控制和黑盒适用性这三个最具挑战性的维度，为对抗鲁棒性研究建立了新基准。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

TL;DR: CrossScaleNet是一种结合跨注意力机制和多尺度处理的时间序列预测架构，既能实现高性能又能提供时间可解释性，在预测准确性和时间显著性检测方面都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的时间显著性检测后处理方法计算成本高，特别是在与特征重要性检测相比时。虽然消融技术对于特征较少的数据集可能足够，但由于其复杂性，识别时间显著性面临更大挑战。

Method: 提出CrossScaleNet架构，结合基于补丁的跨注意力机制和多尺度处理，在训练过程中嵌入注意力机制，为时间显著性提供内在可解释性。

Result: 在具有已知显著性真实值的合成数据集和已建立的公共基准上验证了CrossScaleNet，实验表明该方法在时间显著性检测和预测准确性方面都表现出优越性能，在真实世界数据集上持续优于大多数基于Transformer的模型。

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet解决了现有声称可解释性的模型往往无法在标准基准上保持强性能的差距，提供了一种平衡的方法，既能有效捕捉时间显著性，又能在不同复杂度的数据集上提供最先进的预测性能。

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是全球癌症相关死亡的主要原因，精确分割内部肿瘤体积对放射治疗至关重要，但面临标注数据有限和PET信号边界衰减的挑战。

Method: 使用预训练在GTV数据集上的多模态交互感知网络，在私有IGTV数据集上微调，并引入切片交互模块来建模切片间关系。

Result: 在私有IGTV数据集上达到Dice系数0.609，显著优于传统基线的0.385。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了迁移学习结合先进多模态技术和SIM模块在提高IGTV分割可靠性和临床相关性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their
bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic
range. However, obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based
vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present
ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize
high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text
labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the
diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model
performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based
on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based
generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习式配准方法需要大量训练数据且精度有限，隐式神经表示方法需要实例特定优化，计算效率和稳定性是关键问题。

Method: 集成Kolmogorov-Arnold网络到隐式神经表示配准框架，提出随机基函数采样策略减少基函数数量，降低计算成本。

Result: 在肺CT、脑MRI、心脏MRI三个数据集上，KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR在INR方法中精度最高，计算开销最小，学习稳定性最优。

Conclusion: RandKAN-IDIR在消除额外训练复杂度的情况下，性能略优于可学习基函数索引模型，为医学图像配准提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集合输入网络（如Deep Sets和Set Transformer）只能处理向量输入，需要与CNN特征提取器级联，无法直接处理3D图像张量，限制了性能提升。

Method: CST直接在3D图像张量上操作，同时执行特征提取和上下文建模，支持CNN可解释性方法如Grad-CAM，并可通过标准迁移学习方案进行预训练和适应。

Result: 在集合分类和集合异常检测任务中表现优于现有方法，提供了更好的可解释性，并发布了在ImageNet上预训练的CST-15骨干网络。

Conclusion: CST是一种高效的集合图像处理架构，能够直接处理3D图像张量，实现特征提取和上下文建模的协同作用，在多个任务中取得优异性能并具有良好的可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Conclusion: TY-RIST在红外小目标检测中有效平衡了精度与效率，显著提升性能的同时实现实时推理，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and
surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal
features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections
from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,
we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a
stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution
detection head, (3) cascaded coordinate attention blocks, and (4) a branch
pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance
regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20
different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5
IoU by +7.9%, Precision by +3%, and Recall by +10.2%, while achieving up to 123
FPS on a single GPU. Cross-dataset validation on a fifth dataset further
confirms strong generalization capability. Additional results and resources are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅的参数化表示具有非唯一性和异构性，直接作为特征输入神经网络会导致高度数据依赖的模型，需要更原则性的表示方法。

Method: 基于连续子流形场构建嵌入表示，封装高斯基元的固有信息，保持颜色和几何结构，同时强制唯一映射和通道同质性。

Result: 该方法能够更好地保留3D高斯泼溅的底层结构，有利于3DGS的学习。

Conclusion: 提出的嵌入表示方法为基于3D高斯泼溅的学习系统提供了更有效的特征表示方案。

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出软嵌入方法，将一步生成器中的离散标记替换为输出分布的期望嵌入，使模型可微分，支持对抗训练、奖励微调和测试时嵌入优化，显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有一步生成器存在两个关键限制：继承教师模型的建模偏差，以及离散标记输出阻碍梯度流动，无法进行对抗训练、奖励微调等后蒸馏优化。

Method: 引入软嵌入方法，用生成器输出分布的期望嵌入替代离散标记，创建完全可微分的连续代理，与教师主干和标记器解码器兼容，集成到Di[M]O蒸馏框架中形成Soft-Di[M]O。

Result: 在多个掩码扩散模型教师上，Soft-Di[M]O实现最先进的一步生成效果：改进的类别到图像性能，在ImageNet-256上通过GAN优化获得1.56的FID，文本到图像任务上获得更高的GenEval和HPS分数，并通过TTEO获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: 软嵌入使一步生成器可端到端训练，支持多种优化技术，显著提升生成质量，为高效文本和图像合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统海洋生物图像识别面临数据集不完整和模型精度不足的问题，特别是在稀有物种的少样本条件下，数据稀缺严重影响了识别性能。

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

Motivation: 解决颅内出血CT扫描AI开发中公共数据碎片化的问题，为开发稳健的AI解决方案提供统一、细粒度的基准数据集。

Method: 收集2012-2024年间的372个头部CT检查，采用双读工作流程进行五种ICH亚型的详尽标注，包括分类标签、边界框、像素掩码和体素掩码，并通过神经外科医生裁决确保标注质量。

Conclusion: Hemorica为ICH检测和量化系统的AI助手设计提供了统一的多任务基准，支持课程学习和向弱标注数据集的迁移。

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

<details>

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成质量上表现优异，但由于非因果生成方式，在多视角一致性方面存在局限，难以适应世界建模任务。自回归模型具有因果特性，更适合处理视图间的一致性关系。

Method: 使用视频分词器将图像序列离散化为token，相机编码器将相机轨迹转换为3D位置引导，并提出自回归Transformer模块在保持时间顺序的同时随机置换空间顺序。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法在性能上可与基于扩散模型的最先进视图合成方法相媲美甚至更优。

Conclusion: ARSS证明了自回归模型在视图合成任务中的有效性，为世界建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动作识别模型过度依赖静态线索而非动态人体运动，这种静态偏差导致在现实应用和零样本动作识别中表现不佳。

Method: 使用统计独立性损失在偏置和无偏置流之间，结合场景预测损失来分离时间动态信息和静态场景信息。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效减少静态偏差，并确认了场景预测损失的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过分离动态和静态信息的方法能够有效缓解动作识别中的静态偏差问题。

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

Conclusion: 提出的DesenAT方法通过特征脱敏和自蒸馏成功减轻了DNN对点云特征的过度依赖，显著提高了模型对损坏点云的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来使用统一多模态模型进行推理和决策的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

Conclusion: DPM为生成AI时代的知识产权保护提供了可解释且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

### [41] [GeLoc3r: Enhancing Relative Camera Pose Regression with Geometric Consistency Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23038)
*Jingxing Li,Yongjae Lee,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeLoc3r通过几何一致性正则化(GCR)增强相对相机姿态回归方法，在保持ReLoc3R快速推理速度的同时，接近MASt3R基于对应关系方法的高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ReLoc3R内部表示的几何不一致性问题，克服回归方法速度与精度之间的权衡困境。

Method: 训练时利用真实深度生成密集3D-2D对应关系，通过FusionTransformer学习对应关系重要性，使用加权RANSAC计算几何一致姿态，创建一致性损失将几何知识转移到回归网络中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于ReLoc3R：CO3Dv2数据集AUC@5°从34.85%提升到40.45%，RealEstate10K从66.70%提升到68.66%，MegaDepth1500从49.60%提升到50.45%。

Conclusion: 通过在训练而非推理时教授几何一致性，GeLoc3r实现了神经网络学习相机几何的范式转变，兼具回归方法的速度和对应关系方法的几何理解。

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了深度学习模型学习中风患者动作特征的潜力，未来可扩展到不仅简单动作识别，还能提供有助于家庭康复的评估反馈。

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

TL;DR: 提出基于激活匹配的方法来生成预训练分类器决策的最小化忠实解释，通过训练轻量级自编码器输出二进制掩码，保留模型预测和中间激活。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要为预训练分类器的决策提供最小化、忠实的解释，既能保持模型行为又能去除不相关输入区域。

Method: 训练轻量级自编码器生成二进制掩码，结合多层级激活匹配（KL散度和交叉熵）、掩码先验（L1面积、二值化惩罚、总变差）和溯因约束。

Result: 生成的小型、人类可解释的掩码能够保留分类器行为，同时丢弃不相关输入区域。

Conclusion: 该方法能够为底层模型的决策提供实用且忠实的最小化解释。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像等专业领域标注数据稀缺，现有自监督掩码图像建模方法依赖随机高比例掩码，导致效率低下和语义对齐不佳，需要更智能的掩码策略。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型进行基于提示的区域定位，对诊断相关区域应用差异化掩码，减少背景区域的冗余，实现可控的文本引导掩码。

Result: 在脑部MRI、胸部CT和肺部X射线等多种医学成像模态上，该方法在分类准确率上提升达+3.1个百分点，检测任务中BoxAP提升+1.3，MaskAP提升+1.1，且掩码比例显著降低（40% vs 70%）。

Conclusion: 可控的文本驱动掩码能够实现语义对齐的自监督学习，推动医学图像分析中鲁棒视觉模型的发展。

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空视角小目标检测面临视觉线索有限和全局上下文建模困难的问题，现有方法存在上下文融合延迟和非线性建模不足的瓶颈。

Method: 提出WeKat主干网络使用小波变换增强全局低频上下文感知，结合Kolmogorov-Arnold网络进行自适应非线性建模；引入轻量级CPF模块减少冗余；使用MDFC模块统一空间、频率和结构先验。

Result: 在基准航空视角数据集上达到最先进性能，参数更少。在VisDrone数据集上AP提升6.5%，AP50提升8.2%。

Conclusion: FMC-DETR通过频率解耦融合有效解决了航空视角小目标检测的挑战，在保持细节的同时增强全局信息，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回归基础，重新审视实现偏好对齐的基本问题，而不是引入新方法。

Method: 利用直接偏好优化方法进行对齐训练，使用公共奖励模型构建偏好训练数据集。

Result: 在9个奖励模型、2个基准和2个基线模型上的实验表明：大多数奖励模型能提供有效奖励分数；偏好数据在不同模型和基准中表现出稳健趋势；奖励模型存在亮度、构图和色彩方案等偏见；简单集成能缓解这些偏见。

Conclusion: 对齐模型在标准指标、GPT-4评估和人工评估中显著优于先前模型，无需改变模型结构或使用新数据集，为这一有前景的领域设定了简单而坚实的基线。

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is

TL;DR: XMAG是一个轻量级基础模型，通过跨放大倍数蒸馏技术将20x放大倍数的教师模型知识转移到5x放大倍数的学生架构，在保持诊断准确性的同时实现30倍处理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在计算病理学中参数庞大、处理要求高，难以在临床环境中部署。需要开发轻量级模型以支持资源受限的临床环境。

Method: 采用跨放大倍数蒸馏框架，包含双级知识转移（全局图像表示和局部空间token映射对齐），使用紧凑骨干网络在5x放大倍数下运行，训练于349万张图像。

Result: 在六个临床相关组织病理学分析任务中，诊断准确性与大型基础模型相差不到1%，处理速度达到每分钟8.8张全玻片图像，实现30倍加速。

Conclusion: 跨放大倍数蒸馏是部署基础模型能力到资源受限临床环境的可行方法，可能实现实时病理AI集成。

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

*Na Min An,Inha Kang,Minhyun Lee,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch是一个零样本参考图像分割框架，通过利用模型内部组件增强文本和图像的空间表示，无需额外训练即可显著提升空间定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在图像文本对齐方面表现出色，但在理解空间关系方面存在困难。文本流中现有方法通常只关注主要名词短语，忽略了上下文标记；视觉流中CLIP对具有不同空间布局的图像生成相似特征，导致空间结构敏感性有限。

Method: CoPatch通过构建混合文本特征（包含带有空间线索的上下文标记）来增强语言表示；通过从中间层发现的新路径提取补丁级图像特征来增强视觉表示，这些特征融合成聚类图像文本相似度图CoMap，实现精确掩码选择。

Result: CoPatch在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+、RefCOCOg和PhraseCut数据集上显著提升了零样本参考图像分割的空间定位能力（+2-7 mIoU），且无需任何额外训练。

Conclusion: 研究强调了恢复和利用视觉语言模型中固有但未被开发的空间知识的重要性，为零样本参考图像分割开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore
the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge
inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in
zero-shot RIS.

Motivation: 降低乘法运算成本对于在能源受限的边缘设备上高效部署深度神经网络至关重要。

Method: HTMA-Net选择性地将中间卷积层替换为混合哈达玛变换层，其内部卷积通过免乘法内存操作实现。

Result: 在ResNet-18上使用CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet评估，相比基线模型消除了最多52%的乘法，同时保持可比较的精度，显著降低了计算复杂度和参数数量。

Conclusion: 将结构化哈达玛变换层与SRAM内存计算免乘法算子相结合是实现高效深度学习架构的有前景路径。

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

Conclusion: 提出的ChangeVG模型通过视觉引导模块和双粒度感知，在遥感变化理解的多任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在计算效率和保真度之间存在权衡：基于VAE的模型存在信息损失和细节限制，像素空间模型计算成本过高，级联模型无法端到端优化且各阶段分布学习不准确。

Method: 使用条件依赖耦合策略，将生成过程分解为多阶段插值轨迹，整个流程建模为单一统一的扩散Transformer，避免模块分离并支持知识共享。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多个分辨率下同时实现了高保真度和高效率。

Conclusion: 提出的统一多阶段生成框架成功解决了图像生成中计算效率与保真度的权衡问题，通过端到端优化和知识共享实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

Abstract: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is essential for rapid stroke
diagnosis but is limited by low image contrast and signal to noise ratio. We
address this challenge by leveraging DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised
vision transformer, to generate powerful feature representations for a
comprehensive set of stroke analysis tasks. Our evaluation encompasses infarct
and hemorrhage segmentation, anomaly classification (normal vs. stroke and
normal vs. infarct vs. hemorrhage), hemorrhage subtype classification (EDH,
SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH), and dichotomized ASPECTS classification (<=6 vs. >6) on
multiple public and private datasets. This study establishes strong benchmarks
for these tasks and demonstrates the potential of advanced self-supervised
models to improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT, providing a clear
analysis of both the advantages and current constraints of the approach. The

TL;DR: Earth-Agent是首个基于MCP工具生态系统的智能体框架，统一RGB和光谱遥感数据，支持跨模态、多步骤的定量时空推理，超越了预训练MLLMs的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在处理需要多步骤推理和领域特定工具的复杂地球观测任务时存在局限，现有智能体方法仅限于RGB感知、浅层推理且缺乏系统评估协议。

Method: 构建基于MCP工具生态系统的智能体框架，支持动态调用跨模态的专家工具和模型，实现RGB和光谱数据的统一处理。

Result: 实验表明Earth-Agent在不同LLM骨干、通用智能体框架和遥感基准测试中均表现出有效性，建立了地球观测分析的新范式。

Conclusion: Earth-Agent为地球观测领域建立了科学基础扎实的下一代LLM应用范式，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth
observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeatherCycle是一个统一的非配对框架，通过双向退化-内容转换循环解决多天气条件下的图像恢复问题，使用亮度-色度分解策略分离退化与内容，无需建模复杂天气。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多天气图像恢复方法通常依赖特定任务的物理先验，其狭窄的焦点限制了在多样化真实天气场景中的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出WeatherCycle框架，采用亮度-色度分解策略解耦退化与内容；开发亮度退化引导模块(LDGM)从退化图像池学习亮度退化先验；引入难度感知对比正则化(DACR)模块通过CLIP分类器识别困难样本并增强语义一致性。

Result: 在多个多天气数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在无监督方法中达到了最先进的性能，对复杂天气退化具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: WeatherCycle通过创新的分解策略和正则化模块，为多天气图像恢复提供了一个有效且可泛化的无监督解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

TL;DR: Sparse2Dense是一个基于关键点的生成框架，利用极稀疏的3D关键点作为传输符号，实现超低码率人体视频压缩和精确顶点预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决带宽受限多媒体应用中同时实现超低码率人体视频压缩和准确顶点预测的挑战，需要协调动态运动建模、细节外观合成和几何一致性。

Method: 采用多任务学习和关键点感知的深度生成模型，通过紧凑3D关键点编码复杂人体运动，并利用这些稀疏关键点估计密集运动以实现时间一致性和真实纹理的视频合成。集成顶点预测器通过联合优化学习人体顶点几何。

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense有望促进带宽高效的人体中心媒体传输，如实时运动分析、虚拟人动画和沉浸式娱乐。

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Motivation: 准确的车轴计数对交通控制、收费和基础设施发展至关重要，需要克服密集环境中现有方法的局限性。

Method: 使用YOLO-OBB检测分类车辆，YOLO检测轮胎，提出TRAX算法跟踪帧间车轴特征，处理车辆遮挡和部分检测问题。

Result: 显著减少误报，提高长车辆车轴计数准确性，在真实交通视频中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了向可扩展AI驱动车轴计数系统的重要一步，为机器视觉替代传统路边基础设施铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside
infrastructure.

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM是一个轻量级适配框架，通过特征Fisher信息惩罚和置信度错位惩罚来改进SAM模型在医学图像分割中的领域泛化能力和校准性能，仅微调掩码解码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型在自然图像上表现出强大的零样本性能，但在应用于医学体积数据时存在领域偏移和过度自信的问题。

Method: 提出CalSAM框架：(1)通过特征Fisher信息惩罚减少编码器对领域偏移的敏感性；(2)通过置信度错位惩罚惩罚过度自信的体素级错误。仅微调掩码解码器，保持SAM编码器冻结。

Result: 在跨中心和扫描仪偏移评估中，CalSAM显著提高了准确性和校准：在BraTS扫描仪分割上，DSC相对提升7.4%，HD95减少26.9%，ECE减少39.5%；在ATLAS-C上，DSC相对提升5.3%，ECE减少32.6%。

Conclusion: CalSAM为脑MRI分割提供了改进的领域泛化和更好的校准不确定性估计，同时保留了冻结SAM编码器的计算优势。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如UNIT在无监督在线3D实例分割中存在训练多样性有限、时间采样僵化以及对噪声伪标签依赖严重的问题。

Method: 通过合成点云序列生成丰富训练分布，采用灵活采样策略结合相邻和非相邻帧，并使用动态加权损失强调置信样本。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI、nuScenes和PandaSet数据集上持续超越UNIT和其他无监督基线，获得更高的分割精度和更鲁棒的时序关联。

Conclusion: 该方法在无监督在线3D实例分割任务中表现出色，代码将在github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D公开。

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

Motivation: 人脸识别系统面临对抗攻击的安全威胁，但大多数攻击仅限于数字域或需要白盒访问。需要开发在黑盒设置下具有物理可迁移性的攻击方法

Method: 使用查询高效的零阶贪婪算法，通过逐步添加高斯斑点来迭代构建对称灰度模式，仅依赖余弦相似度分数来最大化降低身份识别准确率

Result: 仅需约10,000次查询到黑盒ArcFace模型，GaP在数字和真实世界物理测试中都实现了高攻击成功率，并且成功欺骗了未见过的FaceNet模型

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了人脸识别系统的实际严重漏洞，证明即使对目标系统了解有限，也能构建出鲁棒且可迁移的攻击

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

Abstract: Ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) is a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for
studying speech articulation, motor control, and related disorders. However,
real-time tongue contour segmentation remains challenging due to low

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI)方法，通过渐进式分离重要patch来构建稀疏合成图像，同时让剩余patch继续演化，解决了ViT模型反转计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sparse Model Inversion (SMI)方法过早丢弃看似不重要的patch，但研究发现这些patch最终也能获得可转移知识，丢弃它们会抑制类无关特征的提取。

Method: PRI在反转过程中逐步分离最重要的patch构建稀疏图像，同时允许剩余patch继续演化，实现渐进式稀疏化。

Result: PRI比标准Dense Model Inversion快10倍，比SMI快2倍，在准确率上优于SMI并匹配DMI性能。

Conclusion: PRI通过渐进式patch分离策略有效平衡了类无关和类特定知识，实现了高效且高性能的模型反转。

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，仅使用未标记数据就能有效减少幻觉，同时保持模型性能

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Method: 使用MLLM生成目标物品描述，通过美学链式思维将图像提炼为结构化美学档案（颜色、风格、场合、季节、材质、平衡），利用动态熵门控机制融合视觉摘要、文本描述和美学向量，在共享嵌入空间中排序候选物品。

Conclusion: TATTOO证明了在MLLM时代，传统基于训练的服装搭配推荐流程可以简化为无需训练的模式，同时获得更好的推荐效果和美学感知能力。

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

Conclusion: CoAdaIN方法在RGB到热成像图像转换中实现了更优的一对多映射效果，为ADAS系统提供了更好的热成像数据生成能力。

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper

computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

TL;DR: OracleGS是一个用于稀疏视图新视角合成的框架，通过结合生成模型的完整性和回归模型的几何保真度，使用"提议-验证"机制来解决几何模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图新视角合成存在严重的几何模糊性，现有方法在生成完整性和几何保真度之间存在权衡：回归模型几何忠实但不完整，生成模型能补全场景但常引入结构不一致。

Method: 使用预训练的3D感知扩散模型生成完整场景提议，然后利用多视角立体模型作为3D感知预言机验证生成视图的3D不确定性，通过不确定性加权损失指导3D高斯溅射模型的优化。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360和NeRF Synthetic等数据集上优于现有最先进方法，能够过滤幻觉伪影同时保留在约束不足区域中的合理补全。

Conclusion: OracleGS成功地将强大的生成先验与多视角几何证据相结合，在稀疏视图高斯溅射中实现了生成完整性与回归保真度的调和。

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Motivation: 图像到视频生成模型的快速发展带来了显著风险，使得从静态图像合成视频变得容易，促进了欺骗性或恶意内容的创建。现有的防御方法如I2VGuard试图免疫图像，但有效且原则性的阻止运动的方法仍有待探索。

Method: 提出Vid-Freeze方法，通过添加精心设计的对抗扰动来明确针对I2V模型的注意力机制，完全破坏运动合成，同时保持输入图像的语义保真度。

Result: 实验表明该方法提供了令人印象深刻的保护效果，免疫后的图像生成静止或接近静态的视频，有效阻止恶意内容创建。

Conclusion: 注意力攻击是抵御I2V生成模型滥用的一个稳健且主动的防御方向，具有重要价值。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

Motivation: 传统脉冲相机重建方法在低光照高速场景下难以处理严重的噪声和稀疏信息，需要新的方法来补充纹理信息。

Method: 提出ETFI模块从低光照脉冲流中聚合稀疏信息，作为ControlNet的条件输入生成高速场景图像，并引入ETFI特征融合模块提升生成质量。

Result: 在真实低光照脉冲流上的实验表明Diff-SPK具有优越性能，同时建立了首个低光照脉冲流重建基准数据集。

Conclusion: Diff-SPK通过结合生成先验和脉冲流特征，有效解决了低光照高速场景下的脉冲相机重建问题，为相关研究提供了新思路和基准。

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

Conclusion: BDGF框架通过平衡扩散引导和多分支协作，有效解决了多模态遥感数据分类中的模态不平衡和特征融合问题。

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型看似具备文化能力，但实际上依赖表面模式匹配而非真正的文化理解，需要评估其文化推理能力以确保多模态系统的公平性和可解释性。

Method: 通过分类和解释分析来诊断视觉语言模型对火主题文化图像的推理能力，测试了多个模型在西方节日、非西方传统和紧急场景上的表现。

Result: 模型在识别主流西方节日时表现良好，但在理解代表性不足的文化事件时存在困难，经常提供模糊标签或将紧急情况危险地误分类为庆祝活动。

Conclusion: 这些失败暴露了符号捷径的风险，强调需要在准确度指标之外进行文化评估，以确保多模态系统的可解释性和公平性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Motivation: 现有目标检测方法存在两个主要问题：对未见类别的泛化能力差，以及在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性不足。现有研究分别处理这两个问题，但难以同时实现鲁棒性和多样性。

Method: 采用两阶段课程学习框架：第一阶段使用RGBT数据进行预训练以增强鲁棒性，第二阶段通过视觉-语言对齐提高泛化能力。引入指数移动平均机制防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在FLIR数据集上达到80.1 AP50，在OV-COCO数据集上达到48.6 AP50_Novel，在OV-LVIS数据集上达到35.7 mAPr，在鲁棒性和多样性评估中均表现优异。

Conclusion: C3-OWD框架成功统一了鲁棒性和泛化性的优势，通过理论保证的EMA机制有效防止了灾难性遗忘，在多个数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness
and diversity evaluations. Code available at:

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在扩展推理链时过度依赖文本逻辑，逐渐失去对底层视觉信息的关注，导致推理路径偏离图像内容并产生错误结论。

Method: 采用无需训练的解耦视觉推理流程：强大的LLM负责高层推理编排，策略性地询问LMM以提取所需视觉信息；LMM仅作为视觉问答引擎，按需提供感知细节。

Result: 综合评估表明，该框架能有效控制视觉推理过程，显著减少无视觉依据的推理步骤，大幅提升推理保真度。

Conclusion: 这种轻量级即插即用方法无需额外训练或架构修改，成功解决了LMM在长推理链中视觉信息丢失的问题。

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

TL;DR: 提出了Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP)框架，通过类特定的正负提示词解耦语义，并引入渐进置信度解耦策略来抑制假阳性，解决了多标签类增量学习中的语义混淆和部分标签问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示词的方法在单标签类增量学习中表现良好，但直接扩展到多标签类增量学习(MLCIL)效果不佳，主要面临两个内在挑战：共现类别导致的语义混淆和部分标签引起的真负假正混淆。

Method: DDP框架包含类特定的正负提示词来解耦语义，以及渐进置信度解耦(PCD)策略来抑制假阳性。过去的提示词被冻结作为知识锚点，层间提示提高了效率。

Result: 在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上，DDP持续优于先前方法，是首个在标准MS-COCO B40-C10基准下超过80% mAP和70% F1的无回放MLCIL方法。

Conclusion: DDP框架有效解决了多标签类增量学习中的关键挑战，在多个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能，证明了其在无回放设置下的优越性。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10
benchmark.

Conclusion: LRPO框架成功解决了盲人脸恢复中的大解空间探索问题，在感知质量和保真度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: DentVLM是一个多模态视觉语言模型，专为口腔疾病诊断设计，在36个诊断任务中显著优于现有模型，并在临床研究中表现出色，能提升初级牙医的诊断水平并缩短诊断时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在处理口腔疾病诊断时，难以满足多模态成像和综合信息整合的复杂临床需求，需要开发能够全面解读多种成像模式的专业级诊断工具。

Method: 使用包含110,447张图像和246万视觉问答对的大规模双语数据集开发DentVLM模型，该模型能够解读7种2D口腔成像模式，涵盖36个诊断任务。

Result: DentVLM在口腔疾病诊断准确率上比领先模型高19.6%，在错颌畸形诊断上高27.9%。临床研究中，在36个任务中的21个任务上超越初级牙医，在12个任务上超越高级牙医，并能将初级牙医水平提升至高级水平，诊断时间减少15-22%。

Conclusion: DentVLM是一个强大的临床决策支持工具，有望提升初级牙科护理质量，缓解医患不平衡问题，并在牙科领域普及专业医疗知识。

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary
dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to
specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

TL;DR: Dynamic-TreeRPO通过树状结构采样和LayerTuning-RL范式，在文本到图像生成中实现了高效的强化学习优化，显著提升了生成质量和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的流匹配模型在提升文本到图像生成质量时，面临探索效率低和采样策略不高效的问题，主要由于采样组中微小变化导致的计算开销。

Method: 提出Dynamic-TreeRPO，采用滑动窗口采样策略构建树状结构搜索，在树结构中进行GRPO引导优化和约束SDE采样；同时提出LayerTuning-RL范式，将SFT损失函数重新表述为动态加权的进度奖励模型。

Result: 在HPS-v2.1、PickScore和ImageReward基准测试中，模型分别比现有最佳方法提升了4.9%、5.91%和8.66%，同时训练效率提升了近50%。

Conclusion: 树状结构采样和LayerTuning-RL范式能够动态探索多样化的搜索空间，在语义一致性、视觉保真度和人类偏好对齐方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

*Lin Tian,Xiaoling Hu,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种与任何预训练配准网络兼容的测试时不确定性估计框架，通过分析空间扰动下网络预测的方差来评估配准可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度配准网络缺乏对其预测可靠性的指示，现有不确定性估计方法需要架构更改或重新训练，限制了在预训练网络中的应用。

Method: 基于配准的变换等变性特性，通过空间扰动输入图像并分析网络预测的方差，理论分解扰动不确定性为内在扩散和偏置抖动两个分量。

Result: 在四个解剖结构（脑、心脏、腹部、肺）和多个配准模型上的实验表明，不确定性图与配准误差一致相关，能识别需要谨慎处理的区域。

Conclusion: 该框架可将任何预训练配准网络转变为风险感知工具，推动医学图像配准在临床和大规模研究环境中的安全部署。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAPE是一种即插即用的增强方法，通过将排序信号融入基于LLM的查询重写，解决了CLIP模型在分布偏移场景下的检索性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在大规模检索系统中表现优异，但在输入分布与其训练语料不同的任务中表现不佳，如多语言、长文本或多模态查询。现有方法使用LLM进行查询重写，但缺乏监督信号导致无法生成最优查询。

Method: 提出GRAPE方法，使用GRPO将排序信号融入检索引导的查询重写，通过语料相对排序奖励解决分数膨胀问题，使查询更符合检索器的训练分布。

Result: 在多语言差异(Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600)、长度差异(Wikipedia)和多模态差异(CIRR)等分布偏移场景下，Recall@10平均提升4.9%。

Conclusion: GRAPE能有效提升CLIP模型在分布偏移场景下的检索性能，通过排序感知的策略优化解决了查询重写中的分数膨胀问题。

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasPoinTr是一个新颖的点云补全框架，通过级联网络和知识蒸馏来解决点云不完整问题，在ShapeNet-55数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界收集的点云通常由于传感器分辨率限制、单视角、遮挡和噪声等因素而不完整，这给点云补全任务带来了挑战，特别是从高度不完整的点云预测整体形状和重建缺失区域。

Method: 使用级联网络和知识蒸馏的框架，将补全任务分解为两个协同阶段：形状重建阶段生成辅助信息，融合补全阶段利用这些信息和知识蒸馏生成最终输出。教师模型在更密集的点云上训练，将不完整-完整关联知识传递给学生模型。

Result: 在ShapeNet-55数据集的不同难度设置下，CasPoinTr在形状恢复和细节保留方面优于现有方法，证明了级联结构和蒸馏策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 级联网络和知识蒸馏相结合增强了模型捕捉全局形状上下文和细化局部细节的能力，有效弥合了不完整输入和完整目标之间的差距。

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

*Jinghong Zheng,Changlong Jiang,Jiaqi Li,Haohong Kuang,Hang Xu,Tingbing Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPose是一种统一跨模态姿态先验传播方法，通过自监督学习将2D人体姿态估计标注从大规模RGB数据集迁移到3D领域，无需3D关键点标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D人体姿态估计需要大量3D关键点标注的问题，通过利用易获取的RGB-D序列和现成的2D姿态估计作为弱监督，避免多视角相机标定和合成到真实数据偏移的问题。

Method: 使用现成的2D姿态估计作为点云网络的弱监督，结合空间时间约束（身体对称性和关节运动），通过2D到3D反向投影损失和跨模态交互增强训练。采用锚点到关节预测方法在RGB和深度网络上执行3D提升。

Result: 在CMU Panoptic和ITOP数据集上的实验表明，UniPose达到了与全监督方法相当的性能。结合大规模未标注数据（如NTU RGB+D 60）可提升在挑战性条件下的性能。

Conclusion: UniPose展示了在无需3D标注的情况下实现有效3D人体姿态估计的潜力，其提出的3D提升方法达到了最先进的结果。

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自接触数据集缺乏多样化的自接触姿态和精确体型信息，限制了自接触姿态与体型关系的分析。

Method: 构建包含383K自接触姿态的Goliath-SC数据集，提出基于身体部位潜扩散和自注意力的体型条件自接触先验生成模型，并将其集成到单视角姿态估计中。

Result: 实验表明体型条件对于成功建模自接触姿态分布至关重要，能够显著改进自接触场景下的单视角姿态估计。

Conclusion: 体型条件是建模自接触姿态分布的关键因素，所提出的方法有效提升了自接触场景中的姿态估计性能。

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

Motivation: 现有驾驶场景生成方法主要关注合成多样化高保真驾驶视频，但缺乏3D一致性和稀疏视角覆盖，难以支持高质量新视角合成；而3D/4D重建方法虽改善了新视角合成，但缺乏生成能力。

Method: 采用前馈框架：1) 引入4D感知潜在扩散模型，集成多模态信息生成像素对齐的4D高斯分布；2) 使用增强视频扩散模型对从高斯分布渲染的新视角视频进行细化。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，WorldSplat能够有效生成高保真、时空一致的多视角驾驶视频。

Conclusion: WorldSplat成功解决了场景生成与重建之间的困境，为自动驾驶系统提供了可扩展和可控的训练数据生成能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

Conclusion: Fracture-YOLO通过创新的注意力机制和多尺度处理，显著提升了骨折检测的准确性和效率，为医学影像分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis,
traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced
physicians, however the speed and accuracy of this approach are constrained by
the expertise. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, deep
learning models based on the YOLO framework have been widely employed for
fracture detection, demonstrating significant potential in improving diagnostic
efficiency and accuracy. This study proposes an improved YOLO-based model,
termed Fracture-YOLO, which integrates novel Critical-Region-Selector Attention
(CRSelector) and Scale-Aware (ScA) heads to further enhance detection
performance. Specifically, the CRSelector module utilizes global texture
information to focus on critical features of fracture regions. Meanwhile, the
ScA module dynamically adjusts the weights of features at different scales,
enhancing the model's capacity to identify fracture targets at multiple scales.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline model,
Fracture-YOLO achieves a significant improvement in detection precision, with

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is
proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture
detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical
practice. Despite recent advancements, existing methods still struggle with
detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging
angles and suboptimal image quality. To overcome these limitations, FracDetNet
integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC).
Specifically, the DFA module effectively captures detailed local features and
comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention
mechanisms. Additionally, the MC adaptively refines feature representations to
enhance detection performance. Experimental evaluations on the publicly
available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
FracDetNet achieving a mAP$_{50-95}$ of 40.0\%, reflecting a \textbf{7.5\%}

TL;DR: SPIKE是一个推理时框架，通过量化贝叶斯惊喜来识别视频中的关键时刻，指导帧采样策略，在多个下游基准测试中优于均匀采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频通常包含常规活动和令人难忘的惊喜事件，但现有Video-LLMs通过均匀采样帧可能错过定义视频叙事的关键时刻。

Method: 引入SPIKE框架量化贝叶斯惊喜作为新视觉证据引发的信念更新，识别新证据与先验信念冲突的时刻；开发SPIKE-RL使用GRPO优化基于视频字幕奖励信号的信念假设。

Result: SPIKE能有效定位视频中的惊喜时刻，与人类在正负惊喜基准上高度相关；通过惊喜加权帧采样策略，在五个下游基准测试中持续优于均匀采样。

Conclusion: 通过让Video-LLMs跟踪信念并注册惊喜，为构建更鲁棒的模型铺平道路，使其能够根据新信息修正理解。

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于周期性激活的隐式神经表示网络（如SIREN和FINER）存在隐藏特征冗余问题，由于使用固定频率乘子，同一层内的神经元捕获重叠的频率分量，限制了多层感知器的表达能力。

Method: 受离散正弦变换等经典信号处理方法的启发，为周期性激活函数分配基于奈奎斯特频率的神经元特定频率乘子，在不增加网络深度或需要超参数调优的情况下引入频率多样性。

Result: 该方法将特征冗余减少近50%，在多种INR任务中（包括1D音频、2D图像、3D形状拟合和神经辐射场合成）持续改善信号重建性能，优于基线方法同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 这种简单而原则性的修改有效减少了特征冗余，提升了隐式神经表示网络的表达能力，在各种信号重建任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

Result: 在两个专门评估参考坐标系空间理解的基准测试中，FoR-SALE将最先进T2I模型的性能提升了高达5.3%，仅通过单轮校正实现。

Conclusion: FoR-SALE框架成功地将参考坐标系集成到多模态模型中，显著提升了文本到图像生成的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

*Tharindu Ekanayake,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPCNet是一个紧凑的、与估计器无关的模块，可将单目3D姿态估计器产生的相机中心骨架转换为身体中心的规范坐标系，消除视角依赖性，便于运动分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D姿态估计器产生相机中心的骨架，创建视角依赖的运动信号，这使健康监测和运动科学等应用中的比较分析变得复杂。

Method: 3DPCNet使用混合编码器融合图卷积网络的局部骨骼特征和transformer的全局上下文，通过门控交叉注意力机制预测连续的6D旋转，映射到SO(3)矩阵来对齐姿态。模型在MM-Fi数据集上以自监督方式训练，使用合成旋转的姿态，通过复合损失确保旋转精度和姿态重建。

Result: 在MM-Fi基准测试中，3DPCNet将平均旋转误差从超过20°降低到3.4°，平均每关节位置误差从约64mm降低到47mm。在TotalCapture数据集上的定性评估显示，该方法从视频中产生的加速度信号与地面真实IMU传感器数据具有强视觉对应性。

Conclusion: 3DPCNet能够有效消除视角变异性，实现物理上合理的运动分析，为基于视频的运动监测应用提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一个细粒度的测试时优化框架，通过分解输入提示为语义概念并在全局和概念级别评估对齐，使用细粒度CLIP变体计算概念级对应关系，通过迭代提示优化循环提高文本到图像生成的组合忠实度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在处理复杂提示时经常遗漏或错误表示特定对象和属性，测试时优化是解决这一限制的有前景方法，但现有方法主要依赖全局图像/文本相似度评分。

Method: 将输入提示分解为语义概念，在全局和概念级别评估对齐，使用细粒度CLIP变体计算概念级对应关系，生成关于缺失或不准确概念的详细反馈，通过迭代提示优化循环让大语言模型提出改进的提示。

Result: 在DrawBench和CompBench提示上的实验表明，该方法在概念覆盖率和人类判断的忠实度方面显著优于标准测试时优化和基础文本到图像模型。

Conclusion: 提出的细粒度测试时优化框架有效提高了文本到图像生成的组合忠实度，通过概念级评估和迭代提示优化实现了更好的概念覆盖和生成质量。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

Motivation: 现有的多模态人脸反欺诈方法在检测未见过的目标域攻击时表现不佳，而域自适应方法在多模态场景中尚未被探索。

Method: 通过提取其他模态的互补特征处理模态缺失，利用多模态预测不确定性获取可靠伪标签，设计自适应损失权重机制防止模型退化。

Result: 大量实验证明MFAS-DANet的有效性和最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MFAS-DANet成功解决了多模态人脸反欺诈在域自适应场景下的关键挑战，实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

TL;DR: RestoRect提出了一种新的潜在整流流特征蒸馏方法，通过将特征蒸馏重新表述为生成过程，让学生网络在潜在空间中学习合成教师质量的图像特征，解决了图像恢复中性能与速度的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像恢复方法面临关键权衡：高性能模型太慢不实用，而快速模型效果差。传统知识蒸馏方法无法捕捉现代transformer架构动态生成特征的方式。

Method: 应用整流流将特征蒸馏重新表述为生成过程，结合Retinex理论进行物理分解、可学习各向异性扩散约束和三角色彩空间极化，引入特征层提取损失实现跨架构知识迁移。

Result: 在15个图像恢复数据集、4个任务、8个指标上展示了优越结果，实现了更好的训练稳定性、更快的收敛和推理速度，同时保持恢复质量。

Conclusion: RestoRect通过潜在整流流特征蒸馏有效解决了图像恢复中性能与速度的权衡问题，为实际应用提供了高效高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge
transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized
transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.
RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and
inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results
across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于低秩假设，无法充分建模无约束动态场景中固有的复杂区域特定变形，需要更有效的动态建模方法。

Method: 首先估计全局方向场作为结构指导，然后提出方向感知超高斯表示，将时间、空间、几何和方向嵌入到统一概率状态中，通过条件切片推断区域特定变形。

Result: 实验证明OriGS在具有挑战性的真实世界动态场景中相比主流方法具有更优的重建保真度。

Conclusion: OriGS通过基于方向的表示有效解决了复杂动态场景的4D重建问题，展示了在建模区域特定变形方面的优势。

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

TL;DR: 该论文通过大规模实证研究量化了多模态学习中视觉和文本模态的依赖关系，发现在23个VQA基准测试中，对视觉、文本及其交互的依赖程度差异显著，许多旨在减少文本偏见的基准反而放大了图像依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多模态学习中模态内依赖（单个模态对目标任务的贡献）和模态间依赖（模态与目标任务的关系）的相互作用对于推进多模态学习至关重要，但目前基准评估中这些依赖的性质和交互仍缺乏充分表征。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在23个视觉问答基准上进行大规模实证研究，涵盖通用和专业知识推理、光学字符识别、文档理解等领域，量化视觉、文本及其交互的依赖关系。

Result: 研究发现不同基准测试中对视觉、文本及其交互的依赖程度差异显著，许多旨在缓解文本偏见的基准无意中放大了图像依赖，且这种特征在不同模型规模下持续存在，大模型常利用模态内依赖实现高性能而掩盖多模态推理的不足。

Conclusion: 研究提供了多模态数据集的量化表征，为多模态基准设计和评估提供了原则性方法，揭示了当前基准中存在的依赖不平衡问题。

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

Motivation: 息肉分割在结直肠癌检测中至关重要，但由于息肉形状多样、尺寸不一且边界对比度低，现有方法面临挑战。需要开发更准确高效的分割方法。

Method: 集成动态核机制和全局编码器注意力模块。DK机制通过EA模块的全局上下文向量初始化，在解码阶段迭代优化分割预测；EA模块聚合编码器各层的多尺度信息；解码器采用统一通道适配标准化特征维度。

Result: 在KvasirSEG和CVC ClinicDB基准数据集上超越多个最先进分割方法，获得更高的Dice和IoU分数。UCA简化了解码器结构，降低计算成本而不影响精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为息肉分割提供了稳健且适应性强的解决方案，在临床和自动化诊断系统中具有良好应用前景。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

Method: 创建ActPLD基准测试，评估最先进的专有和开源多模态大语言模型在单人和社交互动点光源显示上的表现。

Result: 所有测试模型在点光源显示的动作理解任务上表现一致较差，揭示了模型在动作和时空理解方面的基本差距。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在从稀疏视觉线索理解人类动作方面存在显著不足，需要进一步改进以更好地模拟人类的具身认知能力。

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps
in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early
detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly

propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for

achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best

drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D实例分割方法需要大量人工标注且词汇表有限，OVSeg3R旨在利用成熟的2D开放词汇模型和3D重建技术，实现无需人工调整的开放词汇3D实例分割。

Method: 1) 利用3D重建模型提供的2D-3D对应关系，将2D实例掩码投影到3D空间生成标注；2) 提出视图实例分割算法避免错误监督；3) 引入2D实例边界感知超点聚类，防止超点跨越实例边界。

Result: 在ScanNet200基准测试中整体性能提升+2.3 mAP，在标准开放词汇设置下，新类别性能比先前方法提升约+7.1 mAP，显著缩小了尾类和头类之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: OVSeg3R成功将最先进的封闭词汇3D实例分割模型扩展到开放词汇，通过利用2D模型和3D重建技术，实现了无需人工标注的高性能3D实例分割。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual
environments.

TL;DR: 首个用于MRI胰腺分区（头、体、尾）分割的联邦学习方法，解决了胰腺疾病区域异质性和数据稀缺问题，在保护隐私的前提下实现了跨机构协作训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺疾病具有显著的区域异质性（癌症多发于头部，慢性胰腺炎导致尾部组织损失），准确分割胰腺区域对精确诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但MRI中由于形态变异、软组织对比度差等问题，该任务极具挑战性。

Method: 提出隐私保护的联邦学习框架，在7个医疗机构间协作训练而不共享数据；系统评估三种分割架构（U-Net、Attention U-Net、Swin UNETR）与两种FL算法（FedAvg、FedProx）的组合；引入基于解剖学知识的损失函数，优先考虑MRI中区域特异性纹理对比。

Result: 使用711个T1W和726个T2W MRI扫描的多样化数据集，发现Attention U-Net与FedAvg组合最适合处理胰腺异质性；方法在分布式异构数据集上实现了临床可行的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了胰腺MRI分割的技术复杂性和数据稀缺问题，为胰腺疾病的精确诊断和治疗规划提供了有效的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了NeuroAdapter框架，直接基于大脑表征条件化潜在扩散模型，无需中间特征空间，提供更好的生成过程透明度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过将脑信号映射到中间图像或文本特征空间来引导生成过程，这掩盖了不同脑区对最终重建输出的贡献

Method: NeuroAdapter视觉解码框架，直接条件化潜在扩散模型于大脑表征，并开发了IBBI双向可解释性框架来分析跨注意力机制

Result: 在公共fMRI数据集上展示了与先前工作相当的视觉重建质量，同时提供了大脑信号如何塑造生成过程的更大透明度

Conclusion: 端到端脑到图像解码具有潜力，并建立了通过视觉神经科学视角解释扩散模型的路径

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

<details>

Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)在图像生成中表现出色，但计算和内存成本高昂。现有量化方法难以应用于DiTs，主要因为激活量化的敏感性和分布复杂性。

Method: 建立强三元权重基线，提出RobustQuantizer实现鲁棒激活量化，利用Hadamard变换将未知分布转换为正态分布，并提出首个仅激活混合精度网络(AMPN)管道。

Result: 在无条件和有条件图像生成任务中，RobuQ框架在亚4位量化配置下实现了最先进的DiT量化性能，首次在ImageNet-1K等大型数据集上实现平均2位激活量化的稳定竞争性图像生成。

Conclusion: RobuQ框架成功解决了DiTs在极低位设置下的量化挑战，为DiTs的实际部署提供了可行的低精度解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

Motivation: 解决当前视频人脸增强方法面临的三个关键挑战：复杂面部纹理建模与时间一致性保持、模型泛化能力受限、推理效率低下。

Method: 基于预训练的WANX视频生成模型，采用单步流匹配范式，结合联合潜在-像素人脸聚焦训练策略，以及MLLM驱动的数据筛选流程。

Result: 在感知质量、身份保持和时间稳定性方面达到最先进水平，同时提供实用的研究资源。

Conclusion: VividFace通过创新的训练策略和高效框架，成功解决了视频人脸增强中的关键挑战，为相关应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

Motivation: 现有基于仿真图像的方法包含大量无关信息（如背景、噪声），影响迁移质量。本文探索使用具有强物理意义和可解释性的FSCM来迁移更纯净的关键目标知识。

Method: 提出MHKT网络，包含：1)任务关联信息选择器(TAIS)分离非信息知识；2)目标通用知识迁移(TGKT)模块使用最大判别散度(MDD)进行分布对齐；3)类别关系知识迁移(CRKT)模块利用类别关系一致性约束解决优化偏差问题。

Result: 在两个由FSCM数据和实测SAR图像组成的新数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过逐步的知识选择和迁移，确保了迁移FSCM知识的完整性，为SAR目标识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

Motivation: 现有的基于Mamba的图像恢复方法受限于固定的扫描模式和低效的特征利用，无法适应不同的退化类型，限制了恢复性能和计算效率。

Method: 提出VAMamba框架：1) QCLAM使用FIFO缓存存储历史表示，通过相似性指导智能融合；2) GPS-SS2D使用Vision Transformer生成得分图估计像素重要性，采用贪心策略确定最优扫描路径。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current
LoRA-adapted and
  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while
effectively controlling
  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.
A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while
maintaining high
  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration
tasks demonstrate
  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

Motivation: 扩散模型在低剂量CT去噪中表现出色，但计算成本极高（单次扫描推理时间超过千秒），严重阻碍了临床采用。需要开发既保持高质量又具有临床可行性的高效方法

Conclusion: 通过弥合高保真度和临床可行性之间的差距，这项工作为医学成像中先进生成模型的实际应用展示了可行路径

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than
representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on
PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical
viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced

Conclusion: VMDiff是一个简单有效的扩散框架，成功解决了多源图像融合中的共存和偏见问题，在艺术创作等领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

Conclusion: FlowLUT成功整合了LUT的高效性、多先验知识和流匹配的优势，实现了高效且高质量的图像增强。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了3D场景中文本控制的可移动物体人机交互生成问题，为更真实的人-场景交互模拟提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a
label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution
for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring,
blood flow modeling, and progression prediction. Code and dataset are

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation

diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

*YuQian Li,Limeng Qiao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RIV模型，通过自省训练和递归推理机制为掩码扩散视觉语言模型添加自我纠错能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的掩码扩散视觉语言模型缺乏自我纠错能力，无法修正生成token中的错误

Method: 1. 自省训练：引入自省模型识别生成序列中的错误；2. 递归推理：通过解掩码→自省→重掩码的循环过程进行迭代修正

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，优于大多数现有MDVLMs

Conclusion: RIV模型成功为掩码扩散视觉语言模型赋予了自我纠错能力，显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

TL;DR: FAMDA是一个多任务无监督域自适应框架，利用视觉基础模型作为教师生成高质量伪标签，通过自训练将泛化能力蒸馏到高效的学生网络中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务密集预测在机器人应用中很重要，但面临域偏移问题。现有的多任务UDA方法主要依赖对抗学习，效果不如自训练技术。

Method: 集成分割和深度基础模型到自训练范式中，为目标准域生成高质量伪标签，将鲁棒泛化能力蒸馏到单一高效学生网络中。

Result: 在标准合成到真实UDA多任务学习基准和新颖的日间到夜间适应任务上达到最先进性能，轻量级版本比基础模型小10倍以上。

Conclusion: FAMDA适合为资源受限的机器人应用创建域自适应和高效的模型。

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating
domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics
applications.

TL;DR: MotionVerse是一个统一框架，利用大语言模型理解和生成单人及多人人体运动，通过运动分词器和延迟并行建模策略实现高效运动表示和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理人体运动时面临模态干扰和计算效率问题，需要统一的框架来同时处理运动理解和生成任务。

Method: 使用残差量化的运动分词器将连续运动序列转换为多流离散token；引入延迟并行建模策略，在时间上错开残差token流的编码；设计双塔架构分离运动和语言模态参数。

Result: 消融研究验证了各组件有效性，广泛实验表明在多种运动相关任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: MotionVerse通过创新的运动表示和建模策略，成功实现了高效的人体运动理解和生成，在多个任务上展现卓越性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

### [121] [LightFair: Towards an Efficient Alternative for Fair T2I Diffusion via Debiasing Pre-trained Text Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23639)
*Boyu Han,Qianqian Xu,Shilong Bao,Zhiyong Yang,Kangli Zi,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightFair提出了一种轻量级方法，通过微调文本编码器的嵌入来解决文本到图像扩散模型中的偏见问题，采用距离约束去偏策略和两阶段采样策略，在保持生成质量的同时显著降低训练负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么需要全参数训练，要么依赖辅助网络进行校正，导致训练或采样负担重且性能不佳。文本编码器作为最可微调的前端模块，其输出在CLIP空间中存在显著偏斜，且噪声预测网络会进一步放大这种不平衡。

Method: 提出协作距离约束去偏策略，通过平衡嵌入距离来改善公平性，无需辅助参考；引入两阶段文本引导采样策略，限制去偏文本编码器的干预时机以保持原始生成质量。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion v1.5上，该方法仅需1/4的训练负担即可实现最先进的去偏效果，采样负担几乎没有增加。

Conclusion: LightFair是一种有效且高效的轻量级方法，能够在保持生成质量的同时显著降低训练负担，实现公平的文本到图像生成。

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的多实例学习方法依赖注意力机制，在处理数十万个补丁时由于二次复杂度需要大量计算资源，存在计算瓶颈问题。

Method: 设计自适应补丁选择器(APS)，用基于RNN的GRU、LSTM和状态空间模型Mamba等高效序列模型替代Transformer中的二次复杂度自注意力机制。

Result: 在TCGA-Lung数据集上，EfficientMIL-Mamba达到AUC 0.976和准确率0.933；在CAMELYON16数据集上，EfficientMIL-GRU达到AUC 0.990和准确率0.975，超越先前最先进方法。

Conclusion: EfficientMIL在显著提高计算效率的同时，在多个组织病理学数据集上优于其他多实例学习方法，且APS在补丁选择上比传统策略更有效。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

TL;DR: 这篇综述系统回顾了自动驾驶中拓扑感知感知的四个核心研究方向：矢量化地图构建、拓扑结构建模、先验知识融合和基于语言模型的感知，揭示了从静态预建地图到动态传感器驱动感知的范式转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态地图构建成本高、难以实时更新且缺乏跨区域泛化能力，限制了自动驾驶系统的可扩展性。需要转向动态的传感器驱动感知方法来实现实时地图构建和拓扑推理。

Method: 通过四个研究方向实现范式转变：紧凑空间建模（矢量化地图构建）、语义关系推理（拓扑结构建模）、鲁棒领域知识集成（先验知识融合）和基于预训练语言模型的多模态场景理解。

Result: 这些方法共同推动了从静态地图到动态感知的转变，使自动驾驶系统能够实时构建地图并进行拓扑推理。

Conclusion: 这些研究方向为构建更具适应性、可扩展性和可解释性的自动驾驶系统铺平了道路，实现了从静态预建地图到动态传感器驱动感知的范式转变。

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的多图像布局控制方法，通过图像而非文本来指定内容，并提供精确的放置指导


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型虽然能生成逼真图像，但文本控制限制了更精确的指导需求。需要同时定义内容和精确位置来实现更精细的控制

Method: 训练免费的方法，每个参考只需要单张图像，提供明确简单的对象和部件级组合控制

Result: 在各种图像组合任务中证明了其有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现多图像布局控制，为图像生成提供了更精确的指导能力

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse-Up是一个内存高效的高保真纹理建模框架，通过稀疏体素引导纹理重建，使用表面锚定和视域分区来突破分辨率限制，在保持几何一致性的同时保留纹理高频细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D资产创建方法存在高频细节丢失问题，要么牺牲跨视图一致性导致纹理撕裂或漂移，要么受限于显式体素的分辨率上限而无法保留精细纹理细节。

Method: 使用稀疏体素指导纹理重建，采用表面锚定（可学习上采样策略将体素约束到网格表面）和视域分区（图像块引导的体素分区方案，仅在可见局部块上监督和反向传播梯度）。

Result: 表面锚定消除了传统体素上采样中70%以上的冗余体素，视域分区显著减少了高分辨率体素训练期间的内存消耗，同时保持了几何一致性和纹理高频细节。

Conclusion: Sparse-Up框架通过稀疏体素、表面锚定和视域分区策略，有效解决了3D纹理建模中的内存效率和高频细节保留问题，实现了高保真纹理重建。

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

Motivation: 解决在挑战性光照条件下对新颖物体进行稳健6D姿态估计的难题，需要在准确初始姿态估计和高效实时跟踪之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用共享的光照不变颜色对特征表示，该特征既用于初始阶段的RGB-D视图与3D网格的鲁棒配准，也用于跟踪阶段的时间对应关系验证，通过轻量级模型回归物体运动。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法既有效又鲁棒，在保持高保真跟踪的同时提供有竞争力的姿态估计精度，即使在突然的姿态变化下也能稳定工作。

Conclusion: 该集成方法通过共享特征表示成功实现了准确初始姿态估计和高效实时跟踪的统一，特别适合边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉编码器输出的视觉令牌数量庞大严重阻碍推理效率，且许多令牌并不重要可以安全剪枝。

Method: 使用视觉编码器中间层的注意力图估计视觉令牌重要性，提出分层剪枝方法：全局保留阶段按区域保留重要令牌，局部保留阶段在窗口内保留最重要令牌。

Result: 将LLaVA-v1.5-7B和LLaVA-Next-7B的首令牌时间分别降低50.0%和55.1%，令牌生成吞吐量分别提高60.9%和47.3%，且准确性未受损甚至在某些基准上有所提升。

Conclusion: HIVTP在保持更好准确性的同时提供更高的推理效率，优于先前工作。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

Motivation: 当前Vision Transformer在手术视频理解中计算成本过高，现有令牌合并方法未能充分考虑视频数据的时空结构和信息分布异质性。

Method: STIM-TM采用解耦策略，分别处理时空维度：时间组件使用显著性权重合并连续帧的空间对应令牌；空间组件通过时间稳定性分析优先合并静态令牌。

Result: 无需训练即可实现显著效率提升，减少65%以上GFLOPs，同时在各种手术视频任务中保持竞争力准确度。

Conclusion: STIM-TM是首个专门针对手术视频理解的令牌合并方法，有效解决了手术应用中的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MSD-KMamba框架，结合双向空间感知和多尺度自蒸馏，解决传统CNN-Transformer混合模型在3D多模态图像分割中的高计算复杂度和全局感知不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN-Transformer混合模型依赖高复杂度的全局注意力机制来捕获长距离依赖关系，导致非线性计算复杂度和显著资源消耗。知识蒸馏和稀疏注意力机制虽然能提高效率，但在复杂任务中往往无法提供足够高的分割精度。平衡模型性能与计算效率仍是关键挑战。

Method: 提出MSD-KMamba框架，包含双向空间感知分支和多尺度自蒸馏融合策略。双向空间感知分支有效捕获脑区域间的长距离空间上下文依赖，并整合强大的非线性特征提取机制。多尺度自蒸馏融合策略增强分层特征表示，改善不同分辨率级别的语义信息传递。

Result: 在多个标准基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MSD-KMamba在分割精度、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面持续优于最先进方法，同时保持高计算效率和良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: MSD-KMamba通过联合利用双向空间感知分支和多尺度自蒸馏融合策略，有效缓解了体积分割中的二次计算复杂度瓶颈，同时解决了全局感知不足的限制，在保持高效率的同时实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly
available at https://github.com/daimao-zhang/MSD-KMamba.

TL;DR: QuantSparse是一个统一框架，将模型量化与注意力稀疏化相结合，显著提升扩散变换器的视频生成效率，在保持高质量的同时大幅减少存储和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在视频生成方面表现出色，但计算和内存成本过高阻碍实际部署。单独使用模型量化或注意力稀疏化在激进压缩下都会导致严重性能下降。

Method: 提出QuantSparse框架，包含多尺度显著注意力蒸馏（提供全局结构指导和局部显著监督）和二阶稀疏注意力重参数化（利用二阶残差的时间稳定性恢复稀疏化丢失的信息）。

Result: 在HunyuanVideo-13B上，QuantSparse达到20.88 PSNR，显著优于最先进的量化基线Q-VDiT（16.85 PSNR），同时存储减少3.68倍，端到端推理加速1.88倍。

Conclusion: QuantSparse成功解决了量化与稀疏化结合时的性能退化问题，为高效视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}
reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end
inference. Our code will be released in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HomeSafeBench基准测试，包含12,900个数据点，涵盖5种常见家庭安全隐患，通过动态第一人称视角图像评估基于视觉语言模型的具身代理在家庭安全检查中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在两个关键局限：1）使用文本描述而非直接视觉信息，无法准确评估基于视觉语言模型的具身代理；2）使用单一静态视角，限制了代理的自由探索，导致某些被遮挡的安全隐患被遗漏。

Method: 创建HomeSafeBench基准测试，提供模拟家庭环境中的动态第一人称视角图像，允许具身代理自由探索房间，获得复杂环境中的多个动态视角。

Result: 对主流视觉语言模型的综合评估显示，即使表现最佳的模型F1分数也仅为10.23%，表明当前模型在识别安全隐患和选择有效探索策略方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench将为未来家庭安全检查相关研究提供有价值的参考和支持，数据集和代码将公开发布。

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用多种骨干网络的SSD模型集成方法，通过加权框融合(WBF)技术提升武器检测的鲁棒性，在复杂场景下相比单一模型获得2.948%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共空间安全需要可靠的武器检测系统，但现有单一模型在遮挡、光照变化和复杂背景等挑战性条件下缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 使用VGG16、ResNet50、EfficientNet和MobileNetV3四种不同骨干网络训练SSD模型，然后采用加权框融合(WBF)方法集成这些模型的预测结果。

Result: 采用'max'置信度评分策略的WBF方法实现了0.838的mAP，相比最佳单一模型相对提升了2.948%，且优于其他融合启发式方法。

Conclusion: 融合策略与模型多样性同等重要，置信度感知融合是提升集成模型准确性的关键机制，为实时武器检测提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作感知系统中频繁交互和实时需求带来的严格带宽限制问题，同时弥补LiDAR聚焦实现中性能不足的缺陷。

Method: 提出INSTINCT框架，包含：1）质量感知过滤机制选择高质量实例特征；2）双分支检测路由分离协作相关和无关实例；3）跨代理本地实例融合模块聚合混合实例特征；4）增强GT采样技术。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和V2V4Real数据集上分别提升精度13.23%和33.08%，同时将通信带宽降低至SOTA方法的1/281和1/264。

Conclusion: INSTINCT在显著降低通信带宽的同时实现了优越的性能，为协作感知系统提供了高效的实例级交互解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然通过处理对象效果（如阴影和反射）提升了对象移除和插入的性能，但在统一模型中应用分类器无引导来处理对象效果的性能影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 在单个模型中联合训练移除和插入的任务嵌入，并在分类器无引导方案中利用这些嵌入；将两个任务提示扩展到空间不同区域，实现在单个去噪步骤中进行对象移动。

Result: 广泛实验表明，CrimEdit实现了卓越的对象移除、可控效果插入和高效对象移动，无需额外训练或单独的移除和插入阶段。

Conclusion: CrimEdit通过联合训练任务嵌入和分类器无引导技术，在统一模型中有效处理对象移除、插入和移动任务，提高了复合编辑的效率。

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

Motivation: 帕金森病诊断流程复杂，严重依赖神经科医生经验，导致早期检测延迟和及时干预机会错失。需要自动化诊断方法来改善这一问题。

Method: 提出PD-Diag-Net框架，包含MRI预处理模块、脑区相关性先验知识、脑区衰老先验知识，以及基于这些先验设计的特征聚合模块和诊断模块。

Conclusion: PD-Diag-Net通过整合临床先验知识和脑年龄差距约束，实现了高效准确的帕金森病自动化诊断，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

Motivation: 潜在扩散模型在低层视觉任务中表现出色，但由于点云的无结构和不规则特性，其在点云补全中的应用尚未充分探索。本文旨在利用扩散模型的强大生成能力来解决点云补全问题。

Method: 1. 将无序的部分点云投影为结构化深度图像，作为DepthLDM的条件来合成多视角深度图像，形成粗糙点云；2. 设计点去噪网络去除粗糙点云中的异常值；3. 设计关联感知点上采样器，利用输入点云与粗糙点之间的局部关联特征进行上采样。

Conclusion: DiffPCN通过结合扩散模型的生成能力和专门设计的点云处理模块，成功解决了点云补全中的挑战，为高质量点云生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: M3DLayout可作为推动文本驱动3D场景合成研究的有价值资源，其丰富的小物体信息支持生成更复杂详细的室内布局。

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了LUQ（Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization）方法，针对多模态大语言模型进行超低比特量化，通过层级选择性量化策略，在保持性能的同时显著减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型部署需要大量内存和计算资源，虽然后训练量化在纯语言模型中已成功压缩到1比特，但在多模态模型中的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出LUQ方法：分析发现多模态token的激活分布在不同层间差异显著，某些层对超低比特量化更具容忍性；采用层级选择性超低比特量化策略，并使用混合多模态token进行后训练量化。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5和Qwen-2.5-VL模型上评估，LUQ模型比4位量化模型分别减少40%和31%内存使用，在MME基准测试中性能下降小于10%。

Conclusion: LUQ方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型的超低比特量化挑战，通过层级选择性量化策略实现了内存效率的显著提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

### [144] [HieraTok: Multi-Scale Visual Tokenizer Improves Image Reconstruction and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23736)
*Cong Chen,Ziyuan Huang,Cheng Zou,Muzhi Zhu,Kaixiang Ji,Jiajia Liu,Jingdong Chen,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraTok是一个基于多尺度Vision Transformer的视觉分词器，通过多尺度下采样和尺度因果注意力机制，在图像重建和生成任务中显著优于单尺度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统单尺度表示建模的局限性，实现从低分辨率全局语义特征到高分辨率结构细节的渐进信息流动。

Method: 采用多尺度下采样生成多尺度token序列，结合尺度因果注意力机制实现信息从粗到细的渐进传播。

Result: 相比单尺度方法，rFID提升27.2%(1.47→1.07)，下游生成任务收敛速度加快1.38倍，gFID提升18.9%(16.4→13.3)，最佳rFID达0.45，gFID达1.82。

Conclusion: 首次提出多尺度ViT分词器，为视觉生成任务中的ViT分词器设计提供了新的思路和方向。

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

TL;DR: GRS-SLAM3R是一个基于DUSt3R的端到端SLAM框架，通过空间记忆和全局一致性改进实现稠密场景重建和位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DUSt3R方法仅使用图像对估计点云图，忽略了空间记忆和全局一致性，导致重建效果受限。

Method: 采用序列化输入，使用基于transformer的门控更新模块维护空间记忆，通过子图划分和局部对齐实现全局一致性映射。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，该框架实现了优越的重建精度，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: GRS-SLAM3R通过空间记忆和全局一致性机制，显著提升了稠密SLAM的重建质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

TL;DR: 提出ResAD++框架解决类别无关异常检测问题，通过残差特征和特征超球约束实现特征解相关，在多个真实数据集上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单类别和多类别异常检测方法在新类别上性能不佳，主要原因是特征表示学习仍然与类别相关（特征相关性）。需要开发能够泛化到不同领域新类别的类别无关异常检测模型。

Method: 1. 提出残差特征：通过匹配并减去正常参考特征来学习残差特征分布而非初始特征分布；2. 特征超球约束：将初始正常残差特征约束到空间超球中，使不同类别的特征尺度尽可能一致；3. 对数障碍双向收缩OCC损失和基于向量量化的特征分布匹配模块。

Result: 在8个真实世界异常检测数据集上的综合实验表明，ResAD++在新类别上直接使用时能取得显著的异常检测结果，优于最先进的竞争方法，也超越了基础版ResAD。

Conclusion: ResAD++通过残差特征学习和特征尺度一致性约束，有效解决了类别无关异常检测中的特征相关性问题，实现了对新类别的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at
https://github.com/xcyao00/ResAD.

TL;DR: 提出了Poivre方法，通过自我精炼过程（先标记点，再可视化，最后迭代精炼）来提升视觉语言模型在视觉指向任务中的性能，使用强化学习训练，在Point-Bench上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在视觉指向任务中表现远低于人类水平，主要限制是模型需要单步完成任务，类似于要求人类不看手指直接指向物体。

Method: 提出Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre)自我精炼过程，使用强化学习训练模型先标记估计点，然后迭代精炼坐标，设计了有效的过程奖励机制。

Result: Poivre-7B模型在Point-Bench上创下新纪录，超越Gemini-2.5-Pro和Molmo-72B等模型超过3%。

Conclusion: 自我精炼过程能有效提升视觉指向性能，强化学习训练的方法具有良好效果，为未来研究提供了代码、数据集和模型检查点。

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's
capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在统一多模态生成方面具有巨大潜力，UniAlignment框架为解决多模态语义理解问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenView++ 是一个统一的对比学习框架，通过多源自适应视图生成和质量驱动的对比学习机制，解决了正样本对构建质量差和学习过程缺乏质量评估的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对比学习方法在正样本对构建方面存在多样性不足和语义损坏风险，在学习过程中缺乏质量评估机制导致所有样本对被同等对待，造成次优监督。

Method: 1. 多源自适应视图生成：通过动态调节图像条件、文本条件和图像-文本条件策略的生成参数，合成多样且语义一致的视图。2. 质量驱动的对比学习：评估每个样本对的语义对齐度和多样性，动态重新加权其训练贡献，优先处理高质量样本对，抑制冗余或不对齐的样本对。

Result: 在视觉表示学习方面，将MoCov2在ImageNet线性分类上的性能提升+2.5%；在视觉-语言学习方面，在十个数据集上的平均零样本分类准确率比CLIP提高+12.31%，比SLIP提高+5.31%，Flickr30k文本检索R@5提升+3.2%。

Conclusion: GenView++通过协同创新的视图生成和质量评估机制，显著提升了对比学习在视觉和视觉-语言任务中的性能，证明了高质量正样本对构建和差异化学习的重要性。

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在处理多模态城市数据时存在两个主要问题：(1)对所有模态使用相同的图神经网络架构，无法捕捉模态特定结构；(2)融合阶段忽视空间异质性，假设不同模态的聚合权重在所有区域保持不变。

Method: 1. 将模态分为聚合级和点级两类，分别使用混合专家GNN和双级GNN处理；2. 设计空间感知多模态融合机制动态推断区域特定融合权重；3. 采用联合对比学习策略整合三个级别的目标。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上，涵盖六种模态和三个任务，MTGRR始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: MTGRR通过模态定制图建模和空间感知融合机制，有效解决了多模态城市区域表示学习中的关键挑战，显著提升了表示质量。

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有VQ方法在视觉先验建模中存在两个问题：1）VQ编码导致大的量化误差；2）使用代码级监督训练预测器无法考虑最终重建误差，导致先验建模精度次优。

Method: 1）纹理向量量化：利用超分辨率任务特性，仅对缺失纹理引入码本建模先验；2）重建感知预测：使用直通估计器直接以图像级监督训练索引预测器。

Conclusion: 通过纹理向量量化和重建感知预测策略，有效解决了VQ方法在视觉先验建模中的量化误差和训练监督问题，实现了高质量的超分辨率重建。

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型参数高效微调方法容易受到微调数据中子群不平衡导致的虚假相关性的影响，这限制了模型的群体鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Group Context Optimization (GroupCoOp)算法，使用组特定文本提示作为群体代表，为每个目标类构建多个分类器。利用VLM文本编码器的丰富语义知识，即使对于训练样本较少的群体也能发现有效的组提示。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五种CLIP架构上取得了最佳结果，有时甚至优于完全微调整个网络的方法，同时仅训练了网络参数的0.016%。

Conclusion: GroupCoOp是一种简单有效的去偏微调算法，能够显著提升微调后视觉语言模型的群体鲁棒性，且参数效率极高。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of

creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric

for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry

the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate

*Efthymios Tsaprazlis,Tiantian Feng,Anil Ramakrishna,Rahul Gupta,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个视觉隐私分类法，并评估了最先进的视觉语言模型在理解上下文隐私方面的能力，发现存在显著不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在推理和理解方面表现出色，但在隐私概念理解方面存在关键限制，需要测试这些模型是否能够理解和执行隐私原则。

Method: 引入了一个全面的、多层次的视觉隐私分类法，并评估了几个最先进的视觉语言模型在理解上下文隐私方面的能力。

Result: 评估揭示了这些模型在理解上下文隐私方面存在显著的不一致性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来研究提供了基础分类法，并对当前模型局限性进行了关键基准测试，证明了迫切需要更强大、隐私意识更强的人工智能系统。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

*Hanyu Zhou,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni4D-LLM是首个统一的4D视觉语言模型框架，通过共享表示和架构设计，在单个Transformer框架中同时实现4D场景理解和生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D和4D方法通常将场景几何分别嵌入自回归模型（语义理解）和扩散模型（内容生成），这种范式差距阻碍了单一模型同时处理理解和生成任务，特别是在需要时空建模的动态4D场景中。

Method: 1）使用共享表示：提取语义特征和噪声注入的外观特征，结合4D几何线索，通过自适应交叉注意力融合为时空感知的视觉表示；2）使用共享架构：基于Transformer骨干网络，将自回归和扩散集成到单一LLM中，配备任务特定头部。通过指令微调提高跨任务泛化能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，Uni4D-LLM相比最先进模型取得了竞争性或更优的结果，并首次真正实现了4D场景理解和生成的统一。

Conclusion: Uni4D-LLM通过统一的视觉语言表示和架构设计，成功实现了4D场景理解和生成任务的统一，为物理世界的视觉语言建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

*Zhixiong Zhang,Shuangrui Ding,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了Segment Concept (SeC)框架在MOSEv2数据集上的零样本性能，该框架利用大型视觉语言模型建立目标对象的深度语义理解，在复杂视频对象分割挑战中获得第二名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的半监督视频对象分割方法主要依赖外观模式匹配，在面临剧烈视觉变化、遮挡和场景转换等挑战时鲁棒性有限，缺乏对目标对象的高层次概念理解。

Method: 使用Segment Concept (SeC)框架，该框架利用大型视觉语言模型建立目标对象的深度语义理解，实现更持久的视频分割。

Result: 在未对训练集进行微调的情况下，SeC在MOSEv2测试集上获得了39.7的JFn分数，在第七届大规模视频对象分割挑战的复杂VOS赛道中排名第二。

Conclusion: SeC框架通过引入大型视觉语言模型提供的语义理解能力，显著提升了半监督视频对象分割在复杂场景下的零样本性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

*Bingyang Cui,Yujie Zhang,Qi Yang,Zhu Li,Yiling Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了T23D-CompBench基准和Rank2Score评估器，用于解决文本到3D生成模型的质量评估问题。通过定义5个组件12个子组件的组合提示词，生成了3600个纹理网格，并收集了129,600个人类评分。Rank2Score采用两阶段训练方法，显著提升了评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到3D质量评估存在基准过时、碎片化、粒度粗糙的问题，且现有客观指标存在设计限制，导致特征提取不具代表性、鲁棒性差。

Method: 1) 构建T23D-CompBench基准，定义组合提示词组件并生成大量3D资产；2) 进行大规模主观实验收集人类评分；3) 提出Rank2Score评估器，采用两阶段训练：第一阶段通过监督对比回归和课程学习增强成对训练，第二阶段使用平均意见分数优化预测。

Result: Rank2Score在多个维度上持续优于现有指标，并可作为奖励函数优化生成模型。实验证明其与人类判断更加一致。

Conclusion: T23D-CompBench为组合式文本到3D生成提供了全面基准，Rank2Score通过创新的两阶段训练方法有效解决了质量评估问题，在多个应用场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于概念的解释方法CE-FAM，通过融合激活映射来同时揭示图像分类器学习的概念、相关区域及其对预测的贡献，无需标注数据集即可处理任意概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时揭示图像分类器学习的概念、相关区域及其对预测的贡献，需要一种能够提供全面概念解释的方法。

Method: 使用分支网络共享图像分类器的激活映射，学习模仿视觉语言模型的嵌入，通过概念预测分数的梯度加权激活映射来表示概念区域，并量化其对分类得分的贡献。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明该方法优于现有方法，在未见概念的零样本推理方面表现出色。

Conclusion: CE-FAM提供了一个通用框架，能够识别概念区域及其贡献，同时利用VLM知识处理任意概念，无需标注数据集。

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairViT-GAN是一个混合框架，结合CNN和ViT来提升面部美观预测的准确性和公平性，通过对抗性去偏机制减少算法偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部美观预测模型存在架构限制、人口统计偏见和缺乏透明度的问题，CNN擅长局部纹理但忽略全局和谐，ViT能建模长距离依赖但忽略细节，且模型会学习社会偏见。

Method: 提出FairViT-GAN混合框架，集成CNN分支提取局部特征和ViT分支建模全局上下文，引入对抗性去偏机制使特征提取器产生对受保护属性不变的表示。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准测试中，FairViT-GAN达到皮尔逊相关系数0.9230和RMSE 0.2650的新SOTA，公平性方面种族亚组间性能差距减少82.9%，对抗者分类准确率降至52.1%。

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN为开发负责任的主观视觉评估AI系统提供了强大、透明且更公平的蓝图。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

TL;DR: 本文提出Sim-DETR，通过限制自注意力机制和添加查询-帧对齐来解决DETR在时序语句定位任务中的查询冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现典型的DETR增强策略在时序语句定位任务中不仅没有提升性能，反而可能降低性能，需要分析根本原因并解决查询冲突问题。

Method: 在标准DETR解码器层中引入两个小修改：(1)基于语义和位置重叠约束查询间的自注意力；(2)添加查询-帧对齐来桥接全局和局部上下文。

Result: Sim-DETR释放了DETR在时序语句定位任务中的全部潜力，为未来研究提供了强大的基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过解决查询冲突问题，Sim-DETR成功提升了DETR在时序语句定位任务中的性能，证明了所提出方法的有效性。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出信息接地引导（IGG）机制，通过注意力机制将引导信号锚定到语义重要区域，解决自回归模型中因渐进分辨率缩放导致的信息不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中面临关键弱点：渐进分辨率缩放引入的跨时间步patch间信息不一致，导致引导信号分散并偏离条件信息，产生模糊不忠实的特征。

Method: 开发信息接地引导（IGG）机制，通过注意力自适应地强化采样过程中的信息丰富patch，确保引导与内容保持紧密对齐。

Result: 在类别条件和文本到图像生成任务中，IGG能够生成更清晰、更连贯且语义接地的图像，为基于AR的方法设定了新基准。

Conclusion: IGG机制有效解决了自回归模型中的信息不一致问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量和语义忠实度。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标无法捕捉MLLMs对无关或分散视觉上下文的敏感性，这影响了模型在真实场景中的可靠性。

Method: 引入PCRI指标，通过比较局部图像块和完整图像输入的性能变化来量化模型鲁棒性，并在19个最先进MLLMs和15个视觉语言基准上进行评估。

Result: 大多数领先模型对背景噪声脆弱，只有InternVL2-26B和Qwen2VL-72B等少数模型在不同任务中表现出一致的鲁棒性。PCRI分析揭示了不同模型架构处理视觉上下文的方式。

Conclusion: PCRI能够严格比较上下文鲁棒性，支持有原则的模型选择，并指导未来架构和训练策略的开发，以实现稳健的真实世界部署。

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 提出的可学习伪标签模块能够自动自适应地选择高质量伪标签，结合软监督策略有效提升了半监督3D目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有低剂量CT去噪方法依赖配对数据、泛化能力差的问题，特别是扩散模型需要学习干净数据分布，这在医疗临床应用中难以满足。

Method: 采用双域策略：首先在投影域设计上下文子数据相似性自适应感知策略，然后结合知识蒸馏与潜在扩散模型优化图像细节，最后使用像素级自校正融合技术增强图像保真度。

Result: 在数据集和真实数据上的定性和定量评估表明，SuperDiff在重建和泛化性能方面始终优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SuperDiff仅需低剂量CT投影域数据即可训练和测试，实现了无需配对数据的自监督低剂量CT去噪，具有良好的重建质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

*Tatsuro Banno,Takehiko Ohkawa,Ruicong Liu,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AssemblyHands-X，首个无标记的3D手部-身体基准数据集，用于研究双手活动中手部-身体协调对动作识别的影响。实验表明基于姿态的动作推理比视频基线更高效准确，且联合建模手部和身体线索能提升识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双手活动天然涉及双手和身体的协调运动，但由于缺乏合适的数据集，这种协调对活动理解的影响尚未得到系统评估。现有3D活动数据集通常只标注手部或身体姿态，而基于标记的运动捕捉方法会引入视觉伪影。

Method: 构建了从同步多视角视频进行3D姿态标注的流程，结合多视角三角测量和SMPL-X网格拟合，实现手部和上半身的可靠3D配准。验证了不同输入表示（视频、手部姿态、身体姿态或手部-身体姿态）在图卷积或时空注意力模型上的效果。

Result: 基于姿态的动作推理比视频基线更高效和准确。联合建模手部和身体线索相比单独使用手部或上半身能改善动作识别性能，突显了建模相互依赖的手部-身体动态对于整体理解双手活动的重要性。

Conclusion: 建模手部-身体协调对于双手活动的整体理解至关重要，AssemblyHands-X数据集为研究这种协调效应提供了重要基准，证明了姿态信息在动作识别中的优越性。

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at eval- uating plant

contributors. This overview presents more precisely the resources and
assessments of the challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by

### [170] [Preserving Cross-Modal Stability for Visual Unlearning in Multimodal Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23895)
*Jinghan Xu Yuyang Zhang Qixuan Cai Jiancheng Chen Keqiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出跨模态对比遗忘(CCU)框架，通过选择性视觉遗忘、跨模态知识保留和双集对比分离，解决多模态应用中视觉模态隐私泄露问题，在保持其他模态性能的同时实现高效视觉遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态应用(如自动驾驶)中，视觉模态最容易泄露隐私，现有机器遗忘方法在视觉遗忘时会破坏跨模态知识并降低其他模态性能。

Method: CCU框架包含三个关键组件：选择性视觉遗忘(使用反向对比学习分离视觉表示与原始语义)、跨模态知识保留(通过语义一致性保持其他模态判别能力)、双集对比分离(隔离遗忘集和保留集的结构扰动)。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，CCU方法相比最佳基线实现了7.12%的准确率提升，且仅需7%的遗忘时间。

Conclusion: CCU框架有效解决了多模态视觉遗忘中的跨模态知识保留和结构稳定性问题，在保持模型整体性能的同时实现了高效的隐私保护。

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

*Rakesh Thakur,Yusra Tariq,Rakesh Chandra Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Q-FSRU模型，结合频率谱表示融合和量子检索增强生成技术，用于医疗视觉问答任务，在VQA-RAD数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决需要同时理解图像和文本的临床难题是医疗AI的主要挑战，现有方法在处理复杂图像文本推理时仍有局限。

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换将医学图像和文本特征转换到频域，结合量子检索系统从外部源获取医学知识，通过量子相似度技术融合频域特征进行推理。

Result: 在VQA-RAD数据集上的评估显示，Q-FSRU在需要图像文本推理的复杂病例上表现优于早期模型。

Conclusion: 频率和量子信息的结合提高了性能和可解释性，为构建智能、清晰、有用的医生AI工具提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

Abstract: The LifeCLEFs plant identification task provides a testbed for a
system-oriented evaluation of plant identification about 500 species trees and
herbaceous plants. Seven types of image content are considered: scan and
scan-like pictures of leaf, and 6 kinds of detailed views with un- constrained
conditions, directly photographed on the plant: flower, fruit, stem & bark,
branch, leaf and entire view. The main originality of this data is that it was
specifically built through a citizen sciences initiative conducted by Tela
Botanica, a French social network of amateur and expert botanists. This makes
the task closer to the conditions of a real- world application. This overview
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of task, summarizes the
retrieval approaches employed by the participating groups, and provides an
analysis of the main eval- uation results. With a total of ten groups from six
countries and with a total of twenty seven submitted runs, involving distinct
and original methods, this fourth year task confirms Image & Multimedia
Retrieval community interest for biodiversity and botany, and highlights
further challenging studies in plant identification.

*Anoushka Harit,William Prew,Zhongtian Sun,Florian Markowetz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合类别条件扩散回放和弹性权重巩固的持续学习框架，用于医学影像基础模型的隐私保护持续适应，无需存储患者样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像基础模型需要持续适应新数据，但完全重新训练受到隐私约束和成本的限制，需要一种不存储患者样本的持续学习方法。

Method: 使用紧凑Vision Transformer骨干网络，结合类别条件扩散回放生成伪样本和弹性权重巩固来防止灾难性遗忘，在MedMNIST v2和CheXpert数据集上评估。

Result: 在CheXpert上达到0.851 AUROC，相比DER++减少超过30%的遗忘，接近联合训练的0.869 AUROC，同时保持高效和隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床影像模型的可扩展、隐私感知持续适应提供了一条实用路径，分析显示遗忘与回放保真度和Fisher加权参数漂移相关。

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,
privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

TL;DR: 提出FedDA框架解决联邦学习中跨域医学图像分割问题，通过特征级对抗学习对齐不同客户端的特征图，提升模型在多域的泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域联邦学习中，不同客户端可能拥有不同模态的医学图像，这种异质性给跨域医学图像分割带来挑战

Method: 提出联邦域适应分割训练框架，通过嵌入对抗训练机制在客户端间进行特征级对抗学习，对齐跨客户端的特征图

Result: 在三个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，FedDA实现了跨域联邦聚合，赋予单模态客户端跨模态处理能力，在客观和主观评估中均优于现有联邦聚合算法

Conclusion: FedDA框架能有效解决联邦学习中跨域医学图像分割的挑战，提升模型在多域上的泛化性能

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EditScore奖励模型系列和EditReward-Bench基准，通过高质量奖励信号解锁图像编辑中的强化学习应用，显著提升指令引导图像编辑性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令引导图像编辑模型在处理复杂指令时仍面临挑战，需要多次尝试才能获得理想结果。强化学习是潜在解决方案，但缺乏高质量、高效的奖励信号阻碍了其在图像编辑领域的应用。

Method: 1) 开发EditReward-Bench基准系统评估奖励模型；2) 构建EditScore系列奖励模型(7B-72B)；3) 通过精心数据筛选匹配专有VLM性能；4) 采用针对生成特性的自集成策略；5) 将高质量奖励模型应用于在线强化学习训练。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了从基准测试到奖励建模再到强化学习训练的系统路径，证明高质量、领域专业化的奖励模型是解锁强化学习在图像编辑领域全部潜力的关键。

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

TL;DR: 提出MoReact模型，通过扩散方法分离生成全局轨迹和局部动作，实现基于文本描述的人类反应生成，解决了现有方法在适应性响应方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么将多人视为单一实体直接生成交互，要么仅依赖单方动作生成反应，缺乏对丰富语义信息的整合，在适应性响应方面存在局限。

Method: 采用扩散模型，顺序解耦全局轨迹和局部动作的生成，先生成全局轨迹指导局部动作，并引入交互损失函数增强近距离交互的真实性。

Conclusion: MoReact方法在文本驱动的人类反应生成任务中表现出色，能够产生语义上符合描述交互场景的逼真动作序列。

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

TL;DR: 本文通过系统实验分析多任务学习中的优化不平衡问题，发现任务特定梯度范数与优化不平衡强相关，并提出基于梯度范数缩放任务损失的简单策略，能达到与昂贵网格搜索相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习(MTL)旨在通过单一网络同时执行多个任务来构建通用视觉系统，但其潜力常因任务干扰导致的优化不平衡问题而受限，需要系统分析该问题的根源。

Method: 进行系统的实验分析，研究现有优化方法在不同数据集上的表现差异，分析视觉基础模型(VFMs)的作用，并探索梯度范数与优化不平衡的关系，提出基于梯度范数缩放任务损失的策略。

Result: 发现现有优化方法在不同数据集上表现不一致，高级架构仍需昂贵的网格搜索损失权重；视觉基础模型虽提供强初始化但无法解决优化不平衡；增加数据量收益有限；任务特定梯度范数与优化不平衡强相关。

Conclusion: 理解和控制梯度动态是解决多任务学习优化不平衡问题的更直接路径，基于梯度范数缩放任务损失的简单策略能达到与复杂方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

*Kuanrong Liu,Siyuan Liang,Cheng Qian,Ming Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了CLIP模型在多任务下的对抗样本迁移行为，发现细粒度任务生成的对抗样本具有更强的跨任务迁移能力，并提出了MT-AdvCLIP框架来增强对抗攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP作为通用视觉语言预训练模型在粗粒度任务上表现良好，但在细粒度任务上表现不佳，且其对抗鲁棒性研究不足。理解对抗样本在任务间的迁移行为对评估CLIP的泛化极限和安全风险至关重要。

Method: 提出了MT-AdvCLIP框架，引入任务感知特征聚合损失，生成具有增强跨任务泛化能力的扰动，强化细粒度任务模型对共享CLIP骨干网络的攻击效果。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，MT-AdvCLIP显著提高了对抗迁移成功率（多任务平均攻击成功率提升超过39%），且不增加扰动预算。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了多任务CLIP模型中对抗样本的迁移机制，为多任务鲁棒性评估和对抗样本设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在文本引导图像修复中难以同时保证文本对齐和背景一致性的问题，探索掩码自回归模型在此任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用掩码自回归模型，提出双流编码器信息融合在频域融合文本和背景信息生成引导令牌，以及自适应解码器注意力增强机制来提升文本对齐和视觉质量。

Result: 在几乎所有指标上都优于现有最先进方法，提供更优的视觉结果。

Conclusion: Token Painter方法有效解决了文本引导图像修复中的文本对齐和背景一致性挑战，展示了掩码自回归模型在此任务中的优势。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

Conclusion: 该框架通过将真实世界驾驶场景紧密集成到模拟器中，解决了现有基准测试的局限性，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的评估方法。

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从深度视觉网络中恢复编码-解码方向对的新方法，这些方向对代表概念嵌入，能够解释网络内部表示并实现模型调试和修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络的黑盒特性阻碍了理解、调试和改进模型。虽然概念在潜在空间中表示为方向，但这些编码-解码方向对无法直接访问，恢复它们有助于打开深度网络的黑箱。

Method: 通过方向聚类识别解码方向，在概率视角下用信号向量估计编码方向，并利用网络权重通过不确定性区域对齐技术揭示影响预测的可解释方向。

Result: 在合成数据上恢复了真实方向对；在真实数据上解码方向映射到单语义可解释概念且优于无监督基线；信号向量能忠实估计编码方向。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效恢复深度网络中的概念表示方向，为理解模型全局行为、解释个体预测以及通过干预产生反事实或修正错误提供了应用可能。

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoPrune是一种训练免费、即插即用的视觉token剪枝框架，通过量化视觉和文本token之间的互信息，生成适应不同样本和任务复杂度的剪枝策略，在LLaVA-1.5-7B上能剪除89%视觉token，减少76.8%推理FLOPs，同时保持96.7%原始精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在视觉token冗余，但传统剪枝方法采用固定的层特定剪枝策略，无法根据输入样本和任务复杂度自适应调整，不符合模型整体推理轨迹。认知科学研究表明人类视觉处理从广泛探索到聚焦的过程，模型中也存在类似模式。

Method: AutoPrune量化视觉和文本token之间的互信息，将其投影到预算约束的逻辑保留曲线。每个逻辑曲线对应特定任务复杂度，确保满足预定义计算约束。该方法无需训练，可直接应用于现有模型。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上，剪除89%视觉token，减少76.8%推理FLOPs，保持96.7%原始精度，相比PDrop方法提升9.1%。在视觉语言任务和自动驾驶视觉语言动作模型上均表现优异。

Conclusion: AutoPrune通过复杂度自适应剪枝策略，有效解决了传统固定剪枝方法的局限性，在保持模型性能的同时显著降低计算需求，为大规模视觉语言模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯溅射的自动汽车损伤检测流水线，通过从2D掩码上采样实现3D损伤分割，并引入无需学习的单视图3D-GS分割方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有汽车损伤检测方法大多基于2D图像分析，而3D重建方法能提供更全面和几何精确的损伤表示。3D高斯溅射技术能从有限视角生成准确连贯的3D重建。

Method: 使用结构从运动获取相机参数，将高斯投影到图像平面，通过Z缓冲和深度、不透明度的正态分布模型进行过滤，实现单视图3D-GS分割。

Result: 该方法在具有挑战性的汽车损伤检测场景中特别有效，尤其是当目标物体（如划痕、小凹痕）仅在单个视图中清晰可见时。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为单视图3D分割提供了简单有效的解决方案，特别适用于多视图一致性方法不切实际或不可能的汽车损伤检测场景。

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial
progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data
generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a
Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the
semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large
language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a
module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in
the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal
Reasoning, enriching the dataset with diverse and challenging samples that
better reflect real-world reasoning demands.

TL;DR: 提出了RLIR（基于逆奖励的强化学习）框架，通过逆动力学模型从生成视频中恢复输入动作，为视频世界模型提供可验证的奖励信号，从而提升动作跟随能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频世界模型在视觉质量和时间一致性方面有所改进，但在准确建模人类指定动作方面能力不足，且传统强化学习后训练方法因大规模偏好标注成本高和基于规则的视频验证器不可行而难以应用。

Method: 使用逆动力学模型将高维视频模态映射到低维动作空间，通过恢复输入动作来获得可验证的奖励信号，并采用组相对策略优化进行优化。

Result: 在自回归和扩散范式下，动作跟随能力提升5-10%，视觉质量提升高达10%，并获得更高的人类偏好评分。

Conclusion: RLIR是首个专门设计用于增强视频世界模型动作跟随能力的后训练方法，有效解决了动作建模不足的问题。

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

Motivation: 甲状腺癌全球发病率上升，及时准确诊断对治疗策略和患者预后至关重要。

Method: 将自适应CNN与CDF9/7小波结合，小波细节系数通过n-scroll混沌系统调制以增强判别特征。

Result: 在DDTI数据集上达到98.17%准确率、98.76%灵敏度、97.58%特异性、97.55% F1分数和0.9912 AUC；混沌调制使准确率比仅使用CDF9/7的CNN提高8.79个百分点；优于EfficientNetV2-S、Swin-T、ViT-B/16和ConvNeXt-T等SOTA模型。

Conclusion: 小波-混沌-CNN管道在甲状腺超声分类中达到SOTA性能，具有强泛化能力和实际运行特性，适合临床集成。

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

TL;DR: 提出VFSI方法，通过基于能量的引导在扩散采样中强制实施物理约束，无需重新训练模型，显著提高了交通模拟的物理有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型生成的交通模拟虽然逼真，但系统性地违反物理约束，50%的轨迹违反基本物理定律，如车辆碰撞、驶离道路等

Method: 提出Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI)，在扩散采样过程中通过基于能量的引导强制实施约束，将碰撞避免和运动学约束作为能量函数，引导去噪过程生成物理有效的轨迹

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset的200个城市场景中，VFSI将碰撞率降低67%（从24.6%到8.1%），整体有效性提高87%（从50.3%到94.2%），同时改进真实度指标（ADE从1.34m到1.21m）

Conclusion: 在推理过程中显式强制约束对于物理有效的交通模拟既是必要的也是充分的，模型无关的方法证明了这一点

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

TL;DR: 提出OASIS，一种高效的一步扩散模型，通过注意力专业化路由和渐进式训练策略解决视频超分辨率中的冗余问题，在性能和推理速度上均达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用生成扩散模型到视频超分辨率会导致冗余，因为低质量视频已包含大量内容信息，这会增加计算开销和学习负担。

Method: OASIS采用注意力专业化路由机制，根据注意力头的内在行为将其分配到不同模式，减少冗余同时保留预训练知识；并提出渐进式训练策略，从时间一致退化开始逐步转向不一致设置。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上均达到最先进的性能，相比一步扩散基线（如SeedVR2）提供6.2倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: OASIS通过注意力专业化和渐进训练有效解决了视频超分辨率中的冗余问题，实现了高性能和高效率的平衡。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

Motivation: 360度图像在各领域应用日益增多，但获取大规模标注数据集用于360度深度估计仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 将360度图像转换为六面立方体贴图表示，使用透视基础模型估计深度和表面法线，并通过基于图的优化技术解决不同面之间的深度尺度不一致问题。

Result: 在多个数据集（Matterport3D、Stanford2D3D、360Loc）上表现出优越性能，并在下游任务中验证了其有效性，如特征匹配（3.2~5.4%）和运动恢复结构（0.2~9.7%）的AUC@5指标提升。

Conclusion: 该方法利用基础模型在零样本设置中的固有鲁棒性，实现了无需训练的360度深度估计，并在多个基准测试中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

Conclusion: SMART-R1是一个简单而强大的R1风格训练框架，能够有效增强基础模型在多智能体交通仿真中的性能。

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance
gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training
framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim

Conclusion: TREAT-Net有潜力成为非侵入性的患者分流工具，特别是在冠状动脉造影资源有限的欠发达地区。

Abstract: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing Acute Coronary
Syndrome (ACS). However, its resource-intensive and invasive nature can expose
patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed
treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep
learning framework for ACS treatment prediction that leverages non-invasive
modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video
interpretation, along with a late fusion mechanism to align predictions across
modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms
unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an
AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy

to those reported on general-purpose benchmarks. However, when expressed in
terms of distance in the shared workspace the best median error is 16.48 cm
quantifying the practical limitations of current methods. We conclude by
discussing these limitations and offering recommendations on how to best
integrate gaze estimation as a modality in HRI systems.

Conclusion: SIE3D成功解决了从单图像和文本生成可控3D头像的挑战，实现了高质量的身份保持和表达准确性。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,
as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via
text. This paper proposes SIE3D, a framework that generates expressive 3D
avatars from a single image and descriptive text. SIE3D fuses identity features
from the image with semantic embedding from text through a novel conditioning
scheme, enabling detailed control. To ensure generated expressions accurately
match the text, it introduces an innovative perceptual expression loss
function. This loss uses a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize the
generation process, guaranteeing expression accuracy. Extensive experiments
show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming
competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a
single consumer-grade GPU. Project page:

TL;DR: FrameMind是一个端到端强化学习框架，通过动态帧采样策略实现自适应视频理解，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解模型采用固定帧采样策略，无法根据具体问题需求自适应地收集视觉证据，导致在需要广泛时间覆盖或精细空间细节的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出FrameMind框架，使用强化学习训练动态采样策略，包含Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought(FiCOT)交替进行文本推理和主动视觉感知，以及Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling(DRFS)和DRFS-GRPO算法。

Result: 在MLVU和VideoMME等挑战性基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有模型，推进了灵活高效视频理解的技术水平。

Conclusion: FrameMind通过动态视觉信息请求机制，实现了更灵活和高效的视频理解，为自适应视频分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对高光谱图像的广义类别发现框架，通过原型子空间建模来更好地捕捉类别结构，显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要针对RGB图像，其假设和建模策略不适用于高维且具有复杂光谱结构的高光谱图像

Method: 使用一组基向量为每个类别建模子空间表示，引入基向量正交性和重构约束来指导学习

Result: 在真实高光谱图像数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于最先进的GCD方法

Conclusion: 为高光谱环境下的广义类别发现建立了坚实基础

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为恶劣环境下智能交通系统的可靠感知提供了新的建模范式，在雾霾天气行人轨迹预测任务中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出直接在原始Bayer马赛克数据上学习图像重建，相比传统的后ISP sRGB图像处理，能获得更优的重建效果，特别是在雨景去噪任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图像重建网络在ISP处理后的sRGB图像上训练，但ISP处理会不可逆地混合颜色、裁剪动态范围并模糊细节。作者希望通过直接在原始Bayer数据上学习来避免这些信息损失。

Method: 使用原始Bayer马赛克数据进行训练；创建Raw-Rain基准数据集（包含12位Bayer和位深度匹配的sRGB真实雨景图像）；引入信息守恒评分（ICS）作为颜色不变性评估指标。

Result: 在测试集上，原始域模型相比sRGB结果提升了+0.99 dB PSNR和+1.2% ICS，同时运行速度更快，计算量减半（GFLOPs减少50%）。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持在低层视觉任务中采用ISP后置范式，为端到端可学习相机管道打开了大门。

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end
learnable camera pipelines.

<details>

Motivation: 现有超像素方法独立于聚类任务进行分割，导致分割结果与后续聚类目标不一致，且传统子空间聚类计算和内存成本高

Method: 基于展开ADMM的自表示网络提供模型驱动信号，指导可微分超像素模块，联合优化获得聚类感知的分割，每个超像素学习独特的紧凑度参数

Conclusion: 联合优化框架通过反馈机制产生聚类感知的分割，同时保持光谱和空间结构，实现了更灵活自适应的超像素分割

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

TL;DR: 该研究发现，在预训练视觉模型上使用单一任务数据进行剪枝，不仅能保持该任务的性能，还能保持模型在未见任务上的零样本性能。剪枝后的模型经过微调后，不仅能在原始任务上提升性能，还能恢复在未见任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉模型虽然具有可迁移性，但其计算和存储成本限制了实际部署。传统剪枝方法需要任务特定数据，但当下游任务未知时，这成为一个挑战。本文旨在研究数据如何影响预训练视觉模型的剪枝效果。

Method: 使用剪枝初始化方法在预训练视觉模型上进行压缩，研究在不同任务数据上剪枝对模型性能的影响，包括在原始任务和未见任务上的表现。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，在单一任务上剪枝能保持模型在未见任务上的零样本性能。剪枝后微调不仅能提升原始任务性能，还能恢复未见任务的性能。

Conclusion: 这种现象归因于在大规模数据集上广泛预训练所诱导的有利损失景观，表明预训练模型具有强大的泛化能力，即使经过剪枝压缩也能保持多任务性能。

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在多模态基准测试中表现良好，但在结构化推理和精确接地方面仍存在局限。现有研究表明添加简单视觉结构能提高准确性，但其内部机制尚不清楚。

Method: 通过表示分析和因果干预，研究外部线索如何诱导Grounding IDs（潜在标识符），这些标识符在嵌入空间中形成稳健的分区内对齐，并减少图像与文本之间的模态差距。

Result: 研究发现Grounding IDs作为符号机制，增强了相关组件之间的注意力，改善了跨模态接地，减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: Grounding IDs是解释外部线索如何增强多模态绑定的关键符号机制，既提供了可解释性，又带来了鲁棒性的实际改进。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

Motivation: 质疑帧是否是视频自回归的自然原子单元，探索更合适的预测单元来改进视频生成。

Method: 提出VideoAR框架，支持多种预测单元：完整帧、关键细节帧、多尺度细化、时空立方体，其中时空立方体允许模型在空间和时间维度上同时操作。

Result: 基于立方体的预测在质量、速度和时序一致性方面表现最佳，超越了现有基准，实现了更快的推理速度，并能扩展到分钟级序列。

Conclusion: 这项工作鼓励重新思考视频和其他时空域中的序列分解方式，打破了逐帧生成的限制。

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse
modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and
human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient
framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in
video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances
in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance
through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including
insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational

temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves
RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance
video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting
computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal
Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential
spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)
strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video
clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code

Conclusion: GMS框架通过协同利用通用和专用模型的优势，在GUI定位任务中表现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化潜力。

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Motivation: 揭示AI系统即使从看似平衡的数据源也可能引入偏见，特别关注AI面部审美预测中的种族偏见问题，警告AI在塑造审美规范中的作用。

Method: 使用SCUT-FBP5500和MEBeauty数据集训练模型，通过严格的统计验证（Kruskal-Wallis H检验、事后Dunn分析）和跨数据集验证，在平衡的FairFace数据集上评估模型表现。

Result: 两个模型在不同种族群体间都表现出显著的预测差异（p < 0.001），交叉验证显示算法放大了社会审美偏见而非缓解，仅4.8-9.5%的组间比较满足分布均等标准。

Conclusion: 当前AI审美预测方法存在不足，提出了详细的缓解策略，强调需要开发更公平的美容技术。

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current
AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons
satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed
and discussed in detail.

Result: 实验结果显示FastVSR相比多步模型加速111.9倍，相比现有单步模型加速3.92倍，同时保持了良好的性能。

Conclusion: FastVSR通过高压缩VAE和稳定的训练框架，在视频超分辨率任务中实现了显著的推理效率提升，为实时应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

Motivation: 青少年特发性脊柱侧凸(AIS)需要评估冠状面和矢状面对齐，但现有无辐射方法主要关注冠状面，矢状面评估仍缺乏可靠的无辐射解决方案。

Method: 采用双阶段架构：先估计侧位脊柱结构，再合成相应X光片。引入基于注意力的快速傅里叶卷积模块整合解剖特征，以及空间变形网络建模侧位形态变化。

Conclusion: 该研究为矢状面脊柱评估提供了有前景的无辐射解决方案，推进了AIS的全面评估。

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Result: 在医学图像分类任务中，该方法提高了蒸馏性能，同时保持与原始数据集训练相当的模型精度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了医学数据共享的隐私问题，通过改进轨迹匹配策略提升了数据集蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to
privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation
offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,
overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address
this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric
structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy
that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments
on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves
distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model
accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets. Our code is available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度图像分类中，由于类间差异细微，评估样本信息量特别具有挑战性。

Method: 引入多方面信息量度量，结合差异-混淆不确定性和校准多样性。差异-混淆不确定性量化局部特征融合时的类别方向性和结构稳定性，然后进行不确定性加权聚类以多样化不确定性样本，最后校准多样性以最大化所选样本的全局多样性同时保持局部代表性。

Result: 在7个细粒度图像数据集上的26个不同实验设置中，该方法相比最先进方法实现了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: DECERN方法能有效感知细粒度图像间的差异性并评估样本价值，在细粒度图像分类的主动学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题，获取大型医学图像数据集具有挑战性，特别是在3D模态如CT和MRI中。现有生成模型在输出多样性方面存在局限，无法准确表示3D医学图像。

Method: 采用GAN生成肿瘤掩膜，扩散模型生成肿瘤纹理，以放射组学特征作为生成条件。放射组学特征是生物学基础良好的高维手工语义特征。

Result: 模型在四个不同器官（肾脏、肺、乳腺和大脑）的CT和MRI肿瘤上进行了测试。合成图像有效辅助下游任务训练，并通过专家评估验证了真实性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成多样化的肿瘤图像，支持肿瘤的移除、操作和重新定位，在治疗规划中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.
Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the
potential to help with precision medicine.

TL;DR: 提出了TaSe框架，通过解构语言查询中的对象、属性和关系，并重新构建层次化表示，显著提升了视觉语言模型在复杂查询下的物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理包含描述性属性和关系从句的复杂查询时表现有限，主要原因是文本编码器无法有效分离目标对象与其属性和关系。

Method: 提出TaSe框架：1）构建层次化合成字幕数据集；2）Talk in Pieces模块通过解构损失函数将文本嵌入分解为对象、属性和关系三个组件；3）See in Whole模块学习将解构的组件聚合成层次化结构嵌入。

Result: 在OmniLabel基准测试中实现了24%的性能提升，证明了语言组合性的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过引入层次化语言结构归纳偏置，TaSe框架能够生成细粒度的多模态表示，显著提升基于语言的物体检测性能。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

TL;DR: 开发了一个高效的3D深度学习框架T1C-RFlow，使用预训练自编码器和整流流扩散模型，从多参数MRI生成T1对比增强图像，避免了钆基对比剂的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钆基对比剂在T1加权MRI中广泛使用但存在风险，包括肾源性系统性纤维化和给药不一致导致的图像变异。需要开发无对比剂的替代方法。

Method: 提出3D潜在整流流模型：1) 使用预训练自编码器将T1w和T2-FLAIR图像编码到潜在空间；2) 在潜在空间中训练整流流扩散模型；3) 使用BraTS 2024数据集（胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、转移瘤）进行训练。

Result: T1C-RFlow在定性和定量评估中均优于基准模型，实现了优异的图像质量指标（NMSE 0.044-0.098，SSIM 0.905-0.937），且去噪时间显著更快（6.9秒/体积）。

Conclusion: 该方法生成的合成T1C图像与真实图像高度相似，处理时间远少于传统扩散模型，为脑肿瘤的无对比剂MRI提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding
capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges:
maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to

MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified
architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a

Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型（如SAM）在医学图像分割中由于缺乏领域特定适应而表现不佳的问题，同时需要在临床实践中以最小资源需求高效微调模型。

Method: 提出三个定制组件：1）互补细节增强网络（CDEN）使用深度可分离卷积和多尺度融合捕获边界敏感特征；2）在ViT块中集成低秩适配器优化医学上下文特征表示和注意力；3）在掩码解码器中采用低秩张量注意力机制。

Conclusion: BALR-SAM框架有效解决了医学图像分割中视觉基础模型的领域适应问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算资源需求，为临床实践提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

Abstract: Despite the promise of foundation models in medical AI, current systems
remain limited - they are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning
processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present
EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify
broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and
testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global
datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties:
dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology.
External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional
datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to
assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with
pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation
for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858)
and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models.
In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across
nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External
validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with
competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training
strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not
only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step
reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early
multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that
could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world
clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从显式动作轨迹生成逼真的机器人视频是构建有效世界模型和机器人基础模型的关键步骤，需要充分利用动作参数来增强控制性。

Method: 1. 动作缩放的无分类器引导：根据动作幅度动态调节引导强度；2. 动作缩放的噪声截断：调整初始采样噪声分布以更好地匹配期望运动动态。

Result: 在真实机器人操作数据集上的实验表明，这些技术显著提高了不同机器人环境中的动作连贯性和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过主动利用动作参数而非被动条件化，提出的训练免费推理时技术有效提升了机器人视频生成的控制性和质量。

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

TL;DR: 提出Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR)新范式，直接在视觉嵌入空间进行自回归推理，相比传统语言空间推理显著提升视觉问答性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs虽然引入了CoT推理，但推理仍局限于语言空间，视觉信息被当作静态前提条件处理，存在根本性限制

Method: 使用视觉编码器将图像投影到与语言模型共享的联合语义空间中的视觉token，训练语言模型生成能够重建关键视觉token的潜在状态，实现潜在视觉推理

Result: 在感知密集型视觉问答任务上取得显著提升，MMVP数据集上达到71.67%，相比Qwen2.5-VL的66.67%有明显改进

Conclusion: LVR通过直接在视觉嵌入空间进行推理，大幅改善了细粒度视觉理解和感知能力

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专为多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)设计的图像编解码器CoTAM，通过自适应保护多级特征来适应不同下游任务需求，相比传统编解码器可节省35.99%的码率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像编解码器针对人类视觉系统优化，不适合MLLMs的多任务需求。压缩失真对不同层级图像特征的影响不均，导致对MLLMs下游任务产生不同影响。

Method: 提出CoTAM编解码器：编码器利用CLIP浅层注意力生成重要性图进行比特分配；解码器集成轻量适配器和多级损失函数，确保低层细节和高层语义的忠实重建。

Result: 实验验证CoTAM在保持MLLMs任务性能的同时，相比现有最先进神经编解码器可节省高达35.99%的码率。

Conclusion: CoTAM通过自适应保护多级特征，有效解决了MLLMs的图像压缩需求，在码率节省和任务性能间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

Conclusion: S²NN通过亚比特权重表示有效解决了SNN的压缩和加速问题，提出的OS-Quant和MPFD方法显著提升了高度压缩网络的性能，为边缘计算提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing
applications.

Conclusion: CDM中使用的循环策略可以成为改进基于扩散的医学图像生成的有效方法，在数据增强、反事实和疾病进展建模中具有应用价值

Abstract: Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality
synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge.
In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion
models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image
realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency
between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints,
enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a
combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and
PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image
quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,
counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于骨架的鲁棒点云配准框架SRRF，通过引入抗干扰的骨架表示来提高配准的鲁棒性和准确性，在多种干扰场景下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的点云常受传感器限制、环境噪声和预处理误差影响，导致密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形，现有配准方法对这些干扰敏感且配准精度下降。

Method: 集成骨架结构到配准过程中，结合从损坏点云对齐和其骨架对齐获得的变换来实现最优配准，并设计了分布距离损失函数来强制源和目标骨架之间的一致性。

Result: 在多种损坏数据集上的实验评估表明，SRRF在各种干扰场景（包括密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形）中始终优于最先进的配准方法。

Conclusion: SRRF在处理损坏点云方面具有鲁棒性，使其成为现实场景中3D感知任务的潜在方法。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: CEGC为挑战性条件下的部分点云配准提供了一个可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging
conditions.

Motivation: 解决传统3D分割方法需要多视角图像、3D模型标注或可能模糊的文本描述的问题，提供更实用和精确的3D分割方案。

Method: 使用少量用户标注的图像作为输入，优化每个分割片段的文本token，通过跨视角部件对应损失微调模型，在推理时通过多视角渲染、UV空间投票、噪声优化等技术实现3D分割。

Result: 在定量和定性评估中都显著优于现有方法，为语义和非语义3D分割任务提供了实用且通用的解决方案。

Conclusion: ASIA框架通过少量图像标注实现了高质量的3D分割，特别是在处理非语义和难以文本描述的部件时表现出色，为3D分割领域提供了新的实用方法。

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

Motivation: 解决传统大视觉语言模型在长视频理解中存在的均匀帧采样和静态文本推理效率低下问题，特别是处理视觉密集型视频任务时的困难。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：首先通过监督微调(SFT)建立基础动作能力，然后通过强化学习(RL)优化策略决策；深入探索奖励函数设计。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均提升10.4%，7B模型在LongVideo-Reason上达到76.1%准确率，仅使用20.6帧，比竞争对手少20倍帧数。

Conclusion: FrameThinker框架在长视频推理中实现了前所未有的效率和效果，建立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.

Motivation: 冷冻电子断层扫描子断层图分析面临注释稀缺、噪声严重和泛化能力差等挑战，需要开发能够有效处理这些问题的通用基础模型。

Method: 1) CryoEngine合成数据生成器产生904k子断层图；2) APT-ViT模型通过自适应相位标记化增强几何和语义变化鲁棒性；3) NRCL噪声鲁棒对比学习策略稳定表示学习。

Result: 在24个合成和真实数据集上的评估显示，在所有三个主要子断层图任务上实现了最先进性能，并对未见数据集具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了冷冻电子断层扫描中可扩展和鲁棒的子断层图分析，为领域提供了首个基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征度量方法可能遗漏复杂的互相关关系，而相关度量方法由于处理4D相关图导致计算成本高昂，需要一种能克服这些限制的高效方法。

Method: 采用选择性状态空间模型，实现相似性感知的选择性扫描机制，基于Mamba的线性复杂度算法有效细化4D相关图，同时保持特征图分辨率和感受野。

Result: 在标准语义对应基准测试中，MambaMatcher实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MambaMatcher通过选择性状态空间模型成功克服了传统方法的局限性，为语义对应任务提供了一种高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet
challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance
visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while
recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs
due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel
method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling
high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By
implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's
linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map
effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field.
Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that
MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于三平面融合的多视角鸡只计数模型TP-MVCC，通过几何投影将多摄像头特征整合到统一地面平面，在密集遮挡场景下实现精确计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能农业中动物计数的挑战，特别是在拥挤场景下由于遮挡和有限相机视角导致的计数困难。

Method: 使用三平面融合方法，提取单视角特征，通过空间变换对齐，解码场景级密度图进行精确计数。

Result: 在真实养殖条件下构建首个多视角丝羽鸡数据集，TP-MVCC显著优于单视角和传统融合方法，达到95.1%的准确率。

Conclusion: TP-MVCC在密集遮挡场景下表现出强大的鲁棒性，展示了在智能农业中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult
in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this,
we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which
leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from
multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts
single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a
scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct
the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions.
Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and
conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong
robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential
for intelligent agriculture.

*Guolin Ke,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereAR通过将AR模型的输入输出约束在固定半径的超球面上，解决了VAE潜在空间中异质方差导致的方差崩溃问题，在图像生成任务中超越了扩散和掩码生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中很有前景，但连续token的AR变体通常落后于潜在扩散和掩码生成模型。核心问题是VAE潜在空间中的异质方差，在AR解码过程中会被放大，特别是在分类器自由引导下会导致方差崩溃。

Method: 提出SphereAR方法，其核心设计是将所有AR输入输出（包括CFG后）约束在固定半径的超球面上（恒定L2范数），利用了超球面VAE。理论分析表明超球面约束移除了尺度分量（方差崩溃的主要原因），从而稳定了AR解码。

Result: 在ImageNet生成任务中，SphereAR-H（943M）为AR模型设定了新的最先进水平，达到FID 1.34。即使在小规模下，SphereAR-L（479M）达到FID 1.54，SphereAR-B（208M）达到1.92，匹配或超越了更大的基线模型。

Conclusion: 这是首次纯下一个token的自回归图像生成器（光栅顺序）在可比参数规模下超越了扩散和掩码生成模型。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对文本查询或单图像场景，无法处理需要多图像输入和外部农业知识的真实世界农业场景，且缺乏系统性的质量控制和适应能力。

Method: 设计包含四个角色的多智能体框架：检索器负责获取外部信息，反思器评估充分性并触发重新检索，两个回答器并行生成候选答案以减少偏见，改进器通过迭代检查来完善答案并确保多图像信息的有效对齐。

Result: 在AgMMU基准测试中，该框架在多图像农业问答任务上取得了有竞争力的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该多智能体框架能够有效处理农业视觉问答中的多图像输入和上下文不完整问题，通过协作机制实现系统性的质量控制和持续改进。

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV-Diffusion是一种隐式潜在视频扩散模型，通过生成神经网络权重来合成视频，将视频表示为统一的神经网络参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频标记化方法将视频编码为逐帧特征图，而NeRV-Diffusion旨在将视频整体压缩并生成为统一的神经网络，提高视频合成的效率和质量。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1)基于超网络的标记器将视频从像素空间编码到神经参数空间；2)隐式扩散变换器对隐式神经表示权重进行去噪。通过重用瓶颈潜在变量、重新设计权重分配、上采样连接和输入坐标来实现高斯分布的权重。

Result: 在UCF-101和Kinetics-600等真实世界视频基准测试中，NeRV-Diffusion达到了优于先前基于INR模型的视频生成质量，并与最新的非隐式模型性能相当。

Conclusion: NeRV-Diffusion提供了一种高效的视频生成方法，通过隐式神经表示权重实现了高质量的视频合成和平滑的权重空间插值。

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

Motivation: 现有方法使用Transformer捕捉长距离依赖关系，但存在计算成本高和局部细节信息提取不足的问题。

Method: 提出U型网络LamFormer，使用线性注意力Mamba模块在增强金字塔编码器中捕捉多尺度长距离依赖，构建并行层次特征聚合模块整合不同层特征，设计降维Transformer全局建模上采样特征。

Result: 在七个复杂多样的数据集上优于现有分割方法，在模型性能和复杂度之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: LamFormer在多器官医学图像分割任务中表现出色，有效解决了Transformer的计算效率和局部细节提取问题。

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DRIFT防御方法，通过破坏梯度共识来增强对抗鲁棒性，在ImageNet上显著优于现有防御方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对对抗样本高度脆弱，现有防御在梯度可估计时容易失效。研究发现梯度共识是导致对抗样本可迁移性的关键因素

Method: 提出DRIFT方法，使用可学习的轻量级滤波器随机集成，通过最大化Jacobian空间和logit空间的响应差异来强制梯度不协调，同时保持自然预测

Result: 在ImageNet上对CNN和Vision Transformer都取得了显著的鲁棒性提升，在自适应白盒、迁移和梯度无关攻击下优于最先进的预处理、对抗训练和基于扩散的防御方法

Conclusion: 梯度分歧是构建实用且可泛化对抗防御的有效原则，DRIFT以可忽略的运行时间和内存成本实现了这些改进

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus}--the tendency of randomized transformations to yield
aligned gradients--as a key driver of adversarial transferability. Attackers
exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain effective across
transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent Response in Filtered
Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters
trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior randomized
defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces \emph{gradient
dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and logit-space responses
while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we
formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical analysis linking
consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a consensus-divergence training
strategy combining prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space
separation, and adversarial robustness; and (iii) we show that DRIFT achieves
substantial robustness gains on ImageNet across CNNs and Vision Transformers,
outperforming state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and
diffusion-based defenses under adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and
gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers these improvements with negligible
runtime and memory cost, establishing gradient divergence as a practical and
generalizable principle for adversarial defense.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在特定领域任务（如UI理解和生成）中仍面临准确性和质量挑战，需要专门优化的解决方案。

Method: 使用监督微调(SFT)结合组相对策略优化(GRPO)增强UI理解能力，使用直接偏好优化(DPO)提升UI生成质量，并设计了LLM友好的领域特定语言(DSL)和工作流程。

Result: 在UI理解任务上达到最先进性能，超越更大的通用MLLM和同等规模的UI专用模型；在UI生成任务上以更低的计算成本达到与更大模型相当的效果。

Conclusion: 集成理解和生成任务可以相互促进，提高两个任务的准确性和质量，证明了统一模型在UI领域的有效性。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-X提出了一种两端分离、中间共享的X形架构来解决多模态模型中视觉和文本的梯度冲突问题，在保持参数效率的同时实现了优越的训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于共享自回归变换器的统一多模态模型存在严重的梯度冲突问题，特别是在浅层和深层，这是由于图像和文本在低层统计特性上的根本差异导致的。

Method: Uni-X采用两端分离、中间共享的X形架构：初始和最终层专门用于模态特定处理，中间层保持共享参数进行高层语义融合，这种设计消除了两端的梯度冲突并减轻了共享层的残余冲突。

Result: 在相同训练条件下，Uni-X实现了优越的训练效率；当扩展到30亿参数并使用更大训练数据时，Uni-X匹配或超越了70亿参数的AR基UMMs，在图像生成上获得82的GenEval分数，同时在文本和视觉理解任务上表现强劲。

Conclusion: Uni-X为未来统一多模态建模提供了一个参数高效且可扩展的基础架构，有效解决了多模态训练中的梯度冲突问题。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出R²M框架，通过模型合并解决深度伪造检测问题，无需重新训练即可适应新伪造技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造生成器快速演进，使得数据收集和重复训练变得不切实际。模型合并适合深度伪造检测，因为专家模型共享相同的二元决策，仅在生成器特定伪影上有所不同。

Method: 提出Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R²M)，通过低秩分解估计共享的Real组件，将每个专家模型分解为Real对齐部分和Fake残差，使用层级秩截断对残差去噪，并通过每任务范数匹配进行聚合。

Result: 在分布内、跨数据集和未见数据集上，R²M优于联合训练和其他合并基线方法。

Conclusion: R²M具有可组合性，当出现新的伪造家族时，只需微调一个专家模型并重新合并，无需重新训练整个系统。

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as
clouds.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了MCAE标注引擎，利用空间自相关原理，通过语义一致的掩码组作为最小标注单元，显著提高亚米级遥感图像标注效率1-2个数量级，并构建了包含140亿像素的HiCity-LC数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亚米级遥感图像缺乏高质量标注数据集，现有标注方法不可靠或成本过高，限制了大规模土地覆盖制图的潜力。

Method: 基于空间自相关原理，提出MCAE标注引擎，将语义一致的掩码组作为最小标注单元，实现多实例同时标注。

Result: 标注效率提高1-2个数量级，构建了HiCity-LC数据集（约140亿像素），在五个中国主要城市生成的土地覆盖图分类精度超过85%。

Conclusion: MCAE具有可扩展性和实用性，HiCity-LC是首个公开的亚米级城市级土地覆盖基准数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

### [249] [REALIGN: Regularized Procedure Alignment with Matching Video Embeddings via Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24382)
*Soumyadeep Chandra,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REALIGN是一个基于正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输的自监督程序学习框架，能够处理教学视频中的背景片段、重复动作和非单调步骤顺序问题，相比传统方法有显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实教学视频通常包含背景片段、重复动作和乱序步骤，这违反了传统对齐方法的单调性假设。现有方法如OPEL仅依赖特征相似性，无法捕捉任务的高阶时间结构。

Method: 提出R-FPGWOT（正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输），联合建模视觉对应关系和时间关系，采用部分对齐方案处理无关帧和重复动作。结合序列间对比学习稳定训练。

Result: 在EgoProceL、ProceL和CrossTask基准测试中，REALIGN实现了高达18.9%的平均F1分数提升和超过30%的时间IoU增益，同时产生更可解释的传输映射。

Conclusion: REALIGN框架通过联合建模视觉和时间关系，有效处理教学视频中的复杂时序结构，在程序学习任务中取得了显著优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Vid-LLM，一种基于视频的3D多模态大语言模型，无需外部3D数据输入，通过几何先验提升场景感知性能，在3D问答、密集描述和视觉定位任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D多模态大语言模型依赖3D数据输入，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。需要开发不依赖外部3D数据的实用3D场景理解方法。

Method: 使用视频输入，设计交叉任务适配器模块对齐3D几何先验与视觉语言表示，引入度量深度模型恢复真实尺度几何，采用两阶段蒸馏优化策略进行微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了方法在3D问答、3D密集描述和3D视觉定位任务上的有效性，展示了优越的多任务能力。

Conclusion: Vid-LLM通过视频输入和几何先验集成，实现了无需外部3D数据的3D场景理解，具有实际部署的可行性。

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

*Junyi Gu,Beatriz Cabrero-Daniel,Ali Nouri,Lydia Armini,Christian Berger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PCICF框架，用于系统识别和分类弱势道路使用者(VRU)情境，支持自动驾驶出租车(robotaxi)在操作设计域(ODD)内的事故分析。该框架基于SMIRK数据集扩展为MoreSMIRK多行人交叉情境字典，使用空间填充曲线(SFCs)进行特征匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶出租车在特定ODD内商业化部署，需要可靠检测弱势道路使用者(行人、自行车骑手等)。端到端AI系统需要高质量数据来训练和评估，但目前缺乏系统化的VRU情境分类方法。

Method: 1. 扩展SMIRK数据集为MoreSMIRK多行人交叉情境结构化字典
2. 使用空间填充曲线(SFCs)将多维场景特征转换为特征模式
3. 与MoreSMIRK中的条目进行匹配

Result: 在包含150多个手动标注行人交叉视频的PIE真实数据集上评估，PCICF能成功识别和分类复杂行人交叉情境，包括行人群体合并和分离的情况。

Conclusion: PCICF框架能有效识别复杂行人交叉情境，且由于使用计算高效的SFCs组件，有潜力在自动驾驶出租车上用于ODD检测。提供了开源复现包。

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

Motivation: 从文本提示生成合成多视图图像是创建合成3D资产的关键桥梁，需要解决生成速度和视图一致性的问题。

Method: 提出新颖的时空角潜在空间，将空间外观和角度视角偏差编码到单一潜在表示中；采用多步骤训练策略进行有效训练。

Result: RapidMV在一致性和延迟方面优于现有方法，同时保持竞争性的质量和文本-图像对齐效果。

Abstract: Generating synthetic multi-view images from a text prompt is an essential
bridge to generating synthetic 3D assets. In this work, we introduce RapidMV, a
novel text-to-multi-view generative model that can produce 32 multi-view
synthetic images in just around 5 seconds. In essence, we propose a novel
spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular
viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and
multi-view consistency. We achieve effective training of RapidMV by
strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We
demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency
and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

### [253] [CLQ: Cross-Layer Guided Orthogonal-based Quantization for Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24416)
*Kai Liu,Shaoqiu Zhang,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLQ是一种针对扩散变换器(DiTs)的跨层引导正交量化方法，通过交叉块校准、正交平滑和跨层参数搜索三个关键技术，在W4A4量化下实现几乎无损的视觉生成质量，同时获得3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)虽然提升了视觉生成质量，但模型规模和复杂度限制了其在边缘设备上的实际部署。模型后训练量化(PTQ)作为高效压缩技术可以减少内存消耗和加速推理，但会带来性能下降。

Method: CLQ包含三个关键设计：1)交叉块校准(CBC)获取准确的校准数据；2)正交平滑(OBS)量化通道异常值并使用块Hadamard矩阵平滑；3)跨层参数搜索(CLPS)进行参数搜索。

Result: 在图像和视频生成模型上评估，CLQ成功将模型压缩到W4A4量化，视觉质量和指标仅有可忽略的下降，实现了3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速。

Conclusion: CLQ方法有效解决了DiTs模型在边缘设备部署的挑战，通过创新的量化技术实现了高效的模型压缩，为扩散变换器的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our
code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了图像数据集质量评估方法，开发了一个结合CleanVision和Fastdup工具的增强流水线，通过自动阈值选择提升低质量图像检测性能，实验显示不同质量问题对模型性能影响不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型架构成熟，数据质量成为关键因素，但图像领域数据集质量的系统性研究仍然有限，需要开发系统化的质量评估方法。

Method: 使用CIFAKE数据集识别常见质量问题，结合CleanVision和Fastdup工具开发增强流水线，引入自动阈值选择机制，将低质量图像检测建模为二分类任务。

Result: 自动阈值方法在单扰动下将F1分数从0.6794提升到0.9468，双扰动下从0.7447提升到0.8557；去重策略将F1分数从0.4576提升到0.7928。

Conclusion: 卷积神经网络对某些失真具有韧性，但对模糊和严重降采样等遮蔽关键视觉特征的退化特别敏感，提出的工作流程有效提升了数据质量评估性能。

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

TL;DR: Proxy-GS是一种新颖的3D高斯溅射方法，通过引入代理系统实现遮挡感知，在保持高质量渲染的同时显著提升渲染速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯溅射方法在遮挡场景中存在冗余问题，缺乏遮挡感知能力，导致渲染效率低下和质量问题。

Method: 使用快速代理系统生成精确遮挡深度图，指导锚点和高斯剔除以加速渲染，并在训练时引导表面密集化以避免遮挡区域不一致。

Result: 在MatrixCity Streets等遮挡严重场景中，Proxy-GS不仅提升了MLP基高斯溅射的渲染能力，还实现了超过2.5倍的渲染速度提升，且渲染质量显著更高。

Conclusion: Proxy-GS通过引入遮挡感知代理系统，有效解决了3D高斯溅射中的冗余问题，实现了渲染质量和速度的双重提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有方法仅从外观相似性隐式学习光流估计，无法有效处理模态差异和几何不对齐问题。

Method: 采用解耦优化策略，协同训练模态转换网络和光流估计网络；提出几何感知数据合成流程和异常鲁棒损失；引入跨模态一致性约束联合优化两个网络。

Result: 在构建的跨模态光流基准测试中，DCFlow可与多种光流估计网络集成，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DCFlow通过解耦优化和跨模态一致性约束，有效解决了跨模态光流估计中的模态差异问题，实现了优异的无监督性能。

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准主要关注视频质量和时间一致性，但忽视了模型对输入图像特定主题语义的理解能力，以及生成视频是否符合物理规律和人类常识。

Method: 设计了四个主要评估维度：空间理解、属性绑定、类别理解和推理；基于多模态大语言模型开发了两种评估方法：实例级细粒度语义理解管道和基于反馈的推理管道；包含约500个精心构建的文本-图像对。

Result: 评估了一系列开源和闭源的I2V模型，并进行了人工评估，结果显示与提出的MLLM指标高度一致。

Conclusion: UI2V-Bench通过强调语义理解和推理能力，填补了I2V评估的关键空白，为未来研究和模型开发提供了稳健的框架和数据集。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受科幻小说《Simulacron-3》按需世界构建概念启发，旨在创建可根据用户交互动态展开的虚拟世界，克服传统全局世界生成或2D幻觉方法的局限性。

Method: 采用混合场景结构：对关键前景对象进行完整3D建模，同时对背景和非交互区域进行2D合成以确保效率。结合先进的表示学习和对象到3D技术，支持灵活视角操作和物理合理的场景动画。

Result: 在WorldScore基准测试中显著优于现有的2D和深度分层2.5D方法，能够提供动态、沉浸式且视觉连贯的探索体验。

Conclusion: NeoWorld通过按需渲染和混合表示方法，成功实现了从单张图像生成交互式3D虚拟世界，为用户提供了灵活的控制和沉浸式探索体验。

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个框架，通过问题转述和问题字幕两种策略合成更丰富的监督信号，提升视频问答模型的性能，在STAR和NExT-QA数据集上取得了新的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频问答模型的监督信号局限于孤立的事实问答对，无法捕捉视频的叙事和因果结构，限制了模型对视频内容的深度理解。

Method: 提出两种互补策略：问题转述(QBP)将现有问答对合成重构视频事件结构的叙事段落；问题字幕(QBC)生成细粒度视觉依据，为每个问题答案提供具体证据。利用生成模型合成数据，在统一的下一个词预测目标下训练视频问答模型。

Result: 在STAR和NExT-QA数据集上验证，显著提升准确率：3B模型在STAR达到72.5%(+4.9%)，7B模型在NExT-QA达到80.8%。QBP和QBC都大幅提升跨数据集泛化能力，QBP还加速模型收敛2.5倍以上。

Conclusion: 从孤立事实转向叙事连贯性和有依据的推理的数据合成方法，能够产生更准确、高效和可泛化的训练范式。

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

*Heechang Kim,Gwanghyun Kim,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Laban运动分析的零样本优化方法，用于在文本引导的运动生成模型中实现细粒度的表达性运动控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到运动合成虽然能生成高质量运动，但缺乏细粒度的表达性控制，主要由于数据集运动风格多样性不足以及自然语言难以表达定量特征。

Method: 将Laban Effort和Shape组件的量化方法无缝集成到文本引导运动生成模型中，通过推理时优化更新预训练扩散模型的文本嵌入，无需额外运动数据。

Result: 该方法能够根据目标Laban标签成功操纵运动属性，产生多样化的表达性运动质量，同时保持运动身份。

Conclusion: 提出的方法实现了可解释和表达性的人类运动生成控制，通过Laban运动分析提供了细粒度的运动质量控制。

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

TL;DR: 通过欧几里得几何问题训练提升多模态大语言模型的空间推理能力，在多个空间推理基准测试中实现零样本显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间智能是多模态大语言模型尚未解决的关键挑战，包括形状可视化、物体旋转、位置关系判断和数量估计等能力

Method: 构建包含3万道平面和立体几何问题的Euclid30K数据集，使用组相对策略优化对Qwen2.5VL和RoboBrain2.0系列模型进行微调，让模型学习识别形状、计数、关联实体并进行多步演绎推理

Result: 模型在四个空间推理基准测试中实现零样本显著提升，VSI-Bench平均准确率从34.5%提升到40.5%，RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B达到49.6%准确率，超越之前最先进的Spatial-MLLM模型

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究表明以几何为中心的微调可以为视觉语言模型带来广泛可迁移的空间技能

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and
Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种选择性表示框架，通过聚类和核心集选择方法将二手服装图像数据库缩小到原始大小的10%，同时保持检索准确性，并引入基于邻域同质性一致性得分的异常值去除方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚产业是废物和排放的主要贡献者，推动二手市场发展需要大规模评估二手服装。机器学习方法在促进二手市场创建和扩展中发挥重要作用，但需要解决二手图像检索的可扩展性问题。

Method: 首先使用聚类和核心集选择方法识别代表性样本，捕捉服装的关键特征和内部变异性；然后引入基于邻域同质性一致性得分的异常值去除方法，在选择前过滤掉非典型样本。

Result: 在DeepFashion Attribute、DeepFashion Con2Shop和DeepFashion2三个公开数据集上的评估显示，该方法在保持接近最优精度的同时，通过减少添加到向量数据库的图像数量，显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 通过战略性修剪和选择代表性图像向量，实现了性能与效率的权衡；将异常值去除方法应用于聚类技术，通过在选择前移除非判别性样本，可获得更高的检索性能。

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SCPO框架，通过语义课程偏好优化解决多模态大语言模型的视觉幻觉问题，使用渐进式课程训练和双向目标函数，在多个基准测试中显著降低幻觉率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在严重的视觉幻觉问题，即生成响应与视觉证据相矛盾。现有的直接偏好优化方法难以捕捉细粒度语义差异并容易导致捷径学习

Method: 提出语义课程偏好优化(SCPO)框架，构建基于语义难度的课程偏好对数据集，采用动态参考模型和对称双向目标函数进行训练

Result: 在LLaVA模型上的实验表明，SCPO在多个幻觉基准测试中优于基线模型，幻觉率降低高达62.9%，同时保持通用能力

Conclusion: SCPO是首个统一语义、对称性和课程学习的多模态大语言模型对齐框架，能有效缓解视觉幻觉问题，同时保持模型的通用性能

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法存在模态依赖不平衡问题，当主导模态在真实场景中退化时，整体性能显著下降，模态平衡成为实际多模态分割的关键挑战。

Method: 提出EQUISeg框架，基于四阶段跨模态Transformer块实现高效多模态融合和分层选择，设计自引导模块通过相互引导机制自适应调整模态贡献。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EQUISeg实现了显著的性能提升，有效缓解了分割任务中模态不平衡的不利影响。

Conclusion: EQUISeg通过均衡模态编码和自适应调整机制，成功解决了多模态分割中的模态不平衡问题，提升了模型在退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

Motivation: 标准CLIP文本编码器在复杂多目标场景的图像编辑中经常失败，无法有效处理目标数量和空间布局约束。

Method: QL-Adapter包含两个核心模块：图像-布局融合模块（ILFM）将布局先验与CLIP图像编码器的ViT补丁标记融合以增强空间结构理解；跨模态增强模块（CMAM）将图像特征注入文本分支以丰富文本嵌入并改进指令跟随。

Result: 在QL-Edit任务上的广泛实验表明，QL-Adapter实现了最先进的性能，并显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: QL-Adapter通过融合布局先验和跨模态特征增强，有效解决了复杂多目标场景的图像编辑挑战。

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Consistency Mid-Training (CMT)方法，在预训练和流映射训练之间插入轻量级中间阶段，显著提高训练稳定性和效率，在多个数据集上实现最先进的少步生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流映射模型（如一致性模型和均值流）虽然能实现少步生成，但训练不稳定、对超参数敏感且成本高昂。即使从预训练扩散模型初始化，仍存在将无限小步转换为长跳映射的不稳定性问题。

Method: 提出中间训练概念，在扩散预训练和最终流映射训练之间插入轻量级中间阶段CMT。该方法训练模型将预训练模型求解器轨迹上的点直接映射到求解器生成的干净样本，提供轨迹一致且稳定的初始化。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现最先进的性能：CIFAR-10上2步FID为1.97，ImageNet 64x64上为1.32，ImageNet 512x512上为1.84。相比一致性模型，训练数据和GPU时间减少高达98%。在ImageNet 256x256上，1步FID达到3.34，总训练时间比从零开始的均值流减少约50%。

Conclusion: CMT为训练流映射模型提供了一个原则性、高效且通用的框架，显著提高了训练稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过改进掩码生成和语义编码策略，有效提升了零样本开放词汇3D语义映射的性能，为具身AI和机器人提供了更可靠的场景理解能力。

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 解决Diffusion Bridge和Flow Matching两种方法在理论和实践上的混淆，明确各自的优劣和适用场景，为模型选择提供理论指导。

Method: 1. 从随机最优控制角度重新构建两种模型框架；2. 从最优传输理论分析插值系数效率；3. 提出基于潜在Transformer的Diffusion Bridge新架构；4. 使用相同结构实现Flow Matching进行公平比较。

Result: 理论证明Diffusion Bridge成本函数更低，轨迹更稳定自然；Flow Matching的插值系数在训练数据减少时效率下降。实验验证了这些理论预测，在图像修复、超分辨率、去模糊、去噪、转换和风格迁移等任务中进行了全面测试。

Conclusion: Diffusion Bridge在分布差异较大时表现更好，Flow Matching在数据充足且分布差异较小时有优势。两种模型各有适用场景，应根据具体任务和数据条件选择。

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion
Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with
the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various
experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting,
Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks,
systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different
difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align
perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the
respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSwap是一种针对大型视觉语言模型的隐蔽后门攻击方法，通过扰乱模型对物体关系的理解而非强制生成固定目标内容，实现了更高的规避性和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击使用固定目标模式，容易被检测到，因为模型会记住这些频繁模式并表现出过度自信。需要更隐蔽的攻击方式。

Method: 在训练时向选定样本注入视觉触发器，同时交换对应文本回答中关键token的语法角色，使用自适应token加权损失来强调学习交换的token。

Result: 实验表明TokenSwap在多个基准测试和各种LVLM架构上实现了高攻击成功率，同时保持了优越的规避性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: TokenSwap通过关注LVLM的组合理解能力，实现了比固定模式攻击更隐蔽的后门攻击，突显了LVLM安全性的新挑战。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE是一种基于扩散模型的类别级物体姿态估计方法，通过使用DINOv2特征作为连续语义先验，无需离散类别标签，能够泛化到已知类别之外的新物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放环境中，机器人会遇到未知物体，需要语义理解能力来泛化到已知类别和未知类别。现有方法依赖离散类别标签，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 结合DINOv2特征与逼真训练数据，通过交叉注意力注入连续语义先验，使用点法线噪声模型减少Sim2Real差距。

Result: 在合成训练的类别级物体姿态估计中，SCOPE在5°5cm指标上相对提升了31.9%，在两个实例级数据集上展示了超越已知类别的泛化能力，抓取未知类别物体的成功率高达100%。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过连续语义先验实现了对已知和未知类别物体的有效姿态估计，显著提升了泛化能力和实际应用效果。

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

Motivation: 构建联合的人脸-头骨可变形模型在远程诊断、手术规划等领域具有巨大潜力，但受到配对数据稀缺、配准精度不足以及临床应用探索有限的限制。

Method: 构建包含200多个样本的数据集，提出密集射线匹配配准方法确保拓扑一致性，建立BFSM模型通过共享系数空间实现双向形状推断和组织厚度建模。

Result: 实验证实了方法的鲁棒性和准确性，能够从单张图像进行3D人脸-头骨重建和手术规划预测。

Conclusion: BFSM模型解决了人脸-头骨建模的关键挑战，在医学应用中展现出巨大潜力，特别关注了颅面畸形患者的代表性不足问题。

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文评估了YOLOv11模型在血液细胞检测中的性能，创建了一个包含16,891张图像和298,850个标注细胞的大型数据集，发现YOLOv11 Medium变体在8:1:1数据分割下达到最佳平衡，mAP@0.5为0.934。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动外周血涂片分析劳动密集且主观，深度学习提供了有前景的替代方案，但缺乏对YOLOv11等先进模型在细粒度血液细胞检测中的系统评估。

Method: 创建大型标注数据集（16,891张图像，12种外周血细胞类别），全面评估五种YOLOv11变体（Nano到XLarge），使用两种数据分割策略（70:20:10和80:10:10），通过mAP、精确率、召回率、F1分数和计算效率等指标进行系统评估。

Result: YOLOv11 Medium变体在8:1:1分割下达到最佳平衡，mAP@0.5为0.934。更大模型仅带来边际精度提升但计算成本显著增加。8:1:1分割在所有模型中始终优于7:2:1分割。

Conclusion: YOLOv11（特别是Medium变体）是自动化细粒度外周血涂片检测的高效框架。公开的数据集为血液学中血细胞检测和分类研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构化最优传输的无监督框架，用于精英标枪投掷运动的上下文感知时间分割，无需手动标注即可识别运动阶段转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运动分析方法依赖手动标注或实验室设备，耗时昂贵且缺乏可扩展性。需要一种自动提取相关动力学变量的鲁棒方法。

Method: 使用结构化最优传输(SOT)增强注意力时空图卷积网络(ASTGCN)，实现无监督的运动阶段分割。

Result: 在测试数据上达到71.02%的平均精度和74.61%的F1分数，显著优于现有无监督方法。发布了包含211个专业标枪投掷视频的新数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为运动分析提供了一种可扩展的无监督解决方案，特别适用于需要精确生物力学阶段分析的体育项目。

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeRet是一个即插即用的框架，可将任何多模态大语言模型转换为两阶段检索器，无需额外训练就能实现强大的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在混合模态检索中展现出潜力，但通常需要大量后训练才能转换为检索编码器。本研究探索是否可以直接使用现成的MLLM作为检索器而无需训练。

Method: FreeRet框架包含两个阶段：首先直接从模型获取语义嵌入进行快速候选搜索，然后利用模型的推理能力进行精确重排序。关键技术包括绕过词汇对齐层、使用显式先验条件生成表示、通过中性选择框架减轻重排序中的框架效应。

Result: 在MMEB和MMEB-V2基准测试的46个数据集上，FreeRet显著优于经过数百万对数据训练的模型。该框架具有模型无关性，可跨MLLM家族和规模无缝扩展。

Conclusion: 研究表明，经过精心利用的预训练MLLM可以作为强大的检索引擎而无需训练，填补了其作为通用模型角色的关键空白。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

TL;DR: SPLICE是一个基于COIN教学视频数据集的人类标注基准，用于评估事件推理能力，包含3,381个视频和11,423个事件片段。评估显示视觉语言模型在重新排列事件序列任务上显著落后于人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在事件推理方面存在不足，需要专门的基准来评估其在时间、因果、空间、上下文和常识推理等多维度的能力。

Method: 从COIN数据集中筛选3,381个视频，分为12类180个子类，分割成11,423个事件片段。让人类参与者和视觉语言模型重新排列这些片段以形成连贯的事件序列。

Result: 视觉语言模型表现显著低于人类，即使使用人类标注的文本描述也只能部分提升模型性能。模型在时间因果推理主导的视频上表现相对较好，在上下文空间推理主导的视频上表现较差。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型仍然严重依赖语言先验而非视觉理解，在复杂的事件推理任务中与人类存在明显差距，特别是在需要上下文和空间推理的场景中。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

Motivation: 屏幕截图中的闪烁条纹严重影响可读性和感知质量，但该问题研究不足，需要专门的修复方法。

Method: 提出RIFLE框架：基于扩散模型，包含频闪先验估计器(FPE)预测条纹属性并注入修复网络，使用掩码损失(ML)聚焦条纹区域监督，提供模拟管道生成合成数据。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上，RIFLE在定量指标和视觉比较中始终优于现有图像重建基线方法，从轻微到严重闪烁条纹都表现良好。

Conclusion: 这是首个研究闪烁条纹模拟和去除的工作，为后续研究在数据集构建和去除模型设计方面奠定了良好基础。

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Method: 集成轻量级的基于槽的条件机制到预训练模型中，使用注册令牌处理背景/风格，槽条件模块处理对象。视频扩展采用不变槽注意力分离对象身份与姿态，以及基于Transformer的时间聚合器。

Result: 在对象发现、分割、组合编辑和可控图像生成方面达到最先进水平。视频方面在无监督视频对象分割和重建方面建立新基准，支持对象移除、替换和插入等高级编辑任务。

Conclusion: 建立了面向对象生成建模的通用可扩展方法，通过桥接人类对象感知和机器学习，扩展了交互式、结构化和用户驱动的生成工具的设计空间。

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

Conclusion: 针对性的分类增强为推进伪装目标分割性能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing

Conclusion: 开发了一个有效的自动分割管道用于TBI病变分割，Python实现已公开可用。

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without
visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking
among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python
implementation of our pipeline is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频生成模型计算成本高、推理速度慢的问题，实现低成本、高质量的长视频生成。

Method: 采用线性注意力机制(Linear DiT)和恒定内存KV缓存技术，结合有效的数据过滤和训练策略。

Result: 训练成本仅为MovieGen的1%，在12天内完成64 H100 GPU训练；相比同类模型快16倍，推理速度提升2.4倍。

Conclusion: SANA-Video实现了低成本、高质量的视频生成，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的即插即用的物理感知视频生成范式。

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了IWR-Bench基准测试，用于评估大视觉语言模型从视频重建交互式网页的能力，包含113个真实网站任务，测试结果显示当前最佳模型仅达到36.35%的总体分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注静态截图到代码的任务，忽略了真实网页应用中关键的动态交互特性，需要新的评估标准来衡量模型对交互逻辑的理解能力。

Method: 构建包含113个任务的IWR-Bench基准，涵盖100个真实网站、1,001个交互动作，包含用户交互视频和静态资源，采用代理作为裁判的自动评估框架。

Result: 在28个大视觉语言模型上的实验显示，最佳模型总体得分仅36.35%，功能正确性(24.39%)远低于视觉保真度(64.25%)，表明模型在时序动态推理和事件驱动逻辑合成方面存在严重不足。

Conclusion: IWR-Bench为视觉语言研究设立了具有挑战性的前沿，揭示了当前模型在处理动态交互网页重建任务时的关键局限性。

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is
available at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了偏振成像在水面漂浮碎片分割中的应用，发现偏振线索能提高低对比度物体的检测并抑制反射导致的误报，但会增加计算负担和新的误报风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水面漂浮碎片的准确分割常受到表面眩光和变化户外光照的影响，偏振成像提供了一种单传感器方法来减轻水面眩光对语义分割的干扰。

Method: 在PoTATO数据集上对最先进的融合网络进行基准测试，并与使用传统模型的单图像基线进行比较。

Result: 偏振线索有助于恢复低对比度物体并抑制反射引起的误报，相对于RGB输入提高了平均IoU并降低了轮廓误差。

Conclusion: 通过提供可复现的诊断基准和公开代码，帮助研究人员判断偏振相机是否适合其应用，并加速相关研究。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个越南语多模态医学数据集，包含156万对CT-PET图像和2757份完整临床报告，旨在解决医学视觉语言模型中PET/CT数据缺乏和低资源语言代表性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型在医学影像应用上面临挑战，主要原因是缺乏多样化的成像模态和多语言临床数据。大多数现有模型仅训练于部分成像模态，且主要关注高资源语言，限制了其泛化能力和临床实用性。

Method: 引入包含1,567,062对CT-PET图像和2,757份完整临床报告的新型越南语多模态医学数据集，并提出了包含数据增强和专家验证测试集的训练框架来增强视觉语言模型的学习能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，将本数据集纳入训练能显著提升现有视觉语言模型在医学报告生成和视觉问答等下游任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试将推动医学影像领域更鲁棒的视觉语言模型发展，特别是在低资源语言环境，并提升其在越南医疗保健中的临床相关性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的三模态目标跟踪方法，结合RGB、深度和热红外三种互补模态，通过正交投影约束融合深度和热红外信息，并作为提示集成到预训练RGB跟踪模型中，显著提升了复杂场景下的跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双模态跟踪方法在复杂场景中表现有限，主要原因是输入模态不足。为了解决这个问题，需要利用更多互补模态来增强跟踪的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了RDTTrack方法，通过正交投影约束融合深度和热红外模态，然后将融合结果作为提示集成到预训练的RGB跟踪基础模型中，有效协调三模态的互补信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在复杂场景下相比现有双模态方法在跟踪精度和鲁棒性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 三模态跟踪方法能够有效利用RGB、深度和热红外的互补特性，在复杂场景中提供更鲁棒的跟踪性能，为多模态跟踪研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExGS是一个新颖的前馈框架，通过统一通用高斯压缩(UGC)和GaussPainter，实现了3D高斯溅射的极端压缩，在保持渲染质量的同时达到100倍以上的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射压缩方法要么依赖昂贵的优化过程，要么采用无训练的剪枝和量化，在高压缩比下会降低渲染质量。需要一种能在保持高质量渲染的同时实现高效压缩的方法。

Method: ExGS框架包含两个核心组件：UGC执行无重优化的剪枝来大幅减少高斯基元，GaussPainter利用扩散先验和掩码引导细化来从严重剪枝的高斯场景中恢复高质量渲染。

Result: 该框架能够实现超过100倍的压缩（从典型的354.77 MB模型压缩到约3.31 MB），同时保持保真度，并在挑战性条件下显著改善图像质量。

Conclusion: 扩散先验在弥合极端压缩和高质量神经渲染之间的差距中发挥着核心作用。

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at
\href{https://github.com/chenttt2001/ExGS}{here}.

Method: 提出VTPerception-R1两阶段框架：第一阶段进行感知增强微调，第二阶段应用具有视觉、文本和一致性奖励的感知感知强化学习。

Result: 实验表明VTPerception-R1在多样化任务中显著提高了推理准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为感知基础的多模态推理提供了可扩展且可审计的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning
in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception
strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal
benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception,
especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples
perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning,
and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual,
textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1
significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks,
offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal
reasoning. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决现有跨视角地理定位方法在极端视角差异下因直接特征相似性匹配而忽略语义退化的问题，专注于在视角变化下实现鲁棒的特征检索。

Method: 1. Google检索增强模块对街景图像进行数据增强；2. 补丁感知特征聚合模块强调多局部特征聚合；3. 整合无人机多尺度图像构建的3D场景信息；4. 通过自监督和跨视角对比学习进行特征对齐。

Result: 在University-1652数据集上的UAVM2025挑战中实现了25.75%的Recall@1准确率，证明了在不同城市场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SkyLink方法通过创新的数据增强、特征聚合和3D场景整合，有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的视角差异问题，取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$
Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 in the UAVM2025 Challenge. Code will be

TL;DR: LOVE-R1通过自适应缩放机制解决长视频理解中时空感知的冲突，采用多步推理实现慢快自适应帧采样，在保持采样密度的同时提升帧分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LVLMs采用均匀帧采样机制，在长视频理解中难以同时兼顾时间线索和空间细节，导致次优解。需要解决时空感知的冲突问题。

Method: 提出自适应缩放机制：先用小分辨率密集采样，需要时放大感兴趣片段。通过多步推理实现，使用38k高质量CoT数据微调，并采用解耦强化微调优化内部缩放能力。

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中，LOVE-R1相比基线Qwen2.5-VL平均提升3.1%，实现了采样密度和帧分辨率之间的良好平衡。

Conclusion: 慢快自适应帧采样机制能有效解决长视频理解中的时空冲突问题，多步推理和明确优化缩放能力是关键成功因素。

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

Motivation: 理解多模态大语言模型中视觉功能的具体实现机制，探索如何更有效地利用这些发现来优化模型训练和应用。

Method: 提出视觉令牌交换分析框架，通过修改特定的KV缓存条目来精确揭示解码过程中的层特定功能。开发了VFL-LoRA（选择性训练视觉功能层）和VFL-select（基于功能层性能差异的数据自动分类）方法。

Result: 发现视觉功能在不同解码器层中分布，且顺序模式一致（识别→计数→定位）。VFL-LoRA优于全参数LoRA训练，防止功能遗忘。VFL-select能自动分类数据功能，仅用20%数据达到98%全数据性能，超越人工数据选择。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对MLLM视觉处理机制的理解，为创建更高效、可解释和鲁棒的模型提供了理论基础和实践方法。

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示工程而缺乏明确的因果结构，无法一致地将目标属性的因果效应传播到因果依赖项。

Method: 利用结构因果建模，结合两种属性正则化策略：提示对齐注入（将因果属性与文本嵌入对齐以实现精确语义控制）和条件令牌对比损失（解耦属性因子并减少虚假相关性）。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能，Pendulum数据集上MAE减少91%（精确属性控制），ADNI数据集上FID减少87%（高保真MRI图像生成）。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了稳健、可推广的反事实编辑，具有忠实的属性修改和强大的身份保持能力。

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D物体分类在计算机视觉、机器人和自动驾驶等领域具有重要应用价值，但由于点云的无序性、不规则性和噪声，实现高精度分类仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 将点云转换为体素化二值3D图像，提取区分性拓扑特征，然后使用轻量级一维卷积神经网络(1D CNN)进行训练。

Result: 在ModelNet40和ModelNet10数据集上分别达到99.05%和99.52%的准确率，在真实世界OmniObject3D数据集上表现稳健，对10种不同类型的损坏输入具有强韧性。

Conclusion: TACO-Net通过结合拓扑特征提取和轻量级CNN，实现了3D物体分类的最先进性能，并展现出优异的鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP2You是首个无需调参的解决方案，能够从极度不受约束的野外2D照片中重建高保真3D穿衣人像，支持任意姿态控制和免训练的多服装3D虚拟试穿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要"干净"的输入（如全身图像、最少遮挡或良好校准的跨视角捕捉），而UP2You旨在直接处理原始、非结构化的照片，这些照片可能在姿态、视角、裁剪和遮挡方面差异很大。

Method: 引入数据校正器范式，在单次前向传播中高效地将不受约束的输入转换为干净的正交多视角图像；核心是姿态相关特征聚合模块（PCFA），选择性融合多参考图像信息；还引入了基于感知器的多参考形状预测器，无需预捕获的身体模板。

Result: 在4D-Dress、PuzzleIOI和野外捕捉数据上的广泛实验表明，UP2You在几何精度（Chamfer-15%、P2S-18%）和纹理保真度（PSNR-21%、LPIPS-46%）方面持续超越先前方法。

Conclusion: UP2You高效（每人1.5分钟）且多功能，支持任意姿态控制和免训练的多服装3D虚拟试穿，使其适用于人类被随意捕捉的真实世界场景。

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

*Youngeun Kim,Youjia Zhang,Huiling Liu,Aecheon Jung,Sunwoo Lee,Sungeun Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的视觉语言模型token剪枝框架，通过零阶扰动估计token敏感性，在保持精度的同时显著提升推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型推理成本高，现有token剪枝方法存在注意力分数不稳定或多样性方法可能丢弃重要区域的问题

Method: 使用零阶扰动在投影层估计token敏感性，选择高敏感性且互补的视觉token，无需训练和反向传播

Result: 在多个VLMs和基准测试中优于现有方法，剪枝高达94.4%的token，保持精度同时实现2.30倍端到端推理加速

Conclusion: 该方法通过轻量级前向传递有效识别重要token，为视觉语言模型的高效推理提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

TL;DR: 提出PHASE-Net，一种基于流体动力学物理原理的轻量级rPPG模型，通过轴向交换器、自适应空间滤波器和门控TCN实现高效准确的非接触式心率监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有rPPG方法在头部运动和光照变化下精度下降，且深度学习方法缺乏理论依据，限制了鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 从Navier-Stokes方程推导rPPG物理模型，设计PHASE-Net包含：零FLOPs轴向交换器增强跨区域特征交互，自适应空间滤波器学习信号丰富区域，门控TCN建模长程时间动态。

Result: PHASE-Net在广泛实验中达到最先进性能，具有强效率和部署就绪性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了理论基础的rPPG解决方案，将物理原理与深度学习结合，实现了高效准确的非接触生理监测。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

TL;DR: 提出ELPG-DTFS，一种基于先验引导的自适应时频图神经网络，用于抑郁症的EEG诊断，在MODMA数据集上达到97.63%准确率和97.33% F1分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抑郁症诊断依赖主观量表，EEG作为低成本生物标志物，但现有深度模型将频谱视为静态图像、固定通道间图结构且忽略先验知识，限制了准确性和可解释性

Method: 提出ELPG-DTFS模型，包含：(1) 带跨频带互信息的通道-频带注意力机制，(2) 可学习邻接矩阵用于动态功能连接，(3) 残差知识图谱路径注入神经科学先验

Result: 在128通道MODMA数据集（53名受试者）上，ELPG-DTFS达到97.63%准确率和97.33% F1分数，超越2025年最先进的ACM-GNN模型。消融实验显示移除任何模块都会使F1降低高达4.35

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS为基于EEG的新一代抑郁症诊断提供了一个鲁棒且可解释的框架

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)
provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static
images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy
and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive
time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention
with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for
dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting
neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS
achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art
ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35,
confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and
interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类视觉系统的对比度增强和颜色对抗机制启发，探索生物动机的输入预处理方法，以提升语义分割在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 在RGB、灰度和对抗颜色通道上应用DoG滤波来增强局部对比度，这种预处理方法模型无关且轻量级。

Result: 在Cityscapes、ACDC和Dark Zurich数据集上的评估表明，该方法在保持分布内性能的同时，显著提升了在夜间、雾天和雪天等恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种模型无关的轻量级预处理方法有潜力集成到成像管道中，为安全关键环境中的下游视觉模型提供任务就绪的鲁棒输入。

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream
vision models in safety-critical environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在实时流媒体场景中的局限性，包括历史视觉特征存储限制和实时时空推理不足的问题。

Method: 提出持久事件记忆森林机制，基于时间距离、内容相似性和合并频率自适应组织视频帧为事件级树结构；引入细粒度时空窗口捕获短期视觉线索；创建OnlineIT指令调优数据集。

Result: 在StreamingBench上达到77.3%准确率，OVBench上60.5%，OVO-Bench上55.6%；在极端视觉token压缩(1024 tokens)下仍保持96.8%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: StreamForest在流媒体视频理解中展现出强大的鲁棒性、高效性和泛化能力，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于环境上下文的新型扩散模型，能够通过文本、元数据和视觉数据三种控制信号的任意组合来生成卫星图像。该方法首次将动态环境条件作为控制信号，并采用元数据融合策略处理部分损坏或缺失的观测数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在遥感领域面临显著限制：依赖有限的环境上下文、难以处理缺失或损坏数据、无法可靠反映用户意图。

Method: 开发了一种条件扩散模型，通过三种控制信号（文本、元数据、视觉数据）生成卫星图像，并引入元数据融合策略来建模属性嵌入交互以处理部分损坏或缺失的观测。

Result: 在单图像和时间序列生成试验中，该方法在定性和定量评估（使用6个不同指标）上均优于先前方法，表现出对缺失元数据的鲁棒性、对控制输入更高的响应性，以及更高的保真度、准确性和生成质量。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持了环境上下文条件化可以改进卫星图像基础模型性能的假设，该模型有望用于下游任务。收集的三模态数据集是首个公开可用的结合这三种不同媒介数据的资源。

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

TL;DR: 提出了ThermalGen模型，一种基于自适应流的生成模型，用于从RGB图像合成热成像图像，解决了RGB-热成像配对数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步校准的RGB-热成像配对数据稀缺，阻碍了视觉-热成像传感器融合和跨模态任务的发展，需要一种能够从丰富的RGB数据集合成热成像图像的方法。

Method: 采用自适应流生成模型，结合RGB图像条件架构和风格解耦机制，并构建了包含卫星-航空、航空和地面RGB-T配对数据的大规模数据集。

Result: 在多个RGB-T基准测试中，ThermalGen实现了与现有GAN和扩散方法相当或更优的翻译性能，能够合成反映视角、传感器特性和环境条件显著变化的热成像图像。

Conclusion: ThermalGen是首个能够合成反映多种变化因素的热成像图像的RGB-T图像翻译模型，为多模态图像对齐和检索等应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了车辆类型识别中的类别不平衡问题，通过合并多个数据集创建了16类约47k图像的语料库，并采用多种重采样方法和模型进行实验，发现深度模型在性能上具有优势，但少数类别识别仍是挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共数据集中严重的类别不平衡问题抑制了稀有类别的识别性能，这影响了智能交通和物流系统的准确性。

Method: 合并Kaggle、ImageNet和网络爬取数据创建16类语料库，使用SMOTE过采样和针对性欠采样创建6个平衡变体，比较轻量级集成方法（随机森林、AdaBoost、基于MobileNet-V2特征的软投票组合器）与可配置ResNet风格CNN的性能。

Result: 最佳集成方法（SMOTE组合）达到74.8%测试准确率，CNN在全测试集上达到79.19%，在未见推理批次上达到81.25%，证实了深度模型的优势。但最少数类别（驳船）仍是失败模式。

Conclusion: 仅靠重采样方法存在局限性，建议优先收集更多少数类别数据、使用成本敏感目标（如焦点损失），并探索混合集成或CNN管道以结合可解释性和表示能力。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and
logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance
on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2
features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with
strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure
mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest
prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives
(e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine
interpretability with representational power.

Motivation: 解决MRI质量评估中的数据稀缺和协议变异性问题，克服传统方法在定量指标和语义理解之间的权衡。

Method: 结合三个关键创新：通过MRQy增强模拟伪影的稳健指标提取、使用Qwen将指标转化为问答对、通过LoRA高效融合LLaVA-OneVision。

Result: 在MR-ART、FastMRI和MyConnectome基准测试中达到最先进性能，具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过桥接定量分析与语义推理，生成临床可解释的输出，增强动态医疗环境中的质量控制。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VagueGAN是一种针对生成模型的攻击方法，通过组合扰动网络和生成器-判别器对来制作隐蔽的触发信号，在保持视觉质量的同时实现对生成图像的针对性改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然对抗攻击在判别模型中被广泛研究，但针对生成管道的攻击研究较少，特别是那些输入微小扰动就能导致输出受控变化的攻击。

Method: 结合模块化扰动网络PoisonerNet与生成器-判别器对，制作隐蔽触发信号，并通过ControlNet引导编辑评估在扩散模型上的可迁移性。

Result: 中毒输出相比干净输出可能具有更高的视觉质量，挑战了中毒必然降低保真度的假设；潜在空间中毒可以保留甚至增强输出美学效果。

Conclusion: 精心优化的扰动可以在保持视觉隐蔽性的同时对生成器输出产生一致的影响，这对图像生成管道的完整性提出了担忧。

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

Motivation: 稀疏视图下的新视角合成存在过拟合、几何失真和场景恢复不完整的问题，3D高斯溅射在稀疏输入下会出现浮动伪影和结构不一致。

Method: 提出混合损失深度估计模块（结合重投影、点传播和平滑约束）、双向扭曲虚拟视图合成方法（生成虚拟训练视图）、遮挡感知重建组件（使用深度差异掩码和学习型修复模型）。

Result: 在LLFF、Blender和DTU基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，最高PSNR 21.13 dB，LPIPS 0.189，同时保持实时推理能力。

Conclusion: DWGS通过整合结构线索、虚拟视图约束和遮挡区域补全，有效提升了稀疏视图下的3D高斯溅射性能，实现了高质量的实时新视角合成。

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

Motivation: 现有方法将ViL模型和数据监督视为独立来源，缺乏有效融合，限制了知识迁移效果

Method: DAM框架初始化稳定的ViL引导目标，采用双向蒸馏机制在迭代适应过程中促进目标模型与双重监督之间的知识交换

Result: 在多个SFADA基准测试和主动学习策略中持续优于现有方法，达到新的最先进水平

Conclusion: DAM框架通过有效融合多模态监督和人工标注，显著提升了源自由主动域自适应的性能

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art
across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于青少年特发性脊柱侧弯评估的新型深度学习框架，能够同时预测每个椎体的上下终板角度和中点坐标，通过SVD分析椎体形态直接计算角度，无需预设曲线模式，并在630张全脊柱X光片上取得了83.45%的诊断准确率和2.55°的平均绝对误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年特发性脊柱侧弯是常见的脊柱畸形，传统手动测量Cobb角存在显著的观察者间变异性，影响诊断准确性。现有自动化方法使用简化的脊柱模型和预设曲线模式，无法应对临床复杂性。

Method: 结合HRNet主干网络和Swin-Transformer模块，加入生物力学约束增强特征提取。使用奇异值分解直接分析椎体形态的角度预测，灵活检测多样化的脊柱侧弯模式。引入椎体楔形指数量化椎体变形。

Result: 在630张10-18岁患者的全脊柱X光片上，方法达到83.45%的诊断准确率和2.55°的平均绝对误差。框架在分布外病例上表现出优异的泛化能力。纵向分析显示VWI与曲线进展有显著预后相关性，而传统Cobb角无相关性。

Conclusion: 该框架为早期AIS检测、个性化治疗规划和进展监测提供了有力支持，椎体楔形指数显示出比传统Cobb角更好的预后价值。

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

*Mohsen Ghafoorian,Denis Korzhenkov,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Attention Surgery框架，通过线性化或混合化注意力机制，在预训练视频扩散模型中实现亚二次复杂度，减少40%注意力计算成本，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视频扩散模型虽然生成质量优秀，但自注意力机制的二次计算成本限制了长序列和高分辨率视频的生成效率。现有线性注意力方法无法匹配softmax注意力的表达能力且需要昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 结合软注意力和线性注意力的混合注意力机制，配合轻量级蒸馏和微调流程，仅需少量GPU训练时间。采用成本感知的块率策略在不同层级平衡表达能力和效率。

Result: 在Wan2.1 1.3B模型上应用，实现了首个具有竞争力的亚二次注意力视频扩散模型，在VBench和VBench-2.0基准测试中保持生成质量的同时，注意力计算成本降低40%。

Conclusion: Attention Surgery框架成功地在不从头训练的情况下，将预训练视频扩散模型的注意力机制线性化，显著提升了计算效率，为长序列和高分辨率视频生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery
achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models,
reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining
generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了OpenGPT-4o-Image数据集，通过分层任务分类和自动化数据生成方法构建，显著提升了多模态模型的图像生成和编辑性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏系统结构和真实世界应用所需的挑战性场景，限制了统一多模态模型的性能发展。

Method: 采用分层任务分类法结合自动化数据生成流程，利用结构化资源池和GPT-4o生成8万对高质量指令-图像对，涵盖11个主要领域和51个子任务。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升：编辑任务提升18%（UniWorld-V1在ImgEdit-Bench），生成任务提升13%（Harmon在GenEval）。

Conclusion: 系统化的数据构建是推进多模态AI能力的关键因素。

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

TL;DR: SID是一种目标导向的语言引导导航学习方法，通过自我改进的演示来提升智能体在未知环境中的探索能力，在多个导航任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用最短路径轨迹，缺乏有效的探索先验来训练导航智能体，导致在未知环境中导航到指定目标的能力不足。

Method: SID首先在环境采样的最短路径数据上训练初始智能体，然后利用该智能体生成新颖的探索轨迹。这些新颖的轨迹提供更强的探索策略演示，用于训练更好的智能体，形成迭代自我改进的管道。

Result: 在REVERIE和SOON等目标导向语言引导导航任务中，SID显著提升了探索能力和泛化性能，在SOON未见验证集上达到50.9%的成功率，比先前领先方法高出13.9%。

Conclusion: SID的迭代自我改进管道能够扩展到新环境，生成的演示可以跨多种语言引导导航任务迁移，有效提升了目标导向导航任务的性能上限。

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

TL;DR: 提出Seg-CFT方法，用于生成结构特定的反事实图像，避免传统方法在干预结构特定变量时产生的全局不良影响，无需用户提供繁琐的像素级标签图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实图像生成方法依赖外部分类器或回归器进行主体级干预，但在结构特定干预（如改变左肺面积）时效果不足，会产生不希望的全局影响，且需要用户提供繁琐的假设分割图。

Method: 提出Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT)方法，在保持对结构特定标量变量干预简单性的同时，生成局部一致且有效的反事实图像。

Result: 成功生成逼真的胸部X光片，并在冠状动脉疾病建模方面显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: Seg-CFT方法能够有效生成结构特定的反事实图像，避免了传统方法的局限性，在医学图像分析中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

TL;DR: 本文研究了GAN的可扩展性，通过在VAE潜在空间中训练并使用纯transformer架构，提出了GAT模型，在ImageNet-256上实现了2.96的FID，仅需40个epoch。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成对抗网络的可扩展性，借鉴其他生成模型的有效设计选择，解决GAN在规模化训练中出现的问题。

Method: 在VAE潜在空间中训练，采用纯transformer生成器和判别器，通过轻量级中间监督和宽度感知学习率调整解决扩展问题。

Result: GAT-XL/2在ImageNet-256上实现了2.96的FID，仅需40个epoch，比基线方法少6倍训练时间。

Conclusion: GAN可以通过适当的架构设计和训练策略实现有效扩展，纯transformer架构在潜在空间中的GAN训练具有良好可扩展性。

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

TL;DR: CogniGPT是一个基于人类渐进视觉认知的长视频理解框架，通过多粒度感知代理和验证增强反思代理的交互循环，实现高效可靠的视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频具有时间复杂性和任务相关信息稀疏的特点，现有LLM方法在捕捉任务关键信息时难以兼顾完整性和效率。

Method: 采用多粒度感知代理模拟人类视觉注意机制捕捉任务相关信息，验证增强反思代理验证关键线索以减少幻觉并优化感知策略，通过交互循环探索最小化的可靠任务线索集。

Result: 在EgoSchema、Video-MME、NExT-QA和MovieChat数据集上的实验表明，CogniGPT在准确性和效率方面均表现优越，在EgoSchema上仅使用11.2帧就超越了现有无训练方法，性能可与Gemini 1.5-Pro相媲美。

Conclusion: CogniGPT通过模拟人类渐进视觉认知的交互框架，有效解决了长视频理解中的完整性和效率平衡问题，为AI系统处理复杂长视频提供了新思路。

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像等高风险领域需要精确的置信度估计，过度自信的错误分类可能带来严重后果。

Method: 构建自定义CNN并在合并的脑MRI数据集上训练，引入五种图像噪声模拟真实不确定性，使用温度缩放进行后处理校准。

Result: 在所有噪声条件下，温度缩放显著降低了预期校准误差(ECE)和负对数似然(NLL)，同时不降低分类准确率。

Conclusion: 温度缩放是一种有效且计算效率高的方法，能增强医学AI系统的决策置信度，使模型输出在噪声或不确定环境下更加可靠。

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

TL;DR: 提出了Social 3D Scene Graphs，一种增强的3D场景图表示，用于捕捉人类及其与环境的关系，并引入了包含全面人-场景关系注释的新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法大多忽略场景中的人类，且缺乏标注的人-环境关系数据，限制了机器人对社会合规和上下文感知行为的理解能力。

Method: 开发了增强的3D场景图表示，使用开放词汇框架捕捉人类属性、活动以及与环境的局部和远程关系，并创建了包含多样化查询的新基准。

Result: 实验表明，该表示方法提高了人类活动预测能力，并改善了人-环境关系的推理性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发具有社会智能的机器人铺平了道路，通过更好地理解人类在环境中的互动关系。

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

TL;DR: 提出基于跨模态融合注意力和自监督多事件表示学习的事件相机面部关键点对齐框架，解决事件数据空间信息有限和标注数据缺乏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在低光照和快速运动条件下具有优势，但现有RGB方法在事件数据上表现不佳，且仅用事件数据训练效果不理想，缺乏标注数据集也阻碍了进展。

Method: 使用跨模态融合注意力(CMFA)整合RGB数据指导特征提取，同时采用自监督多事件表示学习(SSMER)从无标签事件数据中学习有效特征。

Result: 在真实事件数据集E-SIE和合成事件数据集WFLW-V上的实验表明，该方法在多个评估指标上持续超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过跨模态融合和自监督学习有效解决了事件相机面部关键点对齐中的空间信息有限和标注数据缺乏问题，取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法在BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1成人胶质瘤分割任务中排名第一，证明了在线数据增强策略在脑肿瘤分割中的有效性。

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This

Conclusion: Wan-Alpha框架在RGBA视频生成方面取得了显著进展，模型已公开发布。

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent
transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of
applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting
their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new
framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha
channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that
encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of
semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as
hair strands. The released model is available on our website:

Motivation: 预训练扩散模型提供了丰富的多尺度潜在特征，但它们在结构化输出（如人体姿态估计）方面的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 1. 直接在SD U-Net的潜在空间预测关键点热图；2. 通过轻量级卷积姿态头将潜在特征映射到关键点热图；3. 加入辅助RGB重建分支以增强域外鲁棒性。

Result: 仅使用Sapiens五分之一的训练时间，在COCO验证集上与Sapiens-1B/2B持平，在HumanArt和COCO-OOD跨域基准上达到新的SOTA。

Conclusion: SDPose展示了预训练扩散模型在结构化预测任务中的强大潜力，并能作为零样本姿态标注器用于下游可控生成任务。

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

Motivation: 现有方法存在视野范围有限或相机可控性不足的问题，限制了连续完整场景的合成和自由探索能力。

Method: 首先在虚拟3D环境中构建大规模全景视频-探索路径数据集，然后引入球面感知扩散变换器架构，将等距柱面特征重投影到球面以建模几何邻接关系。

Result: 实验表明PanoWorld-X在运动范围、控制精度和视觉质量等方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架在真实世界应用中具有巨大潜力，能够生成高质量可控的全景视频。

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

Method: 使用局部视图Transformer，仅处理每个视图周围局部邻域的信息，采用基于相对几何变换的新型位置编码，并解码为包含颜色和透明度视角依赖的3D高斯泼溅场景表示。

Result: 能够单次前向传播重建任意大规模、高分辨率场景，避免了二次注意力操作的需求。

Conclusion: LVT架构成功解决了Transformer在大规模3D场景重建中的可扩展性问题，为高效的大场景视觉处理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

*Max Curie,Paulo da Costa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLASP是一个无需标注数据或微调的轻量级无监督图像分割框架，使用自监督ViT编码器提取特征，通过谱聚类和自适应参数选择实现分割，在COCO Stuff和ADE20K上达到竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为大型未标注数据集（如数字广告和营销工作流中的品牌安全筛查、创意资产管理和社交媒体内容审核）提供简单可复现的无监督分割基线方法。

Method: 使用自监督ViT（DINO）提取补丁特征，构建亲和矩阵并应用谱聚类，通过特征间隙轮廓搜索自动选择分割数量，使用全连接DenseCRF锐化边界。

Result: 在COCO Stuff和ADE20K数据集上获得了竞争性的mIoU和像素精度，与近期无监督基线方法表现相当。

Conclusion: CLASP的零训练设计使其成为处理大型未标注语料库的强大、易于复现的基线方法，特别适用于数字广告和营销工作流。

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such
as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content
moderation

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,
change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware
reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task
aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to
diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for
remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness.
Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance
gains over state of the art generic and specialized vision language models.

TL;DR: 提出了STAGE框架，通过优势/KL重加权和熵奖励来解决GRPO在自回归图像生成中的不稳定性和泛化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO算法应用于自回归图像模型时存在训练不稳定、破坏预训练模型能力、图像质量下降和泛化能力差的问题

Method: 引入STAGE框架，包含两个关键解决方案：1）优势/KL重加权-相似性感知重加权缓解冲突更新；2）熵奖励-基于参考模型的熵奖励稳定学习

Result: 实验表明STAGE在多个基准测试中持续改善视觉质量、稳定性和跨任务泛化能力

Conclusion: STAGE通过缓解token间冲突和稳定训练，减少对预训练分布的破坏，改善泛化能力并更好地迁移到其他基准测试

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

TL;DR: 提出VT-FSL框架，通过大语言模型构建跨模态提示，结合几何感知对齐实现少样本学习，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有少样本学习方法因缺乏实际实例基础而产生的语义幻觉问题，避免噪声引导和昂贵修正。

Method: 包含跨模态迭代提示(CIP)和跨模态几何对齐(CGA)。CIP基于类名和支持图像迭代生成精确类别描述，CGA通过最小化三维平行多面体核化体积来对齐文本、支持和合成视觉表示。

Result: 在十个多样化基准测试中建立了新的最先进性能，涵盖标准、跨域和细粒度少样本学习场景。

Conclusion: VT-FSL通过精确的跨模态提示和几何感知对齐，有效解决了少样本学习中的语义幻觉问题，实现了优越的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available
at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像配准是生物医学和生命科学中的基本逆问题，但现有算法未能跟上图像采集能力的发展速度，需要解决大规模配准的计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出IO感知的非GEMM融合内核，结合分布式框架，优化非GEMM瓶颈，实现卷积感知的张量分片，补充现有的模型并行技术。

Result: 在8个A6000 GPU上1分钟内完成100微米分辨率人脑MRI体积的多模态配准，加速现有配准流程6-7倍，降低峰值内存消耗20-59%，单GPU可处理比现有SOTA大64倍的问题。

Conclusion: FFDP框架实现了前所未有的图像配准规模能力，显著提升了配准性能和效率，为大规模生物医学图像分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

TL;DR: GEM是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的冷冻电镜重建框架，在真实空间中直接操作，通过紧凑的3D高斯表示蛋白质，显著降低了内存占用和训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜数据集规模巨大，传统傅里叶空间方法效率高但保真度低，而基于神经辐射场的真实空间方法精度高但内存和计算开销大，需要一种兼顾效率和精度的解决方案。

Method: 使用3D高斯泼溅技术，用仅需11个参数的小型3D高斯表示蛋白质密度，设计了新的梯度计算方法，减少每个体素贡献的高斯计算。

Result: 在标准冷冻电镜基准测试中，GEM比最先进方法训练速度提升48%，内存使用降低12%，局部分辨率提高38.8%。

Conclusion: GEM为冷冻电镜重建提供了一个实用且可扩展的范式，统一了速度、效率和高分辨率精度。

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision.
Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their
robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image

geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground
truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation
model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates
teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust
training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE
to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in
complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth
features. Code and models are available at

Conclusion: UniLat3D通过统一的潜在表示和单阶段生成流程，有效解决了传统两阶段方法的局限性，实现了高效高质量的3D资产生成。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&
code are available at https://unilat3d.github.io/

TL;DR: MANI-Pure是一种基于扩散模型的对抗净化框架，通过自适应频率噪声注入来有效抑制对抗扰动，在保持高清洁精度的同时显著提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法使用均匀噪声注入，会破坏语义结构并削弱鲁棒性。研究发现对抗扰动主要集中在高频区域，且在不同频率和攻击类型中呈现异质性强度模式。

Method: 提出MANI-Pure框架，利用输入的幅度谱指导净化过程，自适应地应用异质性、频率目标噪声，有效抑制脆弱高频、低幅度频段中的对抗扰动，同时保留语义关键的低频内容。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，MANI-Pure将清洁精度差距缩小到原始分类器的0.59以内，同时将鲁棒精度提升2.15，在RobustBench排行榜上达到top-1鲁棒精度，超越先前最先进方法。

Conclusion: MANI-Pure通过频率自适应噪声注入策略，有效解决了对抗净化中的关键挑战，在保持高清洁精度的同时显著提升了模型的鲁棒防御能力。

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

Motivation: 扩散模型生成质量高但采样速度慢，流匹配与扩散模型在理论上是等价的，但不确定蒸馏技术是否可以直接迁移到流匹配模型

Method: 基于贝叶斯规则和条件期望的简单推导，将分数蒸馏扩展到预训练文本到图像流匹配模型，包括SANA、SD3-Medium、SD3.5-Medium/Large和FLUX.1-dev等DiT骨干模型

Result: 实验表明，只需对流匹配和DiT进行适度调整，SiD就能在这些模型上开箱即用，在无数据和有数据辅助设置下都有效，无需教师微调或架构更改

Conclusion: 分数蒸馏技术广泛适用于文本到图像流匹配模型，解决了之前关于稳定性和合理性的担忧，统一了扩散和流匹配生成器的加速技术

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有医学推理基准主要关注单次就诊图像分析，与现实临床实践中医生参考患者历史情况进行综合评估的做法不符，需要评估模型在时序医学图像上的推理能力。

Result: 大多数模型缺乏分析时序医学图像中患者病情变化的能力，在闭卷设置下大量模型表现仅达到随机猜测水平；GPT o3、o4-mini和Claude 3.5 Sonnet表现相对较好但仍有不足；多模态检索增强比无检索和仅文本检索带来更显著的性能提升，VQA任务平均提升2.59%。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了LVLMs在时序医学图像推理方面的局限性，并表明多模态检索增强是解决这一挑战的有前景方向。

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

*Richeek Das,Kostas Daniilidis,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Fast Feature Field (F³)方法，通过预测未来事件来学习事件相机的数据表示，能够高效处理稀疏事件数据并保持场景结构和运动信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够处理事件相机稀疏数据、抗噪声且适应不同事件率的表示方法，以支持多种下游视觉任务。

Method: 利用多分辨率哈希编码和深度集合思想，将连续时空体积内的事件表示为多通道图像，实现高效计算（HD分辨率120Hz，VGA分辨率440Hz）。

Result: 在三个机器人平台（汽车、四足机器人、飞行平台）上，在不同光照条件（白天、夜晚）、环境（室内、室外、城市、越野）和动态视觉传感器下，在光流估计、语义分割和单目深度估计任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: F³方法能够高效处理事件相机数据，在多种视觉任务中表现出色，实现25-75Hz的HD分辨率预测能力。

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

*Zhaozhi Wang,Tong Zhang,Mingyue Guo,Yaowei Wang,Qixiang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAnchor是一个即插即用的模块，利用子空间亲和性来增强跨帧的视觉线索，无需重新训练即可将注意力锚定到共享的视觉结构上，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉空间推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言对齐方面取得了显著进展，但在视觉空间推理方面仍然存在局限。研究发现这种限制源于注意力机制：视觉标记被语言标记所掩盖，导致模型无法在跨帧中一致地识别相同的视觉线索。

Method: 作者在稀疏子空间聚类中的自表达性与Transformer中的注意力机制之间建立了新颖联系，提出了VideoAnchor模块。该模块利用子空间亲和性来强化跨帧的视觉线索，无需重新训练即可将注意力锚定到共享的视觉结构上。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干模型上的广泛实验显示了一致的性能提升：在VSI-Bench和Video-MME（空间相关任务）上，使用InternVL2-8B和Qwen2.5VL-72B分别获得了3.2%和4.6%的改进。定性分析展示了更一致的子空间划分和更强的视觉基础。

Conclusion: VideoAnchor通过将注意力机制与子空间聚类理论相结合，有效解决了多模态大语言模型在视觉空间推理中的局限性，为提升视频理解能力提供了一种高效且无需重新训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at
https://github.com/feufhd/VideoAnchor.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSM8K-V是一个纯视觉多图像数学推理基准，通过将文本基准GSM8K系统性地转换为视觉形式构建，包含1319个高质量样本，用于评估视觉语言模型在视觉数学推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉数学推理基准主要局限于几何问题，缺乏数学文字问题的覆盖，且很少评估多图像推理能力。为了填补这些空白，需要开发一个更全面的视觉数学推理基准。

Method: 通过精心设计的自动化图像生成流程结合细致的人工标注，将广泛使用的文本基准GSM8K系统性地映射为视觉形式，构建了包含1319个高质量样本的GSM8K-V基准。

Result: 评估结果显示，现有视觉语言模型在文本GSM8K上性能接近饱和（最佳模型准确率95.22%），但在GSM8K-V上仍有很大提升空间（最佳模型准确率仅46.93%）。

Conclusion: GSM8K-V为视觉数学推理提供了新视角，并建立了指导开发更鲁棒和泛化性更强的视觉语言模型的基准。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出Rolling Forcing技术，通过联合去噪、注意力池和高效训练算法，解决流式视频生成中的误差累积问题，实现实时生成长视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式视频生成方法存在严重误差累积问题，导致长时视频质量显著下降，需要一种能抑制误差传播的技术。

Method: 1. 联合去噪方案：同时去噪多帧，放宽相邻帧间的严格因果关系；2. 注意力池机制：保留初始帧作为全局上下文锚点；3. 高效训练算法：在扩展去噪窗口上进行少步蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明Rolling Forcing能在单GPU上实时生成多分钟视频，显著减少误差累积。

Conclusion: Rolling Forcing通过三项创新设计有效解决了流式视频生成中的误差累积问题，实现了高质量、低延迟的长视频流生成。

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种将预训练视觉编码器对齐为潜在扩散模型图像生成分词器的方法，通过三阶段对齐策略建立语义丰富的潜在空间，加速扩散模型收敛并提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统从零训练VAE主要关注低层细节，而预训练基础编码器具有丰富的语义结构，可以更好地服务于图像生成任务。

Method: 三阶段对齐策略：1) 冻结编码器，训练适配器和解码器建立语义潜在空间；2) 联合优化所有组件并添加语义保持损失；3) 精炼解码器提升重建质量。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，分词器加速扩散模型收敛，64个epoch内达到gFID 1.90；在LAION上，2B参数文本到图像模型在相同训练步数下持续优于FLUX VAE。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，为连续分词器设计建立了语义基础范式，能够产生语义丰富的图像分词器，有益于扩散模型。

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

TL;DR: PICO是一个基于扩散变换器的视觉上下文学习框架，通过单个标注样本就能推断变换规则并应用于新输入，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模型在预定义任务上表现良好，但难以处理用户自定义的个性化视觉任务。现有方法依赖昂贵的微调或合成数据，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出四面板框架PICO，利用扩散变换器作为视觉上下文学习器。构建VisRel多样化调优数据集，并引入注意力引导的种子评分器提升可靠性。

Result: PICO在实验中超越微调和合成数据基线，能灵活适应新颖的用户定义任务，并在识别和生成任务上都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 任务多样性而非数据规模驱动了鲁棒泛化，PICO为个性化视觉任务提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

TL;DR: 提出LayerCD方法，通过对比视觉编码器浅层和深层特征生成的输出分布来减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型经常产生与输入图像内容不一致的幻觉输出，特别是浅层视觉特征更容易导致幻觉，因为它们只捕获有偏见的低层次信息。

Method: LayerCD方法对比视觉编码器浅层和深层特征生成的输出分布，过滤掉由浅层特征引起的幻觉。

Result: 在两个幻觉基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LayerCD显著优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: LayerCD通过层次对比解码有效减少了多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，证明了浅层和深层视觉特征对比的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at
https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .

TL;DR: GHOST方法通过优化图像嵌入空间生成诱导多模态大语言模型产生物体幻觉的图像，成功率超过28%，远高于现有方法的1%，并能发现模型间的可转移漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究多模态大语言模型物体幻觉的基准测试使用固定视觉场景，无法发现模型特定或未预见的幻觉漏洞，需要一种主动生成诱导幻觉图像的方法。

Method: GHOST方法在图像嵌入空间进行优化，误导模型同时保持目标对象不存在，然后引导扩散模型基于该嵌入生成自然图像，引入微妙误导线索。

Result: 在包括GLM-4.1V-Thinking在内的多个模型上实现超过28%的幻觉成功率，为Qwen2.5-VL优化的图像在GPT-4o上诱导幻觉率达66.5%，生成图像质量高且无目标对象。

Conclusion: GHOST可作为诊断和纠正工具，通过在其生成图像上微调可减轻幻觉问题，有助于构建更可靠的多模态系统。

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

TL;DR: DC-Gen是一个通过深度压缩潜在空间来加速文本到图像扩散模型的通用框架，无需从头训练，通过后训练流程保持基础模型质量，显著提升4K图像生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在生成高质量图像方面表现出色，但在扩展到高分辨率（如4K）时面临显著的效率挑战，且现有研究很少处理潜在空间内的固有冗余问题。

Method: 使用后训练流程，首先通过轻量级嵌入对齐训练桥接基础模型潜在空间与深度压缩潜在空间之间的表示差距，然后仅需少量LoRA微调即可解锁基础模型的生成质量。

Result: 在SANA和FLUX.1-Krea上验证有效，DC-Gen-FLUX在NVIDIA H100 GPU上将4K图像生成延迟降低53倍，结合NVFP4 SVDQuant后，在单个NVIDIA 5090 GPU上仅需3.5秒生成4K图像，总延迟相比基础FLUX.1-Krea模型降低138倍。

Conclusion: DC-Gen框架能够在不牺牲生成质量的前提下，显著加速文本到图像扩散模型，特别是在高分辨率图像生成场景下表现出卓越的效率提升。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

Conclusion: DC-VideoGen为视频扩散模型提供了高效的后训练加速方案，显著提升效率并扩展应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for
efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video
diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression
latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key
innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal
temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained
Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100
GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理包含显著对象变形、大尺度相机运动和有限视角覆盖的长视频序列，这限制了实际应用中的动态场景理解和3D内容创建。

Method: 训练个性化的对象中心姿态估计器，通过预训练的图像到3D模型进行监督，指导可变形3D高斯表示的优化，并使用长期2D点跟踪进行正则化。

Result: 在具有挑战性的场景中，PAD3R能够重建高保真、可关节化的3D表示，展现出良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PAD3R为动态场景理解和3D内容创建提供了有前景的解决方案，能够以类别无关的方式处理复杂的变形对象重建任务。

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

TL;DR: FlashI2V是一种新的图像到视频生成方法，通过潜在偏移和傅里叶引导来解决条件图像泄漏问题，在域外数据上实现了最佳泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有I2V方法存在条件图像泄漏问题，导致运动缓慢、颜色不一致等性能下降，并且在域外场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出FlashI2V方法，包含：(1)潜在偏移：从噪声潜在中减去条件图像信息，隐式地融入条件；(2)傅里叶引导：使用傅里叶变换的高频幅度特征加速收敛并调整生成视频的细节水平。

Result: 实验结果表明，FlashI2V有效克服了条件图像泄漏问题，在Vbench-I2V上动态度得分达到53.01，超越了更大的模型如CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V和Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P。

Conclusion: FlashI2V仅用1.3B参数就实现了最先进的I2V生成性能，特别是在域外数据上表现出优异的泛化能力。

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is
