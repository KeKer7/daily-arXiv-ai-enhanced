### [1] [Facial Emotion Recognition does not detect feeling unsafe in automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04490)
*Abel van Elburg,Konstantinos Gkentsidis,Mathieu Sarrazin,Sarah Barendswaard,Varun Kotian,Riender Happee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究通过驾驶模拟器实验分析自动驾驶车辆中乘客的风险感知，发现动态驾驶风格和行人横穿会增加不适感，面部表情识别不可靠，而基于车辆运动和皮肤电导的神经网络模型能有效预测风险感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信任和感知安全对自动驾驶车辆的公众接受度至关重要，需要理解乘客在自动驾驶过程中的风险感知机制。

Method: 使用驾驶模拟器进行实验，32名参与者体验两种自动驾驶风格（动态vs平静）和行人横穿场景，收集主观舒适度评分、运动数据、面部表情、皮肤电导、心率和眼动数据。

Result: 动态驾驶风格引起更强不适感；行人横穿使动态驾驶风格的不适感加倍；面部表情识别不可靠（仅9/24人有反应，其中8人显示快乐表情）；基于车辆运动和皮肤电导的神经网络模型能很好预测风险感知。

Conclusion: 面部表情识别不适合评估自动驾驶风险感知，而车辆运动和生理信号结合的神经网络模型为客观风险评估提供了有效方法，减少了主观偏差。

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [2] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer是一个通用的提示词重写框架，通过强化学习训练Chain-of-Thought重写器，配合专门的奖励模型AlignEvaluator，显著提升文本到图像生成模型对复杂提示词的理解和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂用户提示时存在属性绑定、否定和组合关系等方面的困难，导致用户意图与生成结果之间存在显著不匹配。

Method: 提出PromptEnhancer框架，通过强化学习训练Chain-of-Thought重写器，使用基于24个关键点的系统分类法训练的AlignEvaluator奖励模型提供细粒度反馈，优化提示词重写。

Result: 在HunyuanImage 2.1模型上的广泛实验表明，PromptEnhancer在广泛的语义和组合挑战中显著提高了图像-文本对齐度。

Conclusion: 该框架无需修改预训练模型的权重即可提升任何文本到图像模型的表现，并引入了新的人类偏好基准来促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext是一个2B参数的DiT模型，基于SD3.5-Medium架构改进，通过渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)和大规模预训练，在图像生成和编辑任务上达到SOTA性能，并扩展到统一多模态框架UniPic2-Metaquery。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源多模态模型过于注重参数规模扩展而忽视训练策略优化，限制了效率和性能。需要开发更高效的训练方法来提升模型能力。

Method: 1) 对SD3.5-Medium进行架构改进和大规模高质量数据预训练；2) 提出渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)分阶段增强指令跟随和编辑一致性；3) 通过连接器将图像模型与Qwen2.5-VL-7B连接进行联合训练。

Result: 模型在图像生成和编辑能力上超越了参数规模更大的BAGEL(7B)和Flux-Kontext(12B)模型。UniPic2-Metaquery在多种任务上达到顶级性能，验证了训练范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的Skywork UniPic 2.0训练范式通过优化的架构设计和渐进式强化策略，实现了高效的多模态模型训练，证明了参数效率与性能可以兼得。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [4] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag是一个基于像素空间双向扭曲和图像修复的实时拖拽式图像编辑框架，相比现有方法显著提升了交互体验和编辑精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拖拽式图像编辑方法主要依赖生成模型的潜在空间操作，存在精度有限、反馈延迟和模型特定约束等问题

Method: 将拖拽编辑分解为像素空间双向扭曲和图像修复两个步骤，将图像区域视为可变形材料，通过弹性物体变形原理实现自然形状保持

Result: 在512x512分辨率下实现实时扭曲预览(0.01秒)和高效修复(0.3秒)，相比需要数分钟编辑的现有方法显著提升交互体验

Conclusion: 该方法可作为通用适配器兼容任何修复模型，无需架构修改即可自动继承未来修复技术的所有改进，在视觉质量和精确控制方面表现优异

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [5] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH是首个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，采用"再生与修正"策略，通过扩散模型生成良性图像来消除对抗性补丁攻击，无需先验知识即可有效防御多种攻击类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的物体检测器仍然容易受到对抗性补丁攻击，这些攻击可以隐藏真实物体或创建虚假物体，造成严重后果。现有防御方法需要针对特定攻击设计，缺乏通用性和对自适应攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DISPATCH框架：1）利用扩散模型的分布内生成能力重新生成整个图像；2）通过修正过程识别并替换对抗性区域为重新生成的良性对应部分。该方法与攻击无关，不需要现有补丁的先验知识。

Result: 在多个检测器和攻击上的广泛实验表明，DISPATCH在隐藏攻击上达到89.3%的最佳mAP.5分数，在非目标创建攻击上将攻击成功率降低至24.8%，始终优于最先进的防御方法。

Conclusion: DISPATCH对自适应攻击保持强鲁棒性，是物体检测系统实用可靠的防御方案，为对抗性补丁防御提供了新的生成式方法范式。

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

### [6] [WATCH: World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04600)
*Qijun Ying,Zhongyuan Hu,Rui Zhang,Ronghui Li,Yu Lu,Zijiao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH是一个从单目视频重建全局人体运动的统一框架，通过角度分解和轨迹整合机制解决了相机方向信息和位移线索的利用问题，在野外基准测试中达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单目视频重建全局人体运动时的深度模糊、运动模糊以及相机与人体运动纠缠等挑战，特别是现有方法在利用相机方向信息和整合相机位移线索方面的不足。

Method: 提出WATCH框架，包含解析性航向角分解技术和受世界模型启发的相机轨迹整合机制，能够高效利用相机方向信息并有效整合相机位移线索。

Result: 在野外基准测试中实现了端到端轨迹重建的最先进性能，证明了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决相机位移整合这一长期挑战提供了新见解，证明了联合建模方法的有效性，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

### [7] [Sali4Vid: Saliency-Aware Video Reweighting and Adaptive Caption Retrieval for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04602)
*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid是一个简单有效的显著性感知框架，通过视频重加权和自适应字幕检索来解决密集视频字幕任务中的两个关键问题，在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上达到了最先进的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端模型存在两个局限性：(1)仅对文本应用时间戳监督，而将所有视频帧同等对待；(2)从固定大小的视频块中检索字幕，忽略了场景转换。

Method: 提出Sali4Vid框架，包含两个核心组件：显著性感知视频重加权（将时间戳标注转换为基于sigmoid的帧重要性权重）和基于语义的自适应字幕检索（通过帧相似性分割视频以捕捉场景转换并改进字幕检索）。

Result: 在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 联合改进视频加权和检索对密集视频字幕任务具有显著益处，Sali4Vid框架简单而有效。

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

### [9] [VCMamba: Bridging Convolutions with Multi-Directional Mamba for Efficient Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04669)
*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba是一个结合CNN局部特征提取能力和Mamba SSM全局建模能力的新型视觉骨干网络，在ImageNet和ADE20K上取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决ViT和SSM在细粒度局部特征捕获方面的不足，以及CNN缺乏全局推理能力的问题，需要融合CNN和Mamba SSM的优势

Method: 采用卷积stem和分层结构，早期阶段使用卷积块提取局部特征，后期阶段使用多方向Mamba块建模长距离依赖和全局上下文，保持线性复杂度

Result: VCMamba-B在ImageNet-1K达到82.6% top-1准确率，超越PlainMamba-L3 0.3%且参数减少37%；在ADE20K达到47.1 mIoU，超越EfficientFormer-L7 2.0 mIoU且参数减少62%

Conclusion: VCMamba成功融合了CNN和Mamba SSM的优势，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的特征表示能力，为视觉骨干网络设计提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at
https://github.com/Wertyuui345/VCMamba.

*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种多段落长度标注指南的语义分割方法，通过工人-监督者多代理协同和迭代精炼，实现了不需重新训练的指南遵循性分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中语义分割需要严格遵循复杂长文本标注指南的问题，传统方法需要费用昂贵的任务特定重训练，而现有开放词汇分割方法在复杂指南下表现异常。

Method: 提出了一种多代理、无需训练的框架，采用Worker-Supervisor迭代精炼架构：Worker负责分割，Supervisor根据检索到的指南对分割结果进行批评，轻量级强化学习停止策略决定循环终止时机。

Result: 在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上评估，该方法显著超越了最新的基线方法，展现了强大的沿用性和指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在不需重新训练的情况下，通过多代理协同和迭代精炼机制，有效解决复杂长文本标注指南的语义分割问题，同时保持资源使用的平衡。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

### [11] [Domain Adaptation for Different Sensor Configurations in 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04711)
*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两种技术解决不同传感器配置间的3D物体检测领域适应问题：下游微调和部分层微调，在相同地理区域的多传感器配置数据集上验证了有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同车辆平台使用不同的传感器配置导致点云分布差异，使得在一个配置上训练的模型应用到另一个配置时性能下降，而现有研究主要关注环境领域差距和单一LiDAR内的密度变化，不同传感器配置间的领域差距尚未充分探索

Method: 提出下游微调（多数据集训练后进行数据集特定微调）和部分层微调（仅更新部分层以提高跨配置泛化能力）两种技术，使用相同地理区域收集的多个传感器配置配对数据集进行验证

Result: 联合训练结合下游微调和部分层微调始终优于每个配置的简单联合训练

Conclusion: 为将3D物体检测模型适应到多样化车辆平台提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

### [12] [CD-Mamba: Cloud detection with long-range spatial dependency modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04729)
*Tianxiang Xue,Jiayi Zhao,Jingsheng Li,Changlu Chen,Kun Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CD-Mamba混合模型，结合卷积神经网络和Mamba状态空间模型，用于遮蓝远感图像的云盖检测。该模型同时处理短程空间冗余和长程大气相似性，在多种空间尺度上提高了检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远感图像常被云层遮蓝，影响数据完整性和可靠性。云检测需要同时处理短程空间冗余和长程大气相似性，而现有方法无法同时满足这两个需求。

Method: 提出CD-Mamba混合模型，将卷积神经网络（CNN）和Mamba状态空间模型集成到统一的云检测网络中。CNN抓取局部空间依赖关系，Mamba模型长程依赖关系，从而同时处理像素级细节和片段级依赖关系。

Result: 经过大量实验验证，CD-Mamba显示出了有效性，并在性能上超过了现有方法。

Conclusion: CD-Mamba通过结合CNN和Mamba的优势，能够全面抓取不同空间尺度上的依赖关系，显著提高了云盖检测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

*Dharsan Ravindran,Kevin Wang,Zhuoyuan Cao,Saleh Abdelrahman,Jeffery Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对SAM和SAM2在恶劣天气条件下分割性能下降的问题，提出了两种不确定性感知方法来提升自动驾驶场景的分割鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型在视觉模糊度高的恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，缺乏不确定性量化能力，这限制了它们在安全关键的自动驾驶应用中的可靠性。

Method: 1. 为SAM2设计多步微调程序，将不确定性指标直接融入损失函数；2. 将医学影像中的不确定性感知适配器(UAT)调整应用于驾驶场景。

Result: 在CamVid、BDD100K和GTA驾驶数据集上的实验表明，UAT-SAM在极端天气条件下优于标准SAM，而具有不确定性感知损失的SAM2在不同驾驶场景中均获得性能提升。

Conclusion: 显式的不确定性建模对于在挑战性环境中实现安全关键的自动驾驶具有重要价值，不确定性感知方法能显著提升分割模型在恶劣天气条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

Abstract: Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity

environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based
HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component

a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while
maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal
activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition,
realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

TL;DR: MCANet是一个多标签分类框架，通过多尺度特征学习和类别特定的注意力机制，显著提升了飓风后无人机图像损坏评估的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN方法难以捕捉多尺度空间特征，且难以区分视觉相似或共现的损坏类型，这限制了飓风后快速准确损坏评估的能力。

Method: 提出MCANet框架：使用Res2Net分层骨干网络丰富多尺度空间上下文；采用多头类别特定残差注意力模块，每个注意力分支关注不同空间粒度，平衡局部细节和全局上下文。

Result: 在RescueNet数据集（4,494张无人机图像）上达到91.75% mAP，优于多个基准模型。使用8个注意力头时性能进一步提升至92.35%，对Road Blocked等困难类别的AP提升超过6%。

Conclusion: MCANet能够有效定位损坏相关区域，支持可解释性，其输出可为灾后风险制图、应急路由和数字孪生灾害响应提供信息。未来可集成灾害特定知识图谱和多模态大语言模型来提升适应性。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于VLM的动态人群检测方法，通过全局优化图结构处理视频中变化的人群结构，在公开数据集上超越了现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测复杂人群需要考虑成员的局部外观特征和场景的全局上下文，同时人群结构在时间上应保持一致性。但以前的方法假设人群在视频中不变，无法处理动态变化的情况。

Method: 使用组织检测增强的CLIP特征提取局部和全局外观特征，通过全局优化图结构来处理所有帧的组织概率估计，实现动态变化人群的检测。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在组织检测任务上超过了现有的state-of-the-art方法。

Conclusion: 通过VLM特征提取和全局优化图结构的结合，该方法能够有效检测视频中动态变化的人群，为复杂场景下的人群检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

TL;DR: FloodVision是一个零样本洪水深度估计框架，结合GPT-4o视觉语言模型和领域知识图谱，通过识别参考物体、检索真实尺寸、估计淹没比例来准确计算洪水深度，在110张图像上达到8.17厘米的平均绝对误差。

Motivation: 现有计算机视觉方法在洪水检测中存在精度限制和泛化能力差的问题，依赖于固定的物体检测器和特定任务训练，无法适应多样化的洪水场景。

Method: 结合GPT-4o的语义推理能力和结构化领域知识图谱，动态识别RGB图像中的参考物体，从知识图谱检索验证高度，估计淹没比例，应用统计异常值过滤计算最终深度值。

Result: 在MyCoast New York的110张众包图像上评估，平均绝对误差为8.17厘米，比GPT-4o基线降低20.5%，优于先前的CNN方法，具有良好的泛化能力和近实时操作性能。

Conclusion: FloodVision为零样本洪水深度估计提供了准确且通用的解决方案，适合集成到数字孪生平台和公民报告应用中，增强智慧城市的洪水韧性。

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合塔框架PIG，通过生成伪查询实现细粒度交互，在文本-视频检索任务中同时实现了高效果和高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP-based方法中双塔框架效果差、单塔框架效率低的问题，希望同时获得高效果和高效率。

Method: 提出PIG方法，包含伪查询生成器为每个视频生成伪查询，使视频特征和文本特征能够进行细粒度交互，在推理阶段不增加额外开销。

Result: 在五个常用文本-视频检索基准测试中，R@1指标提升1.6%~3.9%，效率与双塔模型相当，性能接近最先进水平。

Conclusion: 混合塔框架成功结合了双塔和单塔方法的优势，在文本-视频检索任务中实现了效果和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 月球探测需要准确的图像注册来支持表面成图、资源定位和任务规划，但不同传感器（光学、超谱、雷达）的图像存在分辨率、照明和传感器异常等差异，给注册带来挑战。

Method: 评估五种特征匹配算法（SIFT、ASIFT、AKAZE、RIFT2、SuperGlue），使用赤道和极地区域的交叉模态图像对。提出预处理流程，包括地理参考、分辨率对齐、强度归一化以及适应性直方图均衡、主成分分析、阴影缩正等增强技术。

Result: SuperGlue始终产生最低的根均方差误差和最快的运行时间。SIFT和AKAZE等经典方法在赤道附近表现良好，但在极地光照条件下性能会降低。

Conclusion: 结果强调了预处理和基于学习的方法对于在多样化条件下实现健壮的月球图像注册的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的方法在移动设备获取的皮肤病变分类中具有巨大潜力，为资源有限环境下的AI辅助皮肤病筛查和早期诊断提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological
screening and early diagnosis in resource-limited environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高计算机视觉模型在安全关键应用(如交通场景感知)中的可靠性，需要准确且良好校准的预测不确定性估计。

Method: 使用混合专家模型(MoE)，通过门控网络动态加权专家预测，研究三种不确定性提取方法：预测熵、互信息和专家方差。

Result: MoE比集成方法在OOD数据下产生更可靠的不确定性估计，简单门控机制比复杂类别门控具有更好的路由不确定性校准，增加专家数量可进一步提升不确定性校准。

Conclusion: 混合专家模型是获取良好校准预测不确定性的有效方法，在语义分割任务中表现出色，特别是在处理分布外数据时。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在光场图像超分辨率中存在多方向扫描策略效率低下、特征提取冗余的问题，且状态空间在保持空间-角度和视差信息方面存在局限

Method: 提出子空间简单扫描策略(Sub-SS)和子空间简单Mamba块(SSMB)；采用双阶段建模：第一阶段使用空间-角度残差子空间Mamba块(SA-RSMB)进行浅层特征提取，第二阶段使用极平面Mamba块(EPMB)和极平面Transformer块(EPTB)的双分支并行结构进行深度特征精炼

Result: LFMT在真实和合成光场数据集上显著优于当前最先进方法，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的实质性提升

Conclusion: LFMT成功整合了Mamba和Transformer的优势，实现了跨空间、角度和极平面域的全面信息探索，为光场图像超分辨率提供了高效且高性能的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

Motivation: 现有端到端视觉定位方法仅依赖参考目标进行监督，忽略了潜在前景目标的益处，且缺乏多粒度判别能力，难以在复杂场景中实现鲁棒的目标识别。

Method: 提出PropVG框架，包含对比参考评分(CRS)模块（在句子和词汇级别进行对比学习）和多粒度目标判别(MTD)模块（融合对象和语义级别信息）。

Result: 在gRefCOCO、Ref-ZOM、R-RefCOCO和RefCOCO等多个基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PropVG成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过整合proposal生成和目标理解，结合对比学习和多粒度判别，显著提升了视觉定位性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and
models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/PropVG.

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

Conclusion: OmniFHT为流式细胞术平台提供了可扩展且无偏见的无标记形态计量分析解决方案。

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe-GS是一种用于移动自主空中机器人的语义3D高斯重建方法，通过粗粒度语义分割和颜色过滤快速隔离感兴趣对象，将训练时间减少约25%，同时保持高质量的新视角合成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动自主机器人应用（如远程指导和灾难响应）需要快速准确的3D重建，但传统方法重建整个场景效率低下。通过专注于特定感兴趣对象（PoIs）可以显著提高效率，特别是在机器人已经能够早期检测到这些对象的情况下。

Method: 提出CoRe-GS方法：首先生成具有语义信息的高斯粗粒度场景，然后使用新颖的基于颜色的有效过滤方法对语义对象进行细化，实现有效的对象隔离。这种方法在完整训练周期完成前就能实现语义3D高斯编辑。

Result: 在两个数据集（SCRREAM真实户外场景和NeRDS 360合成室内场景）上评估显示，训练时间比完整语义高斯训练周期减少约25%，同时获得了更高的新视角合成质量。

Conclusion: CoRe-GS成功平衡了高质量重建和减少训练时间的需求，通过语义感知的对象隔离方法显著提高了移动机器人3D重建的效率，特别适用于需要快速响应的关键应用场景。

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

TL;DR: Cryo-RL是一个基于强化学习的冷冻消融针放置规划框架，通过模拟临床环境和奖励函数学习最优放置策略，在583例前列腺癌病例中表现优于自动化基线方法，达到专家水平且规划时间大幅减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前冷冻消融治疗的前列腺癌冷冻针放置规划依赖人工经验，耗时且质量不一，需要自动化方法来提高规划效率和治疗质量的可重复性。

Method: 将冷冻消融规划建模为马尔可夫决策过程，在模拟环境中通过强化学习代理顺序选择冷冻针位置和冰球直径，基于肿瘤覆盖率的奖励函数学习最优策略。

Result: 在583例回顾性病例中，Cryo-RL相比最佳几何优化基线方法Dice系数提升超过8个百分点，达到人类专家水平，且规划时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够提供临床可行、可重复且高效的冷冻消融规划方案，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Motivation: 为开发适应性计算机化暴露疗法系统，研究预训模型能否准确预测人类对蜘蛛图片的恐惧程度

Method: 采用转移学习方法，适配三个不同的预训练计算机视觉模型，使其能够根据313张标准化蜘蛛图片预测人类恐惧评分（0-100分度），并使用交叉验证评估模型性能

Result: 模型达到平均绝对误差（MAE）在10.1到11.0之间，学习曲线分析显示减少数据集规模会显著抵影性能，可解释性评估证明模型预测基于蜘蛛相关特征，错误分析识别出远视图和人工/涂鸦蜘蛛等高错误情况

Conclusion: 证明了可解释计算机视觉模型在预测恐惧评分方面的潜力，强调了模型可解释性和足够数据集规模对开发有效情感感知治疗技术的重要性

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

Motivation: 工业设备壳损检测对预测性维护至关重要，但真实数据收集成本高、时间长，且缺乏多种壳损场景的数据集

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和3D模拟渲染引擎，生成不同锈状况的合成数据用于训练计算机视觉模型

Conclusion: 该方法为工业壳损检测提供了一种高效的合成数据生成方案，具有可定制性并可扩展到其他壳损检测场景

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

<details>

Motivation: 手动计数皮腺细胞中的液滴耐耗且主观，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性

Method: 使用Nile Red染色皮腺细胞图像，分为14个液滴计数类别，通过数据增广扩展到50,000个细胞。比较了基础MLP模型和注意力基础MIL模型的性能

Result: 基础MLP模型表现更稳定（平均MAE=5.6），而注意力MIL模型不太一致（平均MAE=10.7）但在某些折叠中更优

Conclusion: 简单的集合级聚合方法提供了健壮的基准，注意力MIL需要任务对齐池化和正则化才能充分发挥潜力

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

TL;DR: UniView是一个新颖的单图像新视角合成模型，通过检索相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，利用多模态大语言模型辅助选择参考图像，并采用多级隔离层适配器和解耦三重注意力机制来提升合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像新视角合成任务由于未观察区域存在多重解释而高度不适定，现有方法往往基于模糊先验和输入视图附近的插值生成不可见区域，导致严重失真。

Method: 1) 构建检索和增强系统，使用多模态大语言模型选择符合要求的参考图像；2) 引入具有多级隔离层的即插即用适配器模块动态生成目标视图的参考特征；3) 设计解耦三重注意力机制有效对齐和整合多分支特征以保留原始输入图像细节。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniView显著提升了新视角合成性能，在具有挑战性的数据集上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，结合多模态大语言模型和创新的特征对齐机制，UniView有效解决了单图像新视角合成中的失真问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法训练成本高，需要利用基础模型的跨模态知识迁移能力来提升效率

Method: 使用双视觉编码器提取丰富的语义和时间特征，用GPT-2替代线性映射器进行跨模态特征对齐，将特征映射任务视为自回归翻译任务

Result: 在语义和时间一致性方面表现更好，训练效率显著提升，仅需之前方法16%的训练量就能达到竞争性性能

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper通过多基础模型融合和GPT-2映射器设计，实现了高效且性能优异的视频到音频生成

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

Motivation: 现有红外-可见光图像融合方法假设高质量输入，无法处理双源退化场景，需要手动选择多个预增强步骤，导致误差累积和性能下降

Method: 设计引导频率模态特定提取(GFMSE)模块进行频域退化感知和抑制，以及引导空间模态聚合融合(GSMAF)模块进行跨模态退化过滤和自适应多源特征聚合

Result: 在双源退化场景下，GD^2Fusion相比现有算法和策略实现了更优越的融合性能

Conclusion: 该框架通过VLMs和双域联合优化，有效解决了双源退化场景下的图像融合问题，具有优越的性能表现

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,
and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest
accuracy (99.7%) and perfect sensitivity for malignant lesions. Classical ML
models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical
workflows and demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-performing,
interpretable systems for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection.

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

Abstract: The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with

ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

Result: ADClick在MVTec AD上达到AP=96.1%。ADClick-Seg在多类异常检测任务上取得AP=80.0%、PRO=97.5%、Pixel-AUROC=99.1%的优异性能，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ADClick和ADClick-Seg通过交互式标注和跨模态融合，有效解决了工业异常检测中标注困难的问题，显著提升了检测精度和效率，为工业质量检测提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

Motivation: 现有方法主要使用低阶几何先验（如法向量），且通过噪声敏感方法估计不可靠，需要更鲁棒的几何约束优化方法

Method: 提出GeoSplat框架，利用主曲率初始化高斯尺度，基于局部流形等几何结构引入高效且抗噪声的估计方法，提供动态几何先验

Result: 在多个数据集上的新颖视图合成实验中，GeoSplat显著提升了高斯溅射性能，超越了之前的基线方法

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将高阶几何先验整合到高斯溅射优化中，提供了更鲁棒和有效的几何约束方法

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的混合深度学习模型SIT，通过结合CNN的特征提取能力和Transformer的关系建模能力，显著提升了自动面部美学评分的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN模型在处理面部美学评分时存在一定局限性，它们通常以固定规模处理信息，容易忽略不同组织级别特征之间的关联性。需要一种能够显式建模多规模视觉线索之间交互作用的方法。

Method: 提出Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT)混合模型，首先使用并行卷积的多规模模块捕获不同感受野下的面部特征，然后将这些多规模表征构造为序列，通过Transformer编码器的自注意力机制显式建模它们之间的交互关系和上下文联系。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500标准数据集上达到了新的state-of-the-art结果，获得了0.9187的Pearson相关系数，显著超过了之前的方法。

Conclusion: 证明了显式建模多规模视觉线索之间的交互作用对高性能面部美学评分至关重要，SIT模型成功为复杂图像回归任务中混合CNN-Transformer模型的应用潜力提供了有力证据。

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

TL;DR: 使用稀疏混合专家(MoE)层替代CNN中的残差块或卷积层，在不增加推理成本的情况下提升模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，特别是在结合对抗训练时效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN对抗攻击鲁棒性提升方法往往需要大量资源，探索通过MoE层增加模型容量但不增加推理成本的方式来改善鲁棒性。

Method: 在ResNet架构的深层阶段插入单个MoE层，结合对抗训练，使用CIFAR-100数据集，评估PGD和AutoPGD攻击下的鲁棒性。

Result: MoE层结合对抗训练能持续提升鲁棒性；switch loss导致路由集中在少数专家上，意外使这些路径更鲁棒；某些单个专家的鲁棒性甚至超过门控MoE模型。

Conclusion: 稀疏MoE层是提升CNN对抗鲁棒性的有效方法，鲁棒子路径通过专家专业化自然涌现，为鲁棒性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

Motivation: 解决现实应用中源数据无法共享（隐私或成本原因）且目标数据标注稀少的问题，特别是在医学和生物学中普遍存在的回归任务场景

Method: 基于Contradistinguisher框架，开发了CRAFT方法，通过矛盾区分器进行正则化，实现源数据不可用情况下的半监督迁移学习

Result: 在两个神经科学数据集（EEG眼动预测和MRI脑龄预测）上，CRAFT比微调模型提升9%的RMSE，比四种最先进的源无关域适应方法提升3%以上

Conclusion: CRAFT是生物学和医学中普遍存在的回归任务的高效源无关半监督深度迁移方法

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

Conclusion: 该方法具有可扩展性、高质量和可控制的特点，适用于实际的3D内容创建应用

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

Conclusion: SGS-3D通过联合融合语义和几何信息，实现了高保真度的3D对象实例分割，为3D场景理解提供了高质量的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Abstract: The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, the commonly used
ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D

Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在生成符号图形程序方面的能力，特别是SVG生成，以此作为理解模型如何通过程序合成来理解视觉世界的视角。

Method: 引入SGP-GenBench基准测试评估模型性能；提出基于强化学习的方法，使用格式有效性验证和跨模态奖励（SigLIP用于文本-图像对齐，DINO用于图像-图像对齐）来改进SVG生成。

Result: 前沿专有模型显著优于开源模型，性能与通用编码能力相关；应用强化学习方法后，Qwen-2.5-7B模型在SVG生成质量和语义对齐方面大幅提升，达到与前沿系统相当的水平。

Conclusion: 符号图形编程提供了一个精确且可解释的跨模态基础视角，强化学习方法能够诱导更精细的对象分解和上下文细节，提高场景连贯性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments

recent methods, and still achieves superior cross-dataset generalization on
Sintel Final and KITTI, with a relative improvement of 10 and 15% over the
previous state-of-the-art SEA-RAFT, as well as on Spring and LayeredFlow
datasets.
