Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes是一种神经生成的基准标记，能够自然地融入真实环境，通过视觉上微小的修改将任意图像转换为可打印的隐蔽标记，用于6自由度位置追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准标记在美观性上存在问题，过于显眼的外观在某些场景下不受欢迎，需要开发能够隐蔽融入环境的追踪标记。

Method: 采用端到端训练流程，联合训练编码网络将图像转换为Ninja Codes，以及检测网络识别这些标记，使用深度隐写术的灵感。

Result: 实验表明Ninja Codes在常见室内光照条件下能提供可靠的位置追踪，同时成功隐藏在多样环境纹理中。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在传统基准标记因美观原因不适用的情况下具有特殊价值，可用于增强现实、机器人、运动界面等应用。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段的自动驾驶视觉问答系统，通过精心设计的提示和上下文增强，显著提升了预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发一个能够回答高级感知、预测和规划问题的自动驾驶视觉问答系统，通过改进提示工程和上下文信息来提升现有模型的性能。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：阶段1使用大型多模态LLM（Qwen2.5-VL-32B），输入六摄像头数据、历史时序窗口和思维链提示；阶段2增加场景元数据和任务特定指令。使用自一致性集成提高答案可靠性。

Result: 在驾驶QA基准测试中显著优于基线模型：阶段1（5历史帧+10-shot）达到65.1%准确率，自一致性提升至66.85%；阶段2达到67.37%。在严重视觉干扰下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示和上下文基础能够大幅提升预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D模型，用于解决纵向医学影像分析中不规则时间间隔序列数据的建模问题，在乳腺癌风险预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向医学影像分析面临数据挑战：如何有效建模高分辨率图像序列，这些序列包含关键的空间和时间信息，但现有方法无法充分利用。现有模型要么压缩空间信息，要么使用计算效率低且不兼容非均匀时间步长的时空模型。

Method: 采用状态空间架构，核心创新是连续时间选择性扫描机制，将真实检查时间差显式整合到状态转移中，并辅以多尺度3D邻域融合模块来稳健捕捉时空关系。

Result: 在乳腺癌风险预测基准测试中，验证c-index提高2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC得分均高于现有的循环、transformer和状态空间模型变体。

Conclusion: 该模型能够高效处理长而复杂的患者筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架，得益于其线性复杂度。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

### [5] [MoAlign: Motion-Centric Representation Alignment for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19022)
*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动中心对齐框架，通过从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，并将其与文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征对齐，以提升生成视频的时间一致性和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频扩散模型在生成高质量视频时，往往缺乏时间一致性和物理合理性，主要原因是模型对复杂运动的理解不足。现有方法通过对齐扩散模型与预训练视频编码器的特征，但这些编码器的特征混合了视频外观和动态，限制了对齐效果。

Method: 1. 从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，该子空间通过预测真实光流进行优化，确保捕获真实的运动动态。2. 将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征与这个新的运动子空间对齐，使生成模型能够内化运动知识。

Result: 该方法在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0等基准测试上进行了实证评估，并进行了用户研究。结果表明，该方法提升了最先进视频扩散模型的物理常识，同时保持了与文本提示的一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的运动中心对齐框架有效提升了文本到视频扩散模型生成视频的时间一致性和物理合理性，解决了现有方法中运动与外观特征纠缠的问题。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述评估的新指标，它使用场景图作为结构化评分标准来指导LLMs-as-a-Judge，在细粒度错误识别方面优于现有指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本的详细图像描述，特别是在属性、关系识别和错误定位方面存在不足。

Method: PoSh使用场景图作为结构化评分标准，通过LLMs作为评判者，产生基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。同时引入了DOCENT数据集进行验证，该数据集包含艺术作品和专家编写的参考描述。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上与人类评判的相关性比最佳替代方法提高了0.05 Spearman ρ，对图像类型具有鲁棒性，并且作为奖励函数优于标准监督微调。

Conclusion: PoSh和DOCENT为详细图像描述评估提供了更好的工具，揭示了基础模型在描述具有丰富场景动态的图像时面临的挑战，为VLM进展设立了新的基准任务。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UniHPR统一人体姿态表示学习管道，通过新颖的基于奇异值的对比学习损失对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态嵌入，在人体姿态估计任务中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对多种人体姿态表示之间相关性的系统研究，需要开发有效的对齐管道来生成统一的多模态表示。

Method: 使用基于奇异值的对比学习损失来同时对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态嵌入，构建统一的人体姿态表示学习管道。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上MPJPE达到49.9mm，在3DPW数据集上PA-MPJPE达到51.6mm，同时在Human3.6M上实现9.24mm MPJPE的姿态检索误差。

Conclusion: UniHPR能够有效对齐多模态人体姿态表示，在姿态估计和检索任务中表现出色，验证了统一表示学习的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出将注意力机制集成到3D U-Net模型中，以改进脑肿瘤分割性能，并采用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法来解决训练数据不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准U-Net模型在准确描绘脑肿瘤区域时面临挑战，特别是在处理不规则形状和模糊边界时。同时，在高分辨率MRI数据上训练鲁棒的分割模型需要大量计算资源，并且经常面临类别不平衡的问题。

Method: 将注意力机制集成到3D U-Net模型中，使模型能够捕捉复杂细节并在分割过程中优先考虑信息丰富的区域。此外，使用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法来解决训练数据不平衡问题并减轻偏差。

Result: 在BraTS 2020数据集上的评估结果显示，该模型优于相关研究，表现出dice系数0.975、特异性0.988和敏感性0.995的优异性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型在改善脑肿瘤分割方面表现出高效性，为临床环境中的可靠诊断提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究应用联邦近端(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据集，结合改进的U-Net注意力机制模型，在保护患者隐私的同时实现了96%的肿瘤分割准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球女性主要死因，需要早期检测和准确诊断。医疗数据的敏感性使得开发准确且保护隐私的AI模型具有挑战性，而联邦学习在非独立同分布数据集上的训练会影响模型准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 应用联邦近端(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据，结合改进的U-Net模型并加入注意力机制来增强肿瘤分割准确性。

Result: 该方法训练出的全局模型达到了96%的准确率，有效提升了肿瘤分割精度，同时保护了患者隐私。

Conclusion: FedProx方法在非独立同分布的本地医疗数据集上训练精确机器学习模型具有潜力，能够平衡隐私保护和模型性能。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

### [10] [X-Ego: Acquiring Team-Level Tactical Situational Awareness via Cross-Egocentric Contrastive Video Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19150)
*Yunzhe Wang,Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和跨自我对比学习(CECL)方法，用于研究复杂3D环境中的多智能体决策，通过同步的第一人称视角视频流促进团队战术理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解研究主要依赖第三人称视角，忽视了多智能体学习的同步自我中心特性，需要从个体视角建模团队战术。

Method: 构建X-Ego-CS数据集包含124小时专业级CS2比赛的第一人称视角视频流，提出CECL方法通过对比学习对齐队友的自我中心视觉流。

Result: 在队友-对手位置预测任务中，CECL有效提升了智能体从单一第一人称视角推断队友和对手位置的能力。

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电子竞技中的跨自我中心多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

motion dynamics directly from visual input. On multiple datasets, FootFormer
achieves statistically significantly better or equivalent estimates of foot
pressure distributions, foot contact maps, and center of mass (CoM), as
compared with existing methods that generate one or two of those measures.
Furthermore, FootFormer achieves SOTA performance in estimating
stability-predictive components (CoP, CoM, BoS) used in classic kinesiology
metrics. Code and data are available at

### [12] [Malaria Detection from Blood Cell Images Using XceptionNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19182)
*Warisa Nusrat,Mostafijur Rahman,Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文使用六种深度卷积网络对疟疾细胞图像进行分类，其中残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最佳，分别达到97.28%和97.55%的准确率，证明了深度学习在疟疾自动检测中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疟疾诊断依赖专家手动观察血涂片图像，存在专业知识不足和人为错误的问题，需要计算机辅助自动诊断系统来提高准确性和效率。

Method: 应用六种深度卷积网络（AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、残差注意力网络、DenseNet-121和自定义CNN）从血细胞图像中提取深层特征并进行分类。

Result: 在公开疟疾细胞图像数据集上，残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最好，准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的疟疾检测方法具有现实可行性，能够实现自动可靠的检测，同时最大限度地减少人工参与。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

Motivation: 现有方法要么引入额外数据进行训练，要么在推理时加入外部或内部信息，这些方法都会带来额外计算成本。研究发现MLLMs中的幻觉与对视觉token注意力不足密切相关。

Method: 提出PruneHal方法，利用自适应KV缓存修剪来增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注，无需额外训练，几乎不增加推理成本，且与不同解码策略兼容。

Conclusion: PruneHal是首个将token修剪应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，具有训练免费、成本低、模型无关等优势，能有效减少幻觉现象。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs

*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Video Consistency Distance (VCD)指标，通过基于奖励的微调框架增强视频扩散模型的时序一致性，特别针对图像到视频生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的奖励函数主要关注整个生成视频序列的质量，但在图像到视频生成任务中，时序一致性往往受到影响。

Method: 在视频帧特征的频率空间中定义VCD指标，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧信息，并将其集成到基于奖励的微调框架中。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验表明，使用VCD微调的视频生成模型显著提升了时序一致性，且不降低其他性能。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的指标，能够专门增强视频生成模型的时序一致性，特别适用于图像到视频生成任务。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive是一个用于自动驾驶感知任务增强的合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知引导图和3D资产渲染生成多视角逼真视频，显著提升自动驾驶中的边缘案例感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的驾驶世界模型主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽视了对于自动驾驶性能至关重要的下游感知任务的评估。现有方法需要先在合成数据上预训练再在真实数据上微调，导致训练周期翻倍，当基线方法也使用双倍周期时，合成数据的优势变得不明显。

Method: Dream4Drive首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，然后将3D资产渲染到这些引导图上，最后微调驾驶世界模型以生成编辑后的多视角逼真视频，这些视频可用于训练下游感知模型。

Result: 该框架能够以前所未有的灵活性大规模生成多视角边缘案例，显著提升自动驾驶中的边缘案例感知能力。同时贡献了大规模3D资产数据集DriveObj3D，涵盖典型驾驶场景类别。

Conclusion: 综合实验表明，Dream4Drive在各种训练周期下都能有效提升下游感知模型的性能，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了强大的合成数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

TL;DR: 提出了MoE-GS框架，将专家混合技术首次应用于动态高斯泼溅，通过体素感知像素路由器整合多个专家，提升渲染质量，并通过效率优化和蒸馏策略解决模型复杂度问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景下表现不一致，缺乏能有效处理所有动态挑战的统一方法。

Method: 使用专家混合框架，通过可微分权重泼溅将高斯级权重投影到像素空间，实现空间和时间一致性，并采用单次多专家渲染、门控感知高斯剪枝和蒸馏策略优化效率。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的实验表明，MoE-GS在提升渲染质量的同时保持了较好的效率，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoE-GS是首个将专家混合技术引入动态高斯泼溅的方法，通过统一的专家整合框架和效率优化策略，实现了在动态场景重建中的一致高性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

TL;DR: SFGFusion是一种基于表面拟合的相机-4D成像雷达检测网络，通过估计物体二次曲面参数来增强空间表示和跨模态交互，生成密集伪点云缓解雷达点稀疏性，实现多模态融合的3D目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D成像雷达具有低成本、远距离检测和精确速度测量等优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示和多模态融合效果。

Method: 通过图像和雷达数据估计物体二次曲面参数，使用表面拟合模型预测密集深度；深度信息用于图像特征从透视视图到鸟瞰视图的转换，并生成密集伪点云；采用基于柱体的方法处理点云分支，最终使用标准2D骨干网络和检测头进行目标检测。

Result: 在TJ4DRadSet和view-of-delft(VoD)目标检测基准测试中表现出优越性能，有效融合了相机和4D雷达特征。

Conclusion: SFGFusion通过表面拟合引导的多模态融合方法，成功解决了4D成像雷达点云稀疏性问题，实现了高性能的3D目标检测。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决GEO空间目标检测中的信号弱、背景复杂等问题，通过多帧时序分析和后处理优化显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

TL;DR: FadeLead是一个前景感知协作感知框架，通过课程学习策略将背景上下文信息压缩到前景特征中，在不传输背景的情况下提升感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法受限于带宽约束，只能传输前景区域特征而丢弃包含重要上下文的背景信息，这限制了感知性能。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，早期利用背景线索但逐步剪除，强制模型将上下文信息内化到前景表示中，无需传输背景本身。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试中，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均优于现有方法，证明了上下文丰富的前景共享的有效性。

Conclusion: FadeLead通过将背景上下文压缩到前景特征中，解决了协作感知中的带宽限制问题，显著提升了感知性能。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Motivation: 现有MAV动作识别方法大多依赖计算密集型模型，不适合资源受限的MAV平台，需要在识别精度和推理速度之间进行权衡。

Method: 采用MobileNetV4作为骨干网络，引入阶段式正交知识蒸馏(SOKD)策略从教师网络(ResNet18)向学生网络传递MAV运动特征，集成参数自由注意力机制，并开发混合损失训练策略。

Result: 在三个自收集数据集上平均识别准确率达92.12%，仅消耗136.16 pJ能量，处理速度为8.84动作/秒，动作解码速度比领先方法快2倍。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在语义对齐方面表现良好，但在生成正确数量的对象方面仍有困难。现有方法只能使用可微的回归模型作为批评器，无法利用计数能力更强的检测器模型，因为检测器的枚举计数本质是不可微的。

Method: 提出D2D框架，通过设计自定义激活函数将检测器logits转换为软二进制指示器，在推理时使用预训练的T2I模型优化噪声先验。

Result: 在SDXL-Turbo、SD-Turbo和Pixart-DMD模型上的广泛实验显示，在四个不同复杂度的基准测试中（低密度、高密度和多对象场景），对象计数准确性得到一致且显著的提升（如在D2D-Small基准上提升高达13.7%），同时图像质量和计算开销几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: D2D框架成功克服了检测器模型不可微的限制，有效提升了文本到图像生成模型的对象计数能力，为利用更强大的计数模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled

in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，通过同时预测水深和海底分类来解决浅水环境测绘问题，相比传统方法显著提升了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遥感图像处理方法将水深估计和海底分类视为独立任务，忽略了它们之间的相互促进作用，限制了深度学习方法的广泛应用。

Method: 采用双分支编码器分别处理水深估计和像素级海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和窗口化Swin-Transformer融合块整合跨任务特征，并使用动态任务不确定性权重平衡目标。

Result: 在两个异构沿海站点的广泛评估中，相比传统经验模型和机器学习回归方法，RMSE降低高达75%；相比最先进的单任务和多任务基线，水深RMSE降低10-30%，海底分类精度提升高达8%。

Conclusion: 联合建模水深与海底底质和栖息地能够产生协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供了鲁棒的开源解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，通过将fMRI信号与CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，无需额外的VAE通路即可实现高质量的图像解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将fMRI映射到CLIP的最终语义层，忽略了CLIP中间层丰富的物体信息，且与大脑功能层次结构不符。需要参数密集的VAE管道来捕捉视觉细节。

Method: 基于人类视觉系统功能层次结构，将不同视觉区域（低/高级）的fMRI信号对齐到相应的CLIP中间层和最终层，引入交叉重建策略和多粒度损失函数。

Result: 在高级语义指标上达到或超越SOTA方法，包括使用VAE管道的方法，同时参数减少71.7%，有效捕捉CLIP-only方法常忽略的视觉细节。

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP在语义准确性和细节保真度之间取得了良好平衡，无需单独的VAE管道，通过利用CLIP中间特征实现了高效的图像解码。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的开集词汇图像分割与识别框架，结合EfficientNetB0进行无监督分割和CLIP进行开集词汇物体识别，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统图像分割方法需要大量标注数据且无法识别未知类别的问题，开发一个无需训练、支持开集词汇识别的通用框架。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 使用EfficientNetB0提取像素特征，通过SVD分解和层次聚类进行无监督分割；2) 使用CLIP的ViT编码分割区域，与文本嵌入在共享潜空间中对齐，通过相似度计算进行识别。

Result: 在COCO、ADE20K和PASCAL VOC等标准基准测试中，在Hungarian mIoU、精确率、召回率和F1分数等指标上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了无需训练的开集词汇图像分割与识别的有效性、灵活性和泛化能力，为计算机视觉任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法在医学图像配准中往往忽视正则化的重要性，导致缺乏鲁棒性和解剖学合理性。

Method: 提出DARE框架，基于变形场梯度范数动态调整弹性正则化，集成应变和剪切能量项，并包含折叠预防机制惩罚负变形雅可比区域。

Result: 该方法减轻了非物理伪影如折叠，避免过度平滑，提高了配准精度和解剖学合理性。

Conclusion: DARE框架在医学图像配准中实现了更好的稳定性和物理真实性平衡。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

TL;DR: AegisRF通过注入对抗性扰动来保护NeRF模型的知识产权，同时使用可学习敏感性来约束几何扰动，保持渲染质量的同时破坏未经授权的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NeRF成为3D场景表示和视图合成的强大工具，保护其知识产权免受未经授权使用变得至关重要。现有方法避免几何扰动或限制在显式空间中，因为这会严重降低渲染质量。

Method: 提出AegisRF框架，包含扰动场和敏感性场。扰动场在NeRF预渲染输出中注入对抗性扰动来欺骗下游目标模型；敏感性场学习敏感性来自适应约束几何扰动，保持渲染质量。

Result: 实验评估表明AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态中具有通用适用性，包括多视图图像分类和基于体素的3D定位，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF有效保护NeRF模型的知识产权，在保持渲染质量的同时破坏未经授权的下游应用，为3D场景表示提供了有效的IP保护方案。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数VLM评估集中在单视角设置，忽略了多视角信息整合能力。随着多摄像头设置成为机器人平台标准配置，需要评估VLM是否能有效利用多视角输入进行机器人推理。

Method: 构建MV-RoboBench基准测试，包含8个子任务的1.7k个QA项目，评估包括开源和闭源模型在内的多种VLM，以及采用CoT启发技术的增强版本。

Result: 最先进的模型性能远低于人类表现，揭示了VLM在多视角机器人感知中面临的重大挑战。空间智能与机器人任务执行在多视角场景中呈正相关，现有单视角基准的强性能不能可靠转化为机器人空间任务的成功。

Conclusion: MV-RoboBench作为开放资源发布，旨在促进空间基础VLM和VLA的发展，提供标准化评估协议，推动多视角具身推理的进步。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种多条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)框架，能够生成具有精确控制属性的代表性孔隙尺度图像，解决了地下表征中的代表性和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取真正代表整体地层性质的孔隙尺度图像是地下表征的基本挑战，因为自然空间异质性导致提取的子图像与岩心测量值显著偏离，且数据稀缺问题加剧了这一挑战。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MRI加速范式，从图像重建转向预测性成像，通过生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，显著提升高加速因子下的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI采集时间长限制了临床效率，传统重建方法面临挑战，需要利用AI生成能力来加速MRI成像。

Method: 使用生成模型基于多种数据源（其他对比度图像、历史扫描图像、采集参数、患者信息）预测目标对比度图像，作为数据驱动先验来重建高度欠采样的数据。

Result: 在内部和多个公共数据集（总计14,921次扫描；1,051,904个切片）上评估，包括多通道k空间数据，在x4、x8和x12高加速因子下，预测先验重建方法显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该框架引入了从图像重建到预测性成像的根本性转变，为MRI加速提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PRGCN框架，通过跨序列模式复用解决单目3D人体姿态估计中的深度模糊问题，使用图记忆库存储姿态原型，结合Mamba和自注意力的双流架构实现时空建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频方法仅处理单个序列，未能利用跨序列的结构规律和重复运动模式，导致无法充分利用人体运动的先验知识。

Method: 使用图记忆库学习紧凑的姿态原型，通过注意力机制动态检索，结合解剖约束进行记忆驱动的图卷积；采用Mamba状态空间模型和自注意力的双流混合架构。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准测试中分别达到37.1mm和13.4mm的MPJPE，创下新纪录，并表现出更强的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨序列模式复用机制对推动领域发展至关重要，将范式从单序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

*Julia Wąsala,Joannes D. Maasakkers,Ilse Aben,Rochelle Schneider,Holger Hoos,Mitra Baratchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，特别是在甲烷羽流检测任务中。作者发现缺失像素覆盖率与标签之间存在虚假关联，导致模型在低覆盖率图像中检测性能下降。他们评估了多种插值方法，并提出加权重采样方案来消除这种关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像通常存在系统性缺失像素（如云层遮挡），这些非随机缺失数据会导致自动化特征提取模型产生表示偏差。在甲烷羽流检测中，缺失像素覆盖率与标签之间的虚假关联会使模型将覆盖率与标签关联起来，从而在低覆盖率图像中检测性能下降。

Method: 1. 评估多种插值方法以消除覆盖率与标签之间的依赖关系；2. 提出加权重采样方案，通过在每个覆盖率区间内强制类别平衡来消除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 研究结果表明，重采样和插值都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不会损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。在操作场景中，使用这些技术去偏后的模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的概率更高。

Conclusion: 通过插值和重采样方法可以有效解决卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提高甲烷羽流检测模型在低覆盖率图像中的性能，为实际应用提供了有效的去偏策略。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

TL;DR: 提出了Cauvis方法来解决单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关性问题，通过交叉注意力提示模块和双分支适配器分离因果-伪特征，在SDGOD数据集上实现了15.9-31.4%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流方法通过数据增强缓解域差异，但由于域偏移和有限域知识，模型容易陷入伪相关陷阱，过度依赖简单分类特征而非本质的域不变表示。

Method: 1. 交叉注意力提示模块：通过视觉提示与交叉注意力整合减轻伪特征偏差；2. 双分支适配器：通过高频特征提取分离因果-伪特征并实现域适应。

Result: 在SDGOD数据集上比现有域泛化方法性能提升15.9-31.4%，在复杂干扰环境中表现出显著鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效解决了单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关性问题，实现了state-of-the-art性能，证明了因果视觉提示在提升模型泛化能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

TL;DR: CARES是一个轻量级预处理模块，能够根据图像-查询对预测最小足够的输入分辨率，从而在保持任务性能的同时显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致视觉token占总token的97-99%，造成高计算成本和延迟，即使低分辨率图像已经足够。

Method: 使用紧凑型VLM（350M）提取特征并预测目标预训练VLM响应何时收敛到其正确回答能力的峰值，通过离散分类器训练但支持连续分辨率插值。

Result: 在五个多模态基准测试中，CARES在保持任务性能的同时将计算量减少高达80%。

Conclusion: CARES通过智能选择最小足够分辨率，有效解决了VLM中视觉token过多导致的高计算成本问题，实现了计算效率的大幅提升。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

TL;DR: 提出PoseCrafter方法，通过混合视频生成和特征匹配选择器，解决稀疏重叠图像对的相机位姿估计问题，显著提升小重叠或无重叠情况下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理小重叠或无重叠图像对时表现不佳，视频插值生成的中间帧模糊且选择策略效率低，需要更清晰中间帧和更有效的选择机制。

Method: 使用混合视频生成(HVG)结合视频插值和位姿条件新视角合成模型生成清晰中间帧，提出基于特征匹配的选择器(FMS)选择适合位姿估计的帧。

Result: 在Cambridge Landmarks、ScanNet、DL3DV-10K和NAVI数据集上的实验表明，相比现有SOTA方法，PoseCrafter显著提升了位姿估计性能。

Conclusion: PoseCrafter通过改进的中间帧生成和选择策略，有效解决了稀疏重叠图像对的相机位姿估计难题。

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在下游任务中表现优异，但在视觉推理方面仍存在诸多限制，如难以识别关系、理解时间序列和计数物体。本研究旨在深入探究这些失败的根本原因并针对性提升其推理能力。

Method: 在受控实验条件下研究了7个最先进视觉语言模型的计数能力，进行分层分析，并针对性地仅微调输出层。

Result: 实验表明视觉语言模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感。分层分析显示错误源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射不正确。仅微调输出层可将准确率提升高达21%，在真实数据集上也获得了一致的改进。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的计数错误主要源于输出层的映射问题，通过针对性的输出层微调可显著提升性能，这为改进视觉语言模型的推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本到图像（T2I）模型中提示复杂度对合成数据质量、多样性和一致性的系统性影响，通过合成实验和理论推导揭示了泛化难度，并提出了新的评估框架来分析真实数据与合成数据的效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然T2I模型能生成几乎无限的合成数据，但提示工程作为主要交互方式，其复杂度对数据效用关键指标（质量、多样性、一致性）的系统性影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 首先进行合成实验验证提示复杂度泛化难度，并通过理论推导解释观察到的困难；然后引入新的评估框架，在CC12M、ImageNet-1k和DCI等数据集上全面分析提示复杂度对常用T2I模型合成数据效用的影响。

Result: 合成实验表明向更一般条件泛化更困难；大规模实证实验显示增加提示复杂度会降低条件多样性和提示一致性，但减少合成-真实分布偏移；当前推理时干预方法能增加生成多样性但会超出真实数据支持范围，其中提示扩展方法在图像多样性和美学质量上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 提示复杂度对T2I模型合成数据效用有显著影响，需要平衡提示复杂度和数据质量；提示扩展方法通过使用预训练语言模型作为似然估计器，能有效提升合成数据的多样性和美学质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Conclusion: VLMs具有内在的时间感知能力，通过提取嵌入空间中的时间线表示可以有效支持时间推理任务，为多模态时间理解提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

TL;DR: 提出HAD框架解决RGB相机和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，通过层次化知识蒸馏实现多模态融合，提升目标跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势（RGB高空间分辨率，事件相机高时间分辨率和HDR），但两者存在显著的时空不对称性，阻碍了有效的多模态融合。

Method: 提出层次化不对称蒸馏(HAD)框架，通过层次化对齐策略建模和缓解时空不对称，在保持学生网络计算效率和参数紧凑性的同时最小化信息损失。

Result: 大量实验表明HAD始终优于最先进方法，消融研究验证了各设计组件的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: HAD成功解决了RGB和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，为多模态目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 随着目标检测模型在自动驾驶和监控等网络物理系统中部署，确保其对抗威胁的安全性至关重要。现有研究主要关注图像域攻击，视频域攻击特别是无盒设置下的攻击研究较少。

Method: 利用RGBA视频的alpha通道将恶意目标视频与良性视频融合，设计融合算法确保视觉隐蔽性和兼容性，无需访问模型架构、参数或输出。

Result: 在五种最先进的目标检测器、一个视觉语言模型和一个多模态大语言模型上评估，所有场景攻击成功率均为100%。

Conclusion: 揭示了视频感知系统中先前未被探索的漏洞，强调了在对抗设置中考虑alpha通道的防御措施的紧迫性。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Conclusion: VGD验证了其在环视重建中的可扩展性和高保真度。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DecAF方法，通过分解注意力融合机制将MLLM的注意力图直接转换为分割掩码，无需训练即可实现视频推理分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面表现优异，但其原始注意力图噪声多且与物体区域对齐差，需要一种无需训练的方法来精炼这些注意力图以实现定位。

Method: 使用分解注意力融合(DecAF)，包括对比性物体-背景融合和互补性视频-帧融合两种机制，结合注意力引导的SAM2提示来获得细粒度掩码。

Result: DecAF在无需训练的方法中表现优异，在参考和推理视频目标分割基准测试中达到与基于训练方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了无需重新训练MLLM即可实现高质量的视频推理分割，为训练免费的视频理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

TL;DR: 提出CBDiff模型，通过条件伯努利扩散模型生成多个伪造定位图，提高图像伪造定位的可信度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏高精度和可靠性，无法满足法医分析和安全监控等高要求应用的需求。

Method: 使用条件伯努利扩散模型，在扩散过程中引入伯努利噪声以反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性，并设计时间步交叉注意力机制利用语义特征引导。

Result: 在八个公开基准数据集上的实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多个多样化定位图有效处理伪造区域的不确定性和变异性，具有强大的实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性基准XBench，用于评估胸部X射线中跨模态可解释性，发现当前视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中虽然识别能力强，但在临床可靠的地面定位方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学领域中可靠的视觉-文本对齐对于模型可解释性和临床采用至关重要，但当前视觉语言模型的地面定位能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并在多个病理学上定量评估其与放射科医生标注区域的对齐程度，评估了七种CLIP风格的视觉语言模型变体。

Result: 发现：(1)所有模型变体对大型明确病理定位良好，但对小型或弥散性病变性能显著下降；(2)胸部X射线特定数据集预训练的模型比对通用领域数据训练的模型对齐更好；(3)模型整体识别能力与地面定位能力强相关。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型尽管识别能力强，但在临床可靠的地面定位方面仍有不足，强调在医学实践中部署前需要进行有针对性的可解释性基准测试。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于散射系数的去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来抑制高斯噪声，并证明该方法能达到卡通图像在所有Lipschitz指数α≤2下的极小极大渐近界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于帧的稀疏估计器（如小波、曲波等）无法充分适应复杂信号的规律性，特别是在卡通图像边缘为分段C^α曲线且α≤2时表现不佳。深度卷积神经网络虽然取得了更好的数值结果，但缺乏数学理论支撑。

Method: 引入散射系数作为简化的卷积神经网络模型，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来构建去噪估计器。散射系数通过对小波系数的模进行第二次小波变换计算得到。

Result: 数值实验表明，该去噪估计器在所有Lipschitz指数α≤2的情况下都能达到卡通图像的极小极大渐近界。证明了ℓ¹范数能够捕捉不同类型的几何图像规律性。

Conclusion: 该方法为信号去噪提供了不同的调和分析方法，能够指定函数的几何规律性，并在调和分析与深度卷积网络去噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

Method: 使用可变形消息提取器提取空间消息，通过条件扩散模型生成与自我智能体语义空间对齐的特征，并利用通道增强器进行特征优化。

Result: 在OPV2V-H、DAIR-V2X和V2X-Real数据集上表现优于现有方法，集成新智能体时计算成本和参数数量减少81%。

Conclusion: GenComm提供了一种轻量级且可扩展的解决方案，有效解决了异构多智能体协作中的域差距问题。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

Motivation: 解决现有时刻检索方法面临的三个关键瓶颈：(1)数据稀缺导致模型陷入浅层关键词特征关联；(2)相邻事件过渡区域的边界模糊；(3)细粒度语义区分能力不足。

Method: 提出零外部依赖的增强时刻检索框架AMR，采用两阶段训练：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义意识；蒸馏阶段引入双查询集（原始查询和主动查询），通过跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AMR相比先前最先进方法实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: AMR框架通过解决数据注释不足和边界语义区分能力缺乏导致的局部最优问题，显著提升了时刻检索性能，且无需额外数据标注成本。

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能，同时保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合全局定位和疾病细节，以及无需昂贵人工标注的强化学习，显著提升了医学诊断性能。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ReAct-GS方法解决3D高斯溅射中的过重建伪影问题，通过重要性感知的致密化准则和重新激活机制来消除局部模糊和针状扭曲。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在复杂场景中会出现过重建伪影，表现为局部模糊和针状扭曲。现有方法归因于大规模高斯分裂不足，但本文发现两个根本限制：致密化过程中的梯度幅度稀释和原始冻结现象。

Method: 引入ReAct-GS方法，基于重新激活原则：1）重要性感知致密化准则，整合多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域中停滞的原始增长；2）重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的原始元素。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重建伪影，在标准新视角合成指标上达到最先进性能，同时保留了精细几何细节。重新激活机制在其他3D-GS变体（如Pixel-GS）中也带来一致改进。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS成功解决了3D高斯溅射中的过重建问题，提出的重新激活机制具有广泛适用性，能够提升多种3D-GS变体的性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

*Zihao Chen,Yi Zhou,Xudong Jiang,Li Chen,Leopold Schmetterer,Bingyao Tan,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CST框架，在无配对图像翻译中专门保留细长曲线结构，通过集成结构一致性训练来提升医学图像翻译的几何完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无配对图像翻译方法在医学成像中会扭曲细长曲线结构（如微血管），影响诊断可靠性和定量分析，这在眼科和血管成像中尤为关键。

Method: CST框架通过添加曲线结构提取模块提供拓扑监督，可无缝集成到现有方法中，已在CycleGAN和UNSB两个代表性骨干网络上实现。

Result: 在光学相干断层扫描血管成像、彩色眼底和X射线冠状动脉造影三种成像模态上的综合评估表明，CST提高了翻译保真度并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CST通过强化学习映射中的几何完整性，为医学成像中曲线结构感知的跨域翻译建立了原则性途径。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ensemble-CAM的新技术，为基于深度学习的面部呈现攻击检测系统提供视觉解释，以提高系统的透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习呈现攻击检测系统多为黑盒模型，决策过程不透明，需要解释性技术来理解模型行为和决策依据。

Method: 提出Ensemble-CAM技术，通过视觉解释方法识别影响模型判断的关键区域，帮助理解为什么生物特征图像被判定为真实或伪造。

Result: 该方法能够为深度学习面部呈现攻击检测系统提供详细的视觉解释，增强系统决策的透明度。

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM技术能够有效提高基于深度学习的面部呈现攻击检测系统的可解释性、透明度和可信度。

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，通过时空注意力机制和稳定性约束从高维视频中提取可解释的动态系统变量，抑制视觉干扰因素，实现稳健的潜在表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取真实动态变量面临背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等视觉干扰因素的挑战，需要开发能够抑制这些干扰的鲁棒表示学习方法。

Method: 第一阶段使用基于TimeSformer的时空自编码器，通过全局注意力聚焦动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关分析选择物理意义维度，并使用Lyapunov稳定性正则化器优化转移动态。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验表明，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动保持不变性，在CNN和transformer基线中达到最低分析均方误差。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力与稳定性约束可以产生不仅准确而且物理可解释的预测模型，为动态系统分析提供了有效的框架。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ADQ自适应分布感知量化框架，通过自适应权重量化方案解决激活值分布不均和权重量化码本不匹配的问题，在ImageNet上ResNet-18仅用2.81位平均比特宽度达到71.512% Top-1准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化感知训练方法面临两个主要挑战：激活值的高度非均匀分布和权重量化中使用的静态、不匹配码本。

Method: ADQ框架包含三个关键创新：基于分位数的码本初始化方法、基于指数移动平均的在线码本自适应机制、以及灵敏度指导的混合精度分配策略。对于激活值，集成了硬件友好的非均匀到均匀映射方案。

Result: 在ImageNet上，ADQ使ResNet-18仅用2.81位平均比特宽度达到71.512% Top-1准确率，优于同类条件下的最先进方法。在CIFAR-10上的消融研究系统验证了各创新组件的贡献。

Conclusion: ADQ通过自适应分布感知量化有效解决了深度神经网络量化中的关键挑战，在保持高精度的同时显著降低了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X是一个多模态人体运动生成框架，使用自回归扩散变换器统一处理文本到运动、音乐到舞蹈、语音到手势等多种任务，并支持时空控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以统一处理多种运动生成任务，且缺乏对生成内容一致性和多模态冲突的有效处理。

Method: 提出参考运动作为条件信号，采用渐进式弱到强混合条件训练策略处理多模态冲突，构建了最大的统一多模态运动数据集OmniMoCap-X。

Result: 在多个多模态任务上显著超越现有方法，实现了最先进的性能，能够生成真实、连贯且可控的长时运动。

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X为多模态人体运动生成提供了一个统一且高效的解决方案，在一致性和可控性方面表现出色。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CPL-NC框架，通过类别感知原型缓存和负对比学习机制，解决视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的测试时适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练分布与部署分布不一致时性能会下降，现有测试时适应方法忽视了长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类别的混淆问题。

Method: 使用类别感知原型缓存模块动态调整每类容量，包含复活机制保留稀有类别知识；负对比学习机制识别并约束困难视觉-文本负样本；采用非对称优化，仅优化文本原型而固定视觉特征。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CPL-NC在ResNet-50和ViT-B/16骨干网络上均优于现有测试时适应方法。

Conclusion: CPL-NC是一个轻量级测试时适应框架，能有效提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为训练和评估下一代文本引导图像编辑模型提供了大规模、高质量、任务丰富的基础资源，推动了该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目深度估计进展迅速但缺乏标准化评估，现有评估指标的选择多样且其权衡和行为未被充分理解，需要定量分析指标对地面真值扰动的敏感性并与人类判断进行比较。

Method: 对现有指标进行定量分析，研究其对不同类型地面真值扰动的敏感性，并与人类判断进行比较；引入基于相对表面法线的新指标、新的深度可视化工具以及创建更好人类对齐的复合指标的原理方法。

Result: 分析显示现有指标对曲面扰动（如使平坦表面波浪化）严重不敏感；提出的新指标和复合指标方法能够更好地与人类判断对齐。

Conclusion: 单目深度估计的评估需要更敏感的指标，特别是对曲面扰动；基于相对表面法线的新指标和复合指标方法能够改善评估质量，促进更标准化的评估实践。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data
are available at: https://github.com/princeton-vl/evalmde.

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and
diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our
videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in
current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking
methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches
tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for
advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking
algorithms.
