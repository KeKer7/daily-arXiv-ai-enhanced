### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文比较了传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM仅需少量数据微调即可显著提升性能，匹配或超越需要大量数据的CNN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中的潜力，特别是在有限数据条件下如何有效利用其语言引导能力，解决传统CNN方法需要大量标注数据的问题。

Method: 对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行综合比较，重点研究LLM在少量数据（少于1000张图像）上的微调效果。

Result: 微调后的多模态LLM在人工文本叠加检测任务上实现了高达36%的准确率提升，性能匹配或超越了需要大量数据的CNN基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM方法在视觉任务中展现出卓越的适应性和数据效率，为低资源视觉环境中的跨模态学习提供了有效策略，证明了语言引导模型在精确视觉理解中的潜力。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但类别不平衡和模型泛化能力有限等问题阻碍了进展。

Method: 在公开MRI数据集上实验，使用U-Net架构配合焦点损失函数，评估了水平翻转、旋转和缩放三种数据增强技术的影响。

Result: 使用焦点损失的U-Net实现了90%的精确度，与最先进结果相当，并通过参数调优获得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: 通过公开所有代码和结果，本研究建立了一个透明、可重现的基线，为未来脑肿瘤分割中增强策略和损失函数设计的研究提供指导。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出通过调整初始噪声样本来减少文本到图像扩散模型中的记忆化问题，在保持图像-文本对齐的同时促进更早的吸引盆逃逸。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型经常记忆和复制训练数据，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)会导致非记忆化图像与输入提示对齐不佳，需要促进更早的逃逸。

Method: 提出两种缓解策略：集体或单独调整初始噪声，寻找能鼓励更早吸引盆逃逸的初始样本。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆化，同时保持了图像-文本对齐。

Conclusion: 初始噪声样本在决定逃逸时间中起关键作用，通过调整初始噪声可以有效缓解扩散模型的记忆化问题。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究测试了AI生成图像中的表征偏见，发现DALL-E 3和Ideogram在职业图像生成中都会强化传统性别刻板印象，尽管程度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注AI生成可视化内容的创建过程和质量，忽视了表征偏见问题。随着AI图像工具广泛使用，解决有害的性别偏见对于确保媒体和专业环境中的多样性表征至关重要。

Method: 通过提示生成超过750张职业相关的AI图像，使用DALL-E 3和Ideogram两个AI图像生成工具，并进行主题分析。

Result: 分析结果显示，两种AI工具都会强化传统性别刻板印象，但程度有所不同。AI可视化工具存在强化狭隘表征的风险。

Conclusion: 研究提出了针对从业者、个人和研究者的建议，以在生成具有可见性别的图像时增加多样性表征。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [5] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在视觉自回归模型(VAR)中引入动态专家混合路由机制，通过尺度感知阈值策略在不增加训练的情况下减少计算冗余，实现20% FLOPs减少和11%推理加速，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型在递增分辨率下重复调用Transformer导致计算冗余，需要提高计算效率。

Method: 集成动态专家混合路由器，采用尺度感知阈值策略平衡基于令牌复杂度和分辨率的选择。

Result: 减少20% FLOPs，加速11%推理速度，图像质量与密集基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 动态专家混合路由机制有效解决了VAR模型的计算冗余问题，实现了计算效率与图像质量的平衡。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性和随机不确定性，在LiDAR点云语义分割中显著提升了OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法依赖预测熵，但会混淆认知不确定性和随机不确定性，导致将分布内模糊区域误分类为OOD。需要一种能有效分离这两种不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用层次贝叶斯建模深度神经网络特征空间中的高斯混合模型参数，从中提取认知不确定性，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，相比之前的预测熵方法，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降低到40%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过层次贝叶斯建模有效分离认知不确定性，显著提升了无监督OOD检测性能，无需额外数据或训练。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Hi-OSCAR：一种用于活动识别的分层开放集分类器，能够在保持最先进准确率的同时拒绝未知活动，并提供超越二元分类的层次化定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类活动识别中存在训练数据中活动范围与实际生活中活动多样性之间的巨大差距，未处理未知活动会严重削弱分类器的可靠性。此外，活动类别之间存在不同程度的相似性和层次关系。

Method: 将活动类别组织成结构化层次，提出Hi-OSCAR分层开放集分类器，能够识别已知活动并拒绝未知活动，同时将未知类别定位到最近的内部节点。

Result: 开发了新的公开数据集NFI_FARED，包含多个受试者执行19种不同情境活动的数据，支持开放集HAR研究。

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR不仅实现了开放集分类，还提供了超越简单二元分类的层次化洞察，为开放集HAR研究提供了新的数据集和方法。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于无监督聚类的新方法，用于自动检测癫痫患者脑电信号中的高频振荡（HFOs），在控制数据集上达到97.67%的灵敏度和98.57%的精确度，并在癫痫患者数据中显示出与手术结果的强相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频振荡（HFOs）是识别癫痫灶的新生物标志物，但视觉识别HFOs耗时、费力且主观，因此开发自动检测方法对研究和临床应用至关重要。

Method: 使用S变换从时频域提取事件，然后采用无监督聚类技术对事件进行分类，将HFOs与尖峰、背景活动和伪迹区分开来。

Result: 在控制数据集上，该方法灵敏度97.67%、精确度98.57%、F分数97.78%；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点的HFOs率比值为0.73，与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: HFOs是癫痫患者癫痫发生性的有前景生物标志物，移除HFOs（特别是快速波纹）可导致癫痫无发作，而残留HFOs则导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

### [9] [Into the Rabbit Hull: From Task-Relevant Concepts in DINO to Minkowski Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08638)
*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了DINOv2视觉模型的内部表示机制，发现其概念组织超越了简单的线性稀疏性，提出了基于凸混合原型和概念空间的Minkowski表示假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DINOv2被广泛用于物体、场景和动作识别，但其内部感知机制的本质仍不清楚。研究旨在揭示该模型如何表示和组织视觉概念。

Method: 采用线性表示假说作为基线，使用稀疏自编码器(SAE)学习32,000个单元的字典，分析不同下游任务如何利用这些概念，并研究SAE学习概念的几何和统计特性。

Result: 发现分类任务利用'Elsewhere'概念实现学习否定；分割依赖边界检测器形成连贯子空间；深度估计使用三种单目深度线索。表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，概念组织更接近凸混合原型结构。

Conclusion: 提出Minkowski表示假说，认为token是通过凸混合原型形成的，这种结构基于Gardenfors的概念空间理论，为解释视觉transformer表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

### [10] [PhyDAE: Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts for All-in-One Remote Sensing Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08653)
*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhyDAE方法，通过两阶段级联架构将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，能够精确识别和处理多种异构退化（雾霾、噪声、模糊、低光照），在保持成像物理一致性的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化修复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，难以有效处理遥感图像采集过程中的多种复杂异构退化问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，包含残差流形投影器(RMP)和频率感知退化分解器(FADD)进行渐进式退化挖掘，引入物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，PhyDAE在所有四种修复任务中均取得最优性能，同时显著减少参数数量和计算复杂度，实现性能与效率的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: PhyDAE通过显式建模退化物理和智能专家激活机制，成功解决了遥感图像多退化修复的挑战，在保持高性能的同时大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实临床决策需要整合多种数据模态（医疗文本、2D/3D图像、视频），但现有视觉语言模型存在流程不透明、数据稀缺和架构不灵活等问题。

Method: 基于统一的基于补丁的视觉编码器和LLM解码器构建，逐步训练1670万个样本，从2D扩展到3D和视频理解，采用医学感知的令牌缩减实现高效训练。

Result: 在30个基准测试中表现优异，超越领先的开源模型，在视觉问答、医疗报告生成、多语言和罕见疾病场景的复杂推理任务中与专有系统竞争。

Conclusion: 通过开源完整流程，证明高性能医学VLM可以透明实现，为可访问和有影响力的临床AI提供基础工具。

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

*Kang Liao,Size Wu,Zhonghua Wu,Linyi Jin,Chao Wang,Yikai Wang,Fei Wang,Wei Li,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puffin是一个统一的相机中心多模态模型，通过将相机视为语言来扩展空间感知能力，能够从任意视角理解和生成场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决相机中心的理解和生成任务通常被孤立研究的问题，需要一个统一的模型来整合这两种能力，实现真正的空间智能。

Method: 提出将相机视为语言的新范式，使用语言回归和基于扩散的生成方法，在Puffin-4M大规模数据集上训练，结合全局相机参数和像素级相机映射。

Result: 实验表明Puffin在相机中心生成和理解任务上优于专用模型，并能泛化到空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导等跨视角任务。

Conclusion: Puffin通过统一的相机中心方法推进了多模态空间智能研究，将发布代码、模型、数据集和基准以促进该领域发展。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

### [13] [Structured Output Regularization: a framework for few-shot transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08728)
*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出结构化输出正则化(SOR)框架，通过冻结网络内部结构并使用组套索和L1惩罚，在少样本医学图像分类任务中取得竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习冻结部分权重并添加任务特定层的方法限制了模型适应领域特定特征的能力，且在数据有限时仍可能导致过拟合。

Method: SOR框架冻结内部网络结构（如卷积滤波器），同时使用组套索和L1惩罚的组合，以最少的额外参数为特定数据定制模型。

Result: 在三个少样本医学图像分类任务中，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4基础网络相比现有基准取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: SOR是一个简单有效的框架，可广泛应用于各种网络组件，为迁移学习任务提供了广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于生物视觉机制（中央-外周处理、眼跳运动、皮层填充）的对抗防御框架，通过强化学习引导的眼跳选择性采样多个视野区域，重建图像后分类，无需重新训练下游分类器即可提升系统鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统防御方法依赖计算密集型优化，而人类视觉系统通过进化机制天然具备对抗扰动的鲁棒性，受此启发研究注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码的作用。

Method: 结合三种生物机制：中央-外周处理、眼跳运动和皮层填充，使用强化学习引导的眼跳选择性捕获多个中央-外周视野区域，整合重建图像后进行分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法能提升多种分类器和攻击类型下的系统鲁棒性，同时显著降低训练开销。

Conclusion: 生物启发的预处理能有效缓解对抗噪声、保持语义完整性，且无需重新训练下游分类器，可与现有系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinearSR是一个基于线性注意力的图像超分辨率框架，首次系统性地解决了线性注意力在超分辨率中的训练不稳定、感知-失真权衡等关键挑战，实现了高效且高质量的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式超分辨率模型依赖自注意力的二次复杂度，计算开销大。线性注意力虽然提供线性复杂度解决方案，但在真实感超分辨率中面临训练不稳定、感知-失真权衡等未解决的关键挑战。

Method: 提出LinearSR框架：1）使用基于"拐点"的早期停止引导微调策略解决训练不稳定性；2）采用信噪比混合专家架构缓解感知-失真权衡；3）基于"精度优于数量"原则建立轻量级TAG引导范式。

Result: LinearSR同时实现了最先进的感知质量和卓越效率，其核心扩散前向传播达到SOTA级速度，整体多步推理时间保持高度竞争力。

Conclusion: 该工作首次为线性注意力在真实感超分辨率领域的应用提供了稳健方法，为高效生成式超分辨率的未来研究建立了基础范式。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且具有侵入性，需要开发非侵入式、高效的自动化识别方案。

Method: 结合YOLO和Grounding DINO进行目标检测，使用光流模糊检测、DINOv2图像编码和聚类方法，从喂食器视频中提取代表性关键帧。

Result: 所提出的关键帧选择方法在kākā重识别任务中实现了高准确率，为在更具挑战性的环境中收集的媒体数据研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 这种基于人工智能和计算机视觉的非侵入式方法为野生动物监测提供了有价值的替代方案，有助于生态学和保护生物学的新方法开发。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Q-Router，一种基于多层级模型路由的智能视频质量评估框架，通过视觉语言模型动态选择专家模型，解决现有VQA模型的泛化性、可解释性和可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估模型存在泛化能力差、可解释性有限、难以扩展到新内容类型等问题，特别是在处理用户生成内容、短视频和AI生成内容时表现不佳。

Method: 采用多层级路由系统，集成多种专家模型，利用视觉语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态推理并组合最合适的专家模型，最高层级包含时空伪影定位以增强可解释性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到或超越最先进的VQA模型，显著提升泛化能力和可解释性，在Q-Bench-Video基准上表现优异，并能有效定位时空伪影。

Conclusion: Q-Router通过智能路由机制结合专家模型的互补优势，为下一代VQA系统提供了灵活且鲁棒的基础，有望作为视频生成模型后训练阶段的奖励函数。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-VQA方法缺乏统一的模态对齐方案，困难负样本问题研究不足，常用知识融合技术可能引入无关信息

Method: 1) 多层级多模态多视图多阶段的异质模态对齐；2) 使用软标签的困难负样本挖掘方法；3) 集成答案词汇表作为先验知识的门控交叉注意力模块

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等广泛使用的Med-VQA数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一的模态对齐、改进的负样本挖掘和有效的知识融合，显著提升了Med-VQA任务的性能

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR是一种加速视频超分辨率的方法，通过识别低细节区域并跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理，显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的超分辨率方法在处理视频时计算成本高且速度慢，限制了向更高分辨率和更长视频的扩展。许多视频区域本质上是低细节的，从细化中获益甚微，但现有方法对所有像素进行统一处理。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，然后完全跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准超分辨率基准测试中，该方法在720p视频上比先前模型实现了高达60%的端到端延迟减少，且没有可感知的质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR是一种简单而有效的策略，在保持标准扩散和一步扩散超分辨率模型感知质量的同时，显著减少了计算量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

TL;DR: D-CoDe是一个无需训练的适配框架，通过动态压缩和问题分解来解决图像预训练视觉语言模型扩展到视频领域时的感知瓶颈和token过载问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将图像预训练的视觉语言模型扩展到视频领域面临挑战，因为需要处理密集且时间跨度长的视觉输入，这超出了图像模型的能力范围。

Method: 提出动态压缩（自适应选择代表性帧和内容感知的空间token聚合）和问题分解（将原始查询重构为子问题）两个组件。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe有效提升了各种基准测试中的视频理解能力，在具有挑战性的长视频基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: D-CoDe框架在复杂视频语言任务中具有潜力，能够有效解决视频大语言模型构建中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出FOLK方法，通过标签引导的知识蒸馏实现快速开放词汇3D实例分割，避免2D映射噪声并显著加速推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D实例映射到2D图像再使用视觉语言模型分类，会引入2D遮挡噪声且计算内存成本高，推理速度慢

Method: 设计教师模型提取高质量实例嵌入，通过标签引导蒸馏算法将开放词汇知识蒸馏到3D学生模型中，学生模型可直接从点云分类

Conclusion: FOLK方法通过知识蒸馏有效解决了开放词汇3D实例分割中的噪声和效率问题，实现了高性能和快速推理

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可应用于其他作物和场景，为作物生长监测提供了无需标注的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

*Daiki Yoshikawa,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP提出使用双曲空间的ℓ₁-Product度量来同时表达概念层次结构和跨概念组合性，解决了现有视觉语言模型难以同时处理这两种语义结构的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念家族内部的层次结构（如狗⊆哺乳动物⊆动物）和跨概念家族的组合性（如"车里的狗"⊆狗、车）。双曲空间能有效捕捉树状层次，但其对组合性的表达能力尚不明确。

Method: PHyCLIP在双曲空间的笛卡尔积上使用ℓ₁-Product度量。概念家族内部的层次结构在单个双曲因子中形成，跨概念组合通过ℓ₁-Product度量捕获，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有的单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供了更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间的ℓ₁-Product度量成功解决了同时表达层次结构和组合性的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

TL;DR: SegTrans是一种新颖的迁移攻击框架，通过将输入样本划分为多个局部区域并重新映射其语义信息来生成多样化的增强样本，从而提高对抗样本在不同分割模型间的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分割模型在白盒设置下对对抗样本具有显著脆弱性，但现有的对抗攻击方法在不同分割模型间的迁移性较差。复杂的上下文依赖性和特征分布差距导致迁移成功率不理想。

Method: 提出SegTrans框架，将输入样本划分为多个局部区域，重新映射语义信息生成增强样本，用这些增强样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留局部语义信息而非全局信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes两个基准数据集、四种不同分割模型和三种骨干网络上进行广泛实验，SegTrans显著提高了对抗迁移成功率，平均提升8.55%，计算效率提升超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans在不引入额外计算开销的情况下，显著提高了对抗样本在不同分割模型间的可迁移性，优于当前最先进方法。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

Motivation: 现有的知识蒸馏防御方法主要针对图像分类任务，难以直接应用于图像恢复任务，因为图像恢复是生成任务，具有连续高维输出，需要保持空间一致性和细节。

Method: ASVP方法在运行时对教师模型的内部特征图进行奇异值分解，放大前k个奇异值来注入结构化高频扰动，破坏蒸馏所需的对齐关系。

Result: 在五个图像恢复任务上的实验表明，ASVP可将学生模型的PSNR降低最多4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，且对教师模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源图像恢复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏提供了实用解决方案，相比现有方法提供更强更一致的防御效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务中表现出色，但其在面对被操纵视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 创建Ro-Bench基准测试，包含通过编辑风格、物体、背景及其组合生成的高质量、多样化且时间相关的反事实视频数据。

Result: 评估8个最新视频MLLMs发现，在反事实视频内容上性能显著下降；通过反事实数据微调，在Ro-Bench上性能提升21.73%，在MVBench的20个任务上提升12.78%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据能有效增强MLLMs的视频理解能力，强调了鲁棒性评估的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业无人机动物健康监测面临数据稀缺问题，且现有迁移学习方法因缺乏反映特定农场条件的大型数据集而效果有限，需要针对动物监测的特定数据增强策略。

Method: 开发了对象聚焦的数据增强框架，通过分割动物与背景，结合变换和基于扩散的合成技术，生成真实多样的场景以提升动物检测性能。

Result: 初步实验表明，使用增强数据集在动物检测任务上表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成领域特定数据，即使在数据稀缺情况下也能实现实时动物健康监测，弥合了有限数据与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)新范式，通过分解复杂感知问题为可处理的子问题，显著提升大视觉语言模型在视觉估计任务中的精度表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大视觉语言模型在视觉感知任务中精度有限，推理时缩放技术对感知提升效果甚微，这源于当前模型的快速感知范式将视觉理解视为一次性输出，缺乏对底层感知过程的建模。

Method: 提出感知时缩放(PTS)范式，鼓励丰富标记感知，将复杂感知问题分解为中间可处理的子问题，并结合强化学习技术。

Result: PTS显著提升感知精度，在DisTANCE基准上的高精度表现从8.0%提升至64.7%，在域外任务上泛化良好，即使使用纯合成数据也能在推理和真实世界感知基准上获得一致提升。

Conclusion: PTS通过引入更多感知相关标记并增强模型对图像标记的关注，使感知能够与推理时缩放对齐并从中受益，为提升大视觉语言模型的视觉感知能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过为预训练的毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测的可靠性，从而提高可解释性和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波姿态估计中，稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型从统计先验而非传感器数据推断身体关节，这种对先验的过度依赖会降低下游任务（如手势和活动识别）的性能。

Method: 引入mmJoints框架，增强预训练的黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器输出，添加关节描述符来显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测的可靠性。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置中使用超过115,000个信号帧进行评估，mmJoints估计描述符的错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提高达12.5%，活动识别性能提升达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式建模姿态估计中的偏差，有效提高了姿态估计的准确性和下游任务的性能，同时增强了系统的可解释性。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: HiMIR是一个高效的多模态图像检索调度框架，通过分层检索范式和冗余最小化技术，在提高检索准确性的同时显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法在检索准确性上存在局限，现有的多向量检索方法虽然通过分解查询和图像分割提高了准确性，但仍面临与图像对象对齐不佳和细粒度图像片段冗余的问题。

Method: 提出分层检索范式，使用多个中间粒度来处理不同的图像对象以增强对齐；利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性来最小化冗余检索；为不同数据集自动配置参数。

Result: HiMIR不仅实现了显著的准确性提升，而且比现有的多向量检索系统减少了高达3.5倍的计算量。

Conclusion: HiMIR框架通过分层设计和冗余最小化，在保持高检索准确性的同时大幅提升了效率，适用于多样化的应用场景。

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对生成图像中手部区域的质量评估任务HandEval，通过HandPair数据集训练，利用MLLM和手部关键点先验知识，显著提升了手部生成质量和AIGC检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在复杂局部区域（特别是人手）的细节生成上仍存在结构扭曲和不真实纹理问题，而手部区域质量评估被忽视，限制了人像生成优化和AIGC检测等下游任务性能。

Method: 构建HandPair数据集（48k高质量-低质量手部图像对），开发HandEval模型，结合多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力和手部关键点先验知识，建立人类标注测试集验证评估能力。

Result: HandEval与人类判断的一致性优于现有SOTA方法，集成到图像生成和AIGC检测流程中分别显著提升了生成手部真实性和检测准确率。

Conclusion: HandEval在生成手部质量评估方面表现出色，在下游应用中具有普遍有效性，为提升T2I模型的手部生成质量和AIGC检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

TL;DR: 提出首个防御性范例"不可着色示例"，通过在灰度图像中嵌入不可察觉的扰动来阻止未经授权的AI着色，保护漫画和电影等视觉内容的版权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI着色技术虽然能生成逼真的彩色图像，但存在版权侵权风险，如未经授权对黑白漫画和电影进行着色并转售。目前缺乏有效方法防止此类滥用。

Method: 提出PAChroma方法，通过拉普拉斯滤波器优化不可察觉的扰动以保持感知质量，在优化过程中应用多样化输入变换以增强跨模型迁移性和对常见后处理（如压缩）的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低着色质量，同时保持视觉外观。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI着色侵害的第一步，为生成媒体中的版权感知防御开辟了道路。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

TL;DR: 提出了Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2)框架，通过将去噪过程融入Jacobi迭代，实现自回归模型的并行token生成，显著加速图像生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型由于顺序token解码过程导致推理速度缓慢，需要数千次模型前向传递才能生成单张图像，存在效率低下的问题。

Method: 引入next-clean-token预测范式，通过低成本微调使预训练自回归模型能够接受噪声扰动的token嵌入并预测下一个干净token，利用去噪轨迹引导模型走向更稳定的Jacobi轨迹。推理时用高斯噪声初始化token序列，在嵌入空间进行迭代预测，使用概率准则并行验证和接受多个token。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够通过减少模型前向传递次数来加速生成，同时保持生成图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: SJD2框架成功解决了自回归文本到图像模型推理效率低的问题，实现了并行token生成，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了生成速度。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Method: 提出一种简单有效的方法：1）使用对抗扰动识别不确定视觉标记；2）在视觉编码器中间层的自注意力过程中掩码这些不确定标记

Result: 实验表明该方法显著减少了LVLMs中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有技术协同工作

Conclusion: 通过修改视觉编码器来抑制不确定视觉标记的影响，可以有效缓解物体幻觉问题

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

TL;DR: 提出了DGLSS-NL新任务——在噪声标签下的LiDAR语义分割领域泛化，并开发了DuNe双视图框架，通过强-弱分支的特征一致性约束和置信度感知过滤，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>

Motivation: LiDAR标注常因传感器缺陷、遮挡和人为错误而存在噪声，这种噪声会降低分割精度并在领域偏移下进一步放大，威胁系统可靠性。现有噪声标签学习方法在3D LiDAR分割中的领域泛化应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出DuNe双视图框架，包含强分支和弱分支，通过特征级一致性约束和应用基于置信度过滤预测的交叉熵损失来处理噪声标签。

Result: 在10%对称标签噪声下，在SemanticKITTI上达到56.86% mIoU，nuScenes上42.28%，SemanticPOSS上52.58%，算术平均49.57%，调和平均48.50%，展示了在DGLSS-NL任务中的鲁棒领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在噪声标签下的LiDAR语义分割领域泛化任务中表现出色，为处理3D点云数据中的标注噪声提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Motivation: 现有法向量估计方法在建模细粒度几何结构方面存在不足，而现有的Mamba方法主要关注全局形状结构，对局部几何细节建模不足。

Method: 提出注意力驱动的层次特征融合方案自适应融合多尺度点云补丁特征，并构建补丁级状态空间模型将点云补丁建模为隐式超曲面。

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit通过有效的局部几何建模显著提升了点云法向量估计的性能。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Motivation: 无人机在军事侦察、环境监测等领域的广泛应用对准确高效的多目标跟踪技术提出了迫切需求，但复杂背景、小尺度目标、频繁遮挡等问题持续挑战现有方法。

Method: 采用GL-DT框架，包含时空特征融合模块联合建模运动和外观特征，结合全局-局部协作检测策略增强小目标检测，并引入JPTrack跟踪算法减少ID切换和轨迹碎片化。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持实时性能的同时，显著提升了多目标跟踪的连续性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机检测与跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持，有效解决了复杂场景下的多目标跟踪挑战。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

*Youwei Zheng,Yuxi Ren,Xin Xia,Xuefeng Xiao,Xiaohua Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Dense2MoE方法，将密集的扩散变换器转换为专家混合结构，通过减少激活参数数量来提升推理效率，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在文本到图像生成中表现出色，但参数规模大导致推理开销高。现有压缩方法主要是剪枝，但激进剪枝会因模型容量减少而导致性能严重下降。

Method: 将DiT块中的前馈网络替换为MoE层，减少FFN中62.5%的激活参数；提出混合块选择性地激活DiT块；设计多步蒸馏流程，包括基于泰勒度量的专家初始化、负载均衡的知识蒸馏和MoB优化的组特征损失。

Result: 将大型扩散变换器转换为MoE结构，激活参数减少60%，同时保持原始性能，在广泛实验中超越基于剪枝的方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式，通过结构化稀疏化在减少激活参数的同时保持模型容量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOS是一个简单可扩展的数据合成流水线，通过对象中心组合策略将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中，使用结构化布局先验和生成重光照，产生准确多样的掩码、边界框和指代表达式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉分组应用广泛，但大型标注数据集成本高、存在偏见且难以扩展。合成数据有前景但缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性。

Method: 基于对象中心组合策略，使用结构化布局先验和生成重光照技术，将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中。

Result: 在10万张合成图像上训练的模型，在检测和定位任务上优于在更大真实图像数据集（如GRIT和V3Det）上训练的模型，在LVIS检测上提升+10.9 AP，在gRefCOCO定位上提升+8.4 N_Acc。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控数据集构建，在低数据和封闭词汇设置中改善泛化能力，为具有挑战性的类内视觉定位提供针对性数据生成。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

TL;DR: 提出MSDM多模态语义扩散模型，通过整合细胞形态、颜色特征和元数据来生成逼真的图像-掩码对，用于解决计算病理学中细胞和细胞核分割的标注数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中细胞和细胞核分割面临标注数据稀缺的挑战，特别是对于罕见或非典型形态。手动标注成本高昂，而合成数据提供了一种经济有效的替代方案。

Method: 使用多模态语义扩散模型(MSDM)，通过细胞/细胞核形态图(水平和垂直图)、RGB颜色特征和BERT编码的检测/指示元数据来条件化生成过程，通过多头交叉注意力整合这些异质模态。

Result: 定量分析显示合成图像与真实数据高度匹配，在匹配生物条件下生成图像和真实图像的嵌入之间具有低Wasserstein距离。合成样本显著提高了柱状细胞分割模型的准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强策略有效提升了细胞和细胞核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

*Satya P. Singh,Rashmi Chaudhry,Anand Srivastava,Jagath C. Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSepT是一种可分离的正交变换，通过离散余弦变换径向基和傅里叶谐波角基的张量积构造，克服了极坐标中的不可分离性障碍，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交矩图像表示方法存在高计算复杂度和数值不稳定性问题，特别是在大阶数时，Zernike和伪Zernike矩需要耦合的径向-角向处理，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出PSepT变换，采用DCT径向基和傅里叶谐波角基的张量积构造，实现完全核分解，支持独立的径向和角向处理。

Result: 将计算复杂度从O(n³N²)降低到O(N² log N)，内存需求从O(N⁴)降低到O(N²)，条件数缩放从O(N⁴)改善到O(√N)，在结构化数据集上表现出更好的数值稳定性和分类性能。

Conclusion: PSepT的可分离框架实现了传统方法无法实现的高阶矩分析，为稳健的图像分析应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出训练特征归因方法，将测试预测与特定训练图像区域关联，为深度模型提供细粒度解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常被视为不透明系统，需要可解释性方法来提高信任度和问责制。现有方法通常将测试时预测归因于输入特征或影响训练样本，作者认为应该将这两种视角结合起来研究。

Method: 探索训练特征归因方法，将测试预测与特定训练图像中的特定区域联系起来。

Result: 在视觉数据集上的实验表明，训练特征归因能够提供细粒度的、测试特定的解释：识别导致错误分类的有害示例，并揭示传统归因方法无法暴露的伪相关性（如基于补丁的捷径）。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因方法为深度模型内部工作机制提供了新的见解，能够识别传统方法无法发现的有害训练样本和伪相关性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位管道，无需患者CT扫描即可在手术中提供导航辅助，仅使用体模数据进行训练，具有良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统支气管镜导航方法依赖患者CT扫描和额外传感器，需要额外设置、扫描和培训。准确的度量定位并非总是必要，拓扑定位通常足以辅助外科医生导航。

Method: 开发基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位管道，仅使用体模数据进行训练，无需真实患者数据标注，避免了高昂的数据标注成本。

Result: 该方法在结果上超越了现有方法，特别是在真实数据测试序列上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需患者CT扫描的支气管镜导航辅助方案，仅需体模数据训练，具有良好的泛化能力，在真实数据上表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例级识别需要精细标注，但大规模标注数据集创建困难，限制了其实际应用。需要解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 从多个领域合成生成多样化对象实例，在不同条件和背景下形成大规模训练集，不依赖任何真实图像。

Result: 在七个跨领域ILR基准测试中，基于生成数据微调的基础视觉模型显著提升了检索性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据收集和整理提供了高效替代方案，仅需目标领域名称即可实现实例级识别，具有广泛实际应用前景。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO是一个新颖的开放世界目标检测框架，不仅识别未知对象，还能将其分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别，相比传统方法提供更细粒度的未知对象描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测器局限于封闭世界假设，无法处理现实场景中的未知对象。现有开放集检测方法将所有未知对象归为单一'Unknown'类别，这在安全关键场景中信息不足，需要更细粒度的分类来支持决策。

Method: TARO采用独特架构：基于sparsemax的head建模目标性、层次引导的重标记组件提供辅助监督、分类模块学习层次关系。通过语义层次结构将未知对象分类到粗粒度父类别。

Result: 实验显示TARO能将高达29.9%的未知对象分类到有意义的粗粒度类别，显著减少未知与已知类别的混淆，在未知召回率和已知mAP方面均取得竞争性性能。

Conclusion: TARO框架成功解决了开放世界目标检测中未知对象分类粒度不足的问题，为安全关键应用提供了更实用的未知对象描述能力。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

Result: oVDA在精度和VRAM使用上均优于所有竞争方法，在NVIDIA A100上达到42 FPS，在Jetson边缘设备上达到20 FPS。

Conclusion: oVDA成功实现了高效的在线视频深度估计，特别适合边缘设备部署，将发布代码和编译脚本。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial

study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based

EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized

achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

### [54] [3D Reconstruction from Transient Measurements with Time-Resolved Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09205)
*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，用于提升光子效率成像中的3D重建性能，包括LOS和NLOS成像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在光子效率成像中，由于传感器量子效率低和高噪声水平，特别是在长距离或复杂场景下，3D重建面临挑战。

Method: 设计了专门针对时空瞬态测量的注意力机制：时空自注意力编码器通过分割或下采样输入特征探索局部和全局相关性，时空交叉注意力解码器在token空间中整合局部和全局特征。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界数据上的广泛实验表明，TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS都显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TRT架构有效提升了光子效率成像的3D重建性能，并贡献了大规模合成数据集和真实世界测量数据，增强了该领域的数据多样性。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

### [55] [Stable Video Infinity: Infinite-Length Video Generation with Error Recycling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09212)
*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Stable Video Infinity (SVI)方法，能够生成无限长度视频，具有高时间一致性、合理的场景转换和可控的流式故事情节。通过错误回收微调技术，让模型从自身生成的错误中学习，解决了训练与推理之间的假设差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法存在误差累积问题，且仅限于单提示外推，产生同质化场景和重复动作。根本挑战在于训练假设（看到干净数据）与自回归推理现实（基于自生成、易出错输出）之间的关键差异。

Method: 提出错误回收微调技术：1）注入历史错误干预干净输入，模拟流匹配中的误差累积轨迹；2）通过一步双向积分高效近似预测，用残差计算误差；3）在离散时间步动态将错误存入回放记忆，为新输入重采样。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时兼容多种条件（音频、骨架、文本流）。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调成功解决了长视频生成中的误差累积问题，实现了无限长度视频生成，在一致性、创造性和条件设置方面都表现出色。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

TL;DR: 提出TEMA-LLM框架，通过LLM生成语义标签并融合多模态特征，使用标签增强的多注意力机制建模跨域用户偏好，在电商推荐任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域序列推荐需要同时捕捉域内和跨域的用户行为模式，以提供个性化体验。现有方法在语义理解和跨域建模方面存在局限。

Method: 使用LLM为物品生成语义标签，将标签嵌入与物品ID、文本和视觉特征融合，提出标签增强的多注意力机制来联合建模域内和跨域用户偏好。

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上的实验表明，TEMA-LLM持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的语义标签生成和多注意力集成对面向消费者的推荐系统具有显著优势，展示了LLM在推进智能用户中心服务方面的潜力。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and
video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual
impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based
methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion
models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are
further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable
reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart
transportation environments. Lastly, to stay current with rapid advancements in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗资源匮乏地区，肩部疾病的早期准确诊断面临挑战，急需低成本、易扩展的辅助诊断方案。

Method: 提出HMVDx框架，使用两个多模态大语言模型分别处理动作理解和疾病诊断任务，并引入基于医疗决策逻辑的可用性指标进行评估。

Result: HMVDx在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率相比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低成本多模态大语言模型在医疗应用中的潜力，为未来医学视频理解研究提供了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

TL;DR: 本文建立了图像隐私分类的零样本基准，比较了开源视觉语言模型与专用模型的性能，发现尽管VLMs资源消耗大，但在隐私预测准确性上仍落后于更小的专用模型，但在图像扰动鲁棒性方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献中越来越多地采用为通用任务设计的大型视觉语言模型进行图像隐私预测，但缺乏系统评估，可能忽略了专用模型设定的性能上限。

Method: 建立零样本基准进行公平比较，评估排名前三的开源VLMs，使用任务对齐的提示，并与已建立的视觉专用和多模态方法对比性能、效率和鲁棒性。

Result: VLMs虽然参数数量多、推理速度慢，但在隐私预测准确性上落后于更小的专用模型；但VLMs对图像扰动表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 尽管VLMs在通用任务上表现出色，但在图像隐私预测这一特定任务上，专用模型仍然具有优势，特别是在准确性方面。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

TL;DR: 该研究使用离散语义熵(DSE)来检测和过滤可能产生幻觉的问题，显著提高了黑盒视觉语言模型在放射学图像视觉问答中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定使用离散语义熵来拒绝可能产生幻觉的问题是否能提高黑盒视觉语言模型在放射学图像视觉问答中的准确性。

Method: 使用两个公开数据集评估DSE：VQA-Med 2019基准和诊断放射学数据集。GPT-4o和GPT-4.1每个问题回答15次，使用温度1.0。通过双向蕴含检查对意义等效响应进行分组，从生成的语义簇的相对频率计算DSE。

Result: 在706个图像-问题对中，基线准确率为GPT-4o 51.7%和GPT-4.1 54.8%。过滤掉高熵问题(DSE > 0.3)后，剩余问题的准确率分别提高到76.3%(GPT-4o)和63.8%(GPT-4.1)，统计学显著。

Conclusion: DSE通过量化语义不一致性，能够可靠地检测黑盒视觉语言模型中的幻觉，显著提高诊断答案准确性，为临床VLM应用提供过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法采样策略依赖手工启发式或外部关键帧模型，前者忽略重要时序线索，后者增加系统复杂度，需要更有效的统一解决方案。

Method: 训练时使用[FIND]令牌通过时序令牌相似度匹配识别关键时刻；推理时采用时刻中心采样策略密集采样重要时刻；开发双向锚点更新传播机制提升跟踪稳定性。

Result: 提出的框架自然整合关键时刻定位能力，避免外部时间戳编码需求，在保持运动细节和全局上下文的同时减少累积误差。

Conclusion: 该工作为RefVOS任务提供了一个高效统一的解决方案，通过联合优化时序语句定位和对象分割，实现了更好的时序推理和视觉理解。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Motivation: 现有多模态推理方法在RLVR优化过程中忽视了视觉感知的关键作用，需要从token感知的新视角来改进多模态强化学习。

Method: 提出VPPO算法，通过双重机制：基于整体视觉依赖性重新加权轨迹优势，并仅对感知关键token进行策略更新。

Result: 在8个感知和推理基准测试中，VPPO相比领先的开源RL调优模型取得了显著提升，在7B和32B模型规模上均验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 建立了分析多模态RLVR的token级感知新视角，提出了有效优化策略来显著增强LVLMs的多模态推理能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

Motivation: 传统模型强调基于图像的显著性，但眼动的基本时空统计特性仍未充分探索。理解这些动态特性在注意力建模和视觉界面中有广泛应用。

Method: 进行大规模人类被试实验，40名参与者观看50张多样化图像，使用高速眼动仪记录超过400万个注视点。分析数据并训练卷积神经网络从图像输入预测注视热图。

Result: 分析显示人类眼睛的注视轨迹遵循类似动物觅食的莱维行走模式。CNN模型能够准确再现新颖图像中的显著注视区域，表明注视行为的关键组件可以从视觉结构中学习。

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循类似于自然觅食的统计规律，为通过生成和预测框架建模注视行为开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有先进的多模态大语言模型在几何推理方面表现不佳，瓶颈在于对几何图形的理解而非推理能力本身。由于几何图形可以用简洁的文本描述，将视觉内容转换为描述提供了一条有前景的路径。

Method: 提出CapGeo框架，通过几何图形描述辅助推理，将视觉内容转化为文本描述；同时构建CapGeo-Bench数据集，包含4,641个精心筛选的图形-描述对，并采用基于关键点的评估指标。

Result: 实验显示配备描述后模型性能大幅提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升至59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升至73.0%。CapGeo-Bench的评估指标与下游性能高度相关。

Conclusion: 该框架和基准为推进多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力开辟了新途径，证明了通过几何描述连接视觉和文本模态的有效性。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Conclusion: 为未来6G网络的可扩展、节能和实时电磁数字孪生提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

TL;DR: 提出Hybrid-depth框架，通过整合CLIP和DINO基础模型来增强自监督单目深度估计的性能，解决语义-空间知识提取不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足而面临性能限制，需要更有效的上下文信息获取方法。

Method: 采用粗到细渐进学习框架：1) 聚合CLIP的全局语义和DINO的局部空间细节特征，设计对比语言引导的代理任务；2) 整合相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测，可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE管道集成。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中显著优于现有最优方法，所有指标均有提升，并有益于下游任务如BEV感知。

Conclusion: 通过语言引导聚合CLIP语义上下文和DINO空间细节，有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，提升了自监督单目深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出IRCR-Net网络，通过实例感知一致性正则化机制改进半监督细胞核实例分割，在标注数据稀缺的情况下实现准确分割


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像中细胞核实例分割对肿瘤微环境分析至关重要，但标注数据成本高且稀缺，现有半监督方法在实例级一致性正则化不足，缺乏病理结构先验知识利用，且训练中容易引入噪声伪标签

Method: 提出匹配驱动的实例感知一致性(MIAC)和先验驱动的实例感知一致性(PIAC)机制，结合细胞核形态先验知识评估伪标签质量，丢弃低质量伪标签，增强高质量预测

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在多个公共数据集上显著提升半监督细胞核实例分割性能，在某些场景下甚至超越全监督方法

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例感知一致性正则化和先验知识利用，有效解决了半监督细胞核分割中的伪标签噪声问题，实现了优异的性能

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于热红外图像增强的渐进式提示融合网络(PPFN)，通过建立基于热成像过程的提示对来调制模型特征，能够有效处理单一或复合退化问题，并在复杂退化场景中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外图像增强方法主要针对单一退化问题，难以处理耦合退化；而通用增强方法由于成像模型差异在红外图像上效果有限。

Method: 提出渐进式提示融合网络(PPFN)，基于热成像过程建立提示对，通过融合相应提示对来调制模型特征；引入选择性渐进训练(SPT)机制逐步优化模型对复合情况的处理。

Result: 该方法不仅能去除相机噪声、保留关键结构细节，还能增强热图像的整体对比度，在复杂退化场景中实现了8.76%的显著性能提升。

Conclusion: PPFN方法在热红外图像增强方面表现出色，特别是在处理复合退化问题时具有显著优势，为红外图像增强提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出利用视觉语言模型进行多模态关键词预测，通过零样本、监督微调、Fine-tune-CoT和动态CoT等策略提升模型性能，解决了传统多模态方法在缺失和未见场景下的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 传统多模态方法在处理缺失和未见场景时存在显著局限性，现有基准测试因训练测试重叠度高而高估模型能力，需要更有效的方法来提升多模态关键词预测性能。

Method: 1) 使用零样本和监督微调评估VLM性能下限；2) 采用Fine-tune-CoT利用教师模型生成的高质量推理数据微调小模型；3) 提出动态CoT策略，在训练中自适应注入CoT数据，使模型在推理阶段能灵活运用推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉语言模型和创新的CoT策略，成功提升了多模态关键词预测在复杂场景下的表现，为解决传统方法的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice是一个视觉中心推理基准，专注于从纯视觉内容进行推理，超越了浅层感知，需要细粒度观察和分析推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理，将视觉输入视为可替换的上下文。为了填补这一空白，需要建立一个基于挑战性感知任务的视觉中心推理基准。

Method: BLINK-Twice包含三个核心组件：七种视觉挑战类型测试视觉推理、自然对抗图像对强制依赖视觉内容、带注释的推理链用于细粒度评估推理过程。评估了20个领先的MLLMs。

Result: BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成显著挑战。现有的语言空间推理策略（如思维链或自我批评）可以提升性能，但往往导致不稳定和冗余的推理。重复图像观察能提高性能，主动视觉交互突显了视觉推理新范式的需求。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了当前MLLMs在视觉推理方面的局限性，并强调了开发视觉推理新范式的必要性，特别是需要主动视觉交互和细粒度观察能力。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅方法严重依赖初始点云质量，在城市等无边界动态环境中，由于观测视锥体重叠不足，往往导致点云覆盖不均匀和不完整，训练时会产生失真和伪影。

Method: 1）通过体素化可见性推理识别不可靠几何结构；2）使用多样性感知视图选择策略选取信息丰富的支持视图；3）基于块匹配的多视图立体重建恢复缺失结构；4）在缺乏初始点的区域生成新的高斯基元。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的大量实验表明，VAD-GS优于最先进的3DGS方法，显著提高了静态和动态物体重建几何的质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS能够通过可靠的几何先验生成新的高斯基元，有效解决3DGS在点云初始化不完整时的几何恢复问题，特别适用于具有挑战性的城市场景。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确量化森林生物量对碳循环监测至关重要。虽然机载LiDAR能捕捉3D森林结构，但直接从点云估计木质体积和地上生物量具有挑战性，因为难以建模区分树木所需的长程依赖关系。

Method: 将Mamba模型的选择性状态空间模型集成到Minkowski网络中，有效编码全局上下文和长程依赖关系以改进树木区分。加入跳跃连接来增强特征并加速收敛。

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模森林生物量分析提供了强大工具，推进了基于LiDAR的森林清单技术。

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Motivation: 基于transformer的模型在视觉任务中推理效率仍然是一个挑战，特别是在目标检测等任务中。论文旨在利用DETR中MLP层固有的稀疏性来提高推理效率。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1) SIBS：基于固定激活模式的启发式方法预测神经元不活跃性；2) MGS：在预训练DETR上训练的轻量级门控机制，使用小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的实验表明，MGS方法实现了85-95%的激活稀疏度，在保持甚至提高性能的同时显著减少了计算量。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，使得无需完整模型重新训练即可高效部署预训练的视觉transformer。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Motivation: 从单目视频重建的4D场景基于文本提示进行编辑是一个有价值但具有挑战性的任务，关键难点在于在复杂动态场景的局部区域实现语义精确编辑，同时保持未编辑内容的完整性。

Method: 方法包括：1）使用量化CLIP特征增强3D高斯形成语言嵌入动态表示；2）两阶段点级定位策略（CLIP相似度候选选择+空间范围细化）；3）基于扩散模型的视频编辑，使用流和涂鸦引导确保空间保真度和时间一致性。

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor提供了一个灵活准确的4D场景文本驱动编辑框架，通过语言嵌入表示和精确定位策略，成功解决了动态场景局部编辑的挑战。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过联合利用短期和长期时间线索，成功解决了低光视频增强中的噪声问题，实现了更好的增强效果。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

TL;DR: PhysToolBench是首个评估多模态大语言模型对物理工具理解能力的基准，包含1000多个图像-文本对，测试工具识别、工具理解和工具创造三个难度级别。对32个MLLM的评估显示它们在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代MLLM在具身AI和VLA模型中利用其广泛常识知识进行高级规划，但它们对物理工具的真正理解程度尚未量化，需要专门的基准来评估这一能力。

Method: 构建了包含1000多个图像-文本对的VQA数据集，评估三个难度级别：工具识别（识别工具主要功能）、工具理解（理解工具操作原理）、工具创造（在常规工具不可用时用周围物体创造新工具）。

Result: 对32个MLLM（包括专有、开源、专用具身模型和VLA骨干模型）的全面评估显示，在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出了PhysToolBench基准，揭示了MLLM在物理工具理解方面的不足，并提供了深入分析和初步解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

TL;DR: 三星智能手机图像中的对角线伪影会影响PRNU相机源验证，但PRO模式的原始图像可避免此问题。该伪影还可用于减少HDR误检和定位人像模式中的合成虚化区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究三星智能手机图像中的对角线伪影及其对PRNU相机源验证的影响，探索在无法获取原始图像时的解决方案。

Method: 分析多个三星Galaxy系列设备的图像伪影模式，比较普通图像和PRO模式原始图像的PRNU验证效果。

Result: 发现某些Galaxy S和A系列设备存在共同的伪影模式导致指纹冲突；PRO模式原始图像可进行可靠的PRNU验证；伪影可用于改善HDR图像检测和定位人像模式处理区域。

Conclusion: 对角线伪影既是PRNU验证的挑战，也可作为法证分析工具，在无法获取原始图像时提供替代解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

TL;DR: PRNet是一个实时检测框架，通过保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征来增强小目标表示，在计算约束下实现了优越的精度-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航空图像中小目标检测因像素表示有限而在特征提取过程中信息严重退化的问题，现有FPN方法通过后处理增强但重建细节常偏离原始图像信息。

Method: 提出PRNet框架，包含渐进细化颈部(PRN)通过骨干网络重用和迭代细化实现空间-语义对齐，以及增强切片采样(ESSamp)通过优化重排和卷积在降采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRNet在可比计算约束下优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和利用原始浅层空间特征，有效提升了小目标检测性能，实现了更好的精度-效率平衡。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多层感知机作为隐式神经表示进行形变时，需要昂贵的正则化，导致训练不稳定且特征对齐效果不佳。

Method: 将形变重构为微分向量流的构造，通过将结构流属性直接编码到网络架构中，确保变换的连续性和可逆性。

Result: 在面部形变、图像形变和高斯溅射形变等应用中，FLOWING实现了最先进的形变质量，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 基于流的方法能够产生原则性且稳定的变换，实现准确且结构保持的形变。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TC-LoRA提出了一种动态参数化控制方法，通过超网络实时生成LoRA适配器来调节扩散模型权重，相比静态激活修改方法显著提升了生成质量和空间条件遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控扩散模型使用静态架构修改中间激活来注入条件引导，这种固定策略无法适应多阶段去噪过程的动态需求，限制了模型从粗结构到精细细节的适应能力。

Method: TC-LoRA使用超网络基于时间和用户条件实时生成LoRA适配器，直接调节冻结主干网络的权重，实现动态、上下文感知的控制。

Result: 在不同数据领域的实验中，这种动态参数化控制相比静态激活方法显著提升了生成保真度和空间条件遵循能力。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA建立了一种新范式，通过更深层次的权重功能适应来修改模型的调节策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求保持一致。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

TL;DR: FSP-DETR是一个统一的生物医学检测框架，能够在单一模型中实现少样本检测、开放集识别和跨任务泛化，特别适用于标注数据稀缺和新兴类别的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学目标检测面临标注数据稀缺、新类别频繁出现的挑战，现有方法通常孤立处理这些任务，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 基于类别无关的DETR骨干网络，通过原始支持图像构建类别原型，使用增强视图和轻量级Transformer解码器学习嵌入空间，联合优化原型匹配损失、对齐分离损失和KL散度正则化。

Result: 在卵细胞、血细胞和疟疾检测任务上的广泛实验表明，FSP-DETR显著优于现有的少样本和基于原型的检测器，特别是在低样本和开放集场景下。

Conclusion: FSP-DETR提供了一个统一的检测框架，能够在推理时灵活支持未见类别识别、背景拒绝和跨任务适应，无需重新训练，为生物医学检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

Motivation: 视觉语言动作模型训练成本高昂，需要找到更高效的方法来为预训练视觉语言模型添加动作能力

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：首先进行轻量级对齐，将VLM隐藏状态映射到小型动作模型的动作空间；然后选择性微调语言模型、状态编码器和动作模块

Result: 在LIBERO上达到97.3%平均成功率（提升11.8%），在LIBERO-LONG上达到93.5%（提升24.5%），真实世界实验中比教师模型提升17%达到82.0%成功率

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏方法能有效让VLM生成精确动作，同时大幅降低训练成本

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理无限视频流时面临计算成本高、延迟大和内存使用过多的问题，需要一种能够实时稳定理解长视频的解决方案。

Method: 采用统一的训练-推理对齐框架，在推理时维护紧凑的KV缓存，重用注意力sink状态、近期视觉token和文本token。通过简单的监督微调策略，在短重叠视频块上应用完整注意力来模拟推理时的注意力模式。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，StreamingVLM对GPT-4O mini的胜率达到66.18%，在单个NVIDIA H100上保持高达8 FPS的稳定实时性能。同时，SFT策略还提升了通用VQA能力，在LongVideoBench和OVOBench Realtime上分别提升+4.30和+5.96。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM成功解决了长视频流式理解的计算挑战，通过训练-推理对齐框架实现了高效、稳定的实时性能，同时提升了模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.
