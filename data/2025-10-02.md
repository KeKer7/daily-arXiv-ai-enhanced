### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数，用于提升高光谱单图像超分辨率任务中空间细节和光谱保真度的重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱单图像超分辨率任务面临同时恢复精细空间细节和保持宽波长范围内光谱保真度的挑战，传统深度学习模型性能受限。

Method: 引入光谱-空间解混融合(SSUF)模块，结合光谱解混与光谱-空间特征提取，指导基于ResNet的CNN进行重建；提出空间-光谱梯度损失函数，整合MSE与空间和光谱梯度分量。

Result: 在三个公共遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，所提出的混合深度学习模型在降低模型复杂度的同时实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数能有效提升高光谱超分辨率的空间和光谱重建质量，同时保持较低的模型复杂度。

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，通过任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来，揭示了幻觉源于数据分布的可预测模式和继承偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言和视觉模型在现实应用中的广泛采用使得解决幻觉问题变得紧迫，因为幻觉会传播错误信息，造成财务和运营损害。现有研究对幻觉的理解仍不完整且碎片化，需要建立统一框架来理解根本原因。

Method: 提出了统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，采用任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来。

Result: 研究发现幻觉往往源于数据分布的可预测模式和继承偏见，通过深入理解这些机制为开发更鲁棒的解决方案奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该调查为在现实世界生成式AI系统中开发更鲁棒和有效的幻觉解决方案提供了基础，通过统一框架促进了对幻觉根本原因的理解。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RobustVLA方法，针对VLA模型的多模态扰动鲁棒性问题，通过输出鲁棒性优化和输入一致性增强，在17种扰动下显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要针对简单的视觉扰动，忽视了动作、指令、环境和观察等多模态扰动，需要开发全面的多模态鲁棒性方法。

Method: 采用离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况动作噪声，通过输入变化下保持动作一致性增强鲁棒性，使用多臂老虎机算法自动识别最有害噪声。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，RobustVLA相比基线在17种扰动下分别获得12.6%和10.4%的绝对性能提升，推理速度比现有视觉鲁棒VLA快50.6倍。

Conclusion: RobustVLA能有效提升VLA模型在多模态扰动下的鲁棒性，特别是在真实机器人场景中表现优异，为实际部署提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC框架通过无监督发现模型内在能力，基于梯度学习轨迹和影响力估计来筛选数据，仅需5%原始数据就能超越全数据训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令调优方法将模型视为黑盒，忽视其内在学习能力，导致数据预算减少时性能下降。

Method: 无监督发现内在能力，通过梯度学习轨迹分析能力，使用影响力估计将训练数据与能力关联，采用平衡选择和分阶段排序的课程学习策略。

Result: 仅使用5%原始数据，在多项多模态基准测试中超越了全数据训练的效果。

Conclusion: 内在能力是模型学习的基本构建模块，CADC为指令数据筛选提供了原则性范式。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了C³B基准测试，这是一个多文化、多任务、多语言的文化意识能力基准，包含2000多张图像和18000多个问答对，旨在评估多模态大语言模型的文化意识能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在任务设计上缺乏难度递进，缺少跨语言任务，且使用真实世界图像（每张图像通常只包含一种文化），使得测试相对容易。

Method: 构建了包含三个难度递进任务的基准：从基础视觉识别到更高级的文化冲突理解，再到文化内容生成。

Result: 对11个开源MLLMs进行评估，发现MLLMs与人类表现之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: C³B对当前MLLMs构成重大挑战，鼓励未来研究推进MLLMs的文化意识能力。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了6个先进开源文本到图像模型中的性别偏见，发现所有模型都系统性地将护士描绘为女性、外科医生描绘为男性，但不同模型对提示词的敏感度存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在专业、教育和创意场景中广泛应用，但其输出往往嵌入和放大社会偏见，特别是职业性别刻板印象，需要系统评估和解决。

Method: 使用精心设计的提示词，为5种医院相关职业和5种肖像修饰词组合生成100张图像，分析6个开源模型的性别表征模式。

Result: 所有模型都表现出系统性职业刻板印象：护士全为女性，外科医生主要为男性。不同模型偏差程度各异，Qwen-Image和SDXL男性主导最明显，FLUX.1-dev偏向女性，提示词修饰语也显著影响性别平衡。

Conclusion: TTI模型中的性别偏见既系统又模型特定，提示词措辞对人口统计结果起关键作用，需要偏见过滤设计、平衡默认值和用户指导来防止职业刻板印象强化。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer是一个基于强化学习的提示词反演框架，能够从少量示例图像中恢复其模板，揭示了提示词交易中的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型催生了提示词交易市场，但提示词本身可能被盗用，这带来了未受关注的安全风险。

Method: 将模板窃取视为顺序决策问题，使用基于相似度的反馈信号作为奖励函数，有效探索提示词空间。

Result: 在公开基准测试中达到最先进性能，将攻击成本降低至现有基线的13%以下，并能有效泛化到不同图像风格。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了提示词交易中固有的安全威胁，为新兴MLLMs市场中制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EDCT方法，通过自动生成反事实图像来测试视觉语言模型解释的忠实性，发现模型解释往往与预测的因果因素不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型生成的解释听起来合理但可能不反映真实的预测因素，这种可信度与忠实性不匹配带来技术和治理风险。

Method: EDCT方法：获取模型答案和解释→解析解释为可测试概念→通过生成修复生成针对性反事实编辑→使用LLM辅助分析计算反事实一致性分数。

Result: 在120个OK-VQA示例和多个VLM上测试，发现显著的忠实性差距，并生成监管对齐的审计工件。

Conclusion: EDCT能有效识别模型解释的忠实性问题，为模型可信度评估提供自动化验证工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDe是一个无需训练的多模态大语言模型框架，通过分层解耦方法解决高分辨率图像中的背景干扰问题，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，传统观点认为是物体尺寸问题，但本文发现主要原因是复杂背景干扰。

Method: 提出分层解耦框架HiDe：1）Token-wise Attention Decoupling解耦问题token识别关键信息；2）Layout-Preserving Decoupling解耦目标区域并重建紧凑表示。

Result: 在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上达到SOTA，Qwen2.5-VL 7B和InternVL3 8B分别达到92.1%和91.6%，内存使用比之前方法减少75%。

Conclusion: HiDe证明了背景干扰是高分辨率图像理解的主要瓶颈，通过分层解耦方法有效解决了这一问题，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FSDENet网络，通过结合空间域和频域信息来增强遥感图像分割的细节处理能力，特别是在边界区域和灰度变化区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决遥感图像分割中因灰度变化（如阴影和低对比度区域）导致的语义边缘模糊问题，需要充分利用空间信息。

Method: 使用空间处理方法提取多尺度空间特征和细粒度语义细节，通过FFT整合全局和频域信息，利用Haar小波变换分解特征为高低频组件以优化边界分割。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID四个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FSDENet通过空间粒度和频域边缘敏感性的双域协同，显著提高了边界区域和灰度过渡区的分割精度。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

### [11] [Less is More: Lean yet Powerful Vision-Language Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00060)
*Sheng Yang,Tong Zhan,Guancheng Chen,Yanfeng Lu,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Max-V1将自动驾驶重新概念化为广义语言，将轨迹规划任务构建为下一个路径点预测，通过单阶段端到端框架实现从前视摄像头输入直接预测轨迹，在nuScenes数据集上达到SOTA性能，提升超过30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自动驾驶重新概念化为语言建模问题，利用VLM的生成能力实现端到端的轨迹预测，避免传统模块化方法的复杂性。

Method: 提出单阶段端到端框架Max-V1，将轨迹规划视为序列生成任务，使用基于统计建模的原则性监督策略，通过模仿学习从大规模专家演示中学习复杂驾驶策略。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，相比之前基线提升超过30%，在跨域数据集上表现出优越的泛化性能和跨车辆鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更强大的自动驾驶代理奠定了基础，展示了将自动驾驶构建为语言建模问题的有效性。

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的CNN压缩设计空间探索方法和框架，通过基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略、一次性微调过程以及多种低秩分解技术的组合使用，实现了高效压缩且精度损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩分解技术面临秩选择困难、设计空间大、微调时间长、兼容性有限等问题，需要一种更高效和全面的解决方案。

Method: 使用基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略，采用一次性微调过程，集成三种卷积层和三种全连接层的低秩分解技术，在TensorFlow 2.x中实现端到端框架。

Result: 在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了显著压缩且精度损失最小，优于多个最先进技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的秩选择策略和多技术组合，为CNN压缩提供了一个高效、兼容且性能优异的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: The evolution of the 5S methodology with the support of artificial
intelligence techniques represents a significant opportunity to improve
industrial organization audits in the automotive chain, making them more
objective, efficient and aligned with Industry 4.0 standards. This work
developed an automated 5S audit system based on large-scale language models
(LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu,
Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The
system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa
= 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the
corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in
operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology
presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging
AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants
of different sizes.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无偏平滑神经元(USN)度量的神经网络剪枝方法，通过移除低USN神经元来减少过参数化，同时保持模型表达能力，并在对抗亮度对比度扰动的鲁棒关键点检测任务中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在视觉和机器人应用中广泛使用，但现有认证训练和鲁棒性认证方法面临过参数化问题，导致紧密度和可扩展性不足。需要解决语义变换扰动下的鲁棒性验证挑战。

Method: 首先分析层和神经元对输入扰动的稳定性和方差，提出USN指标来衡量可认证鲁棒性。然后基于USN进行剪枝，移除低USN神经元并保留高USN神经元。进一步提出Wasserstein距离损失来增强剪枝过程，确保剪枝后的神经元在层间更集中。

Conclusion: 基于USN的剪枝方法能有效减少过参数化，同时保持模型表达能力，在对抗语义变换扰动方面表现出优越的鲁棒性认证性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于传输建模和SCDT域分析的方法在高光谱异常检测中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型能大规模生成逼真图像，迫切需要检测合成图像并溯源的方法。现有水印技术对真实失真脆弱、易被自适应移除，且密钥更新成本高。

Method: 将编码问题建模为生成模型参数的密钥相关扰动，采用基于路由的MOLM方案，通过二进制密钥激活残差和注意力块中的轻量级LoRA适配器。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上的实验表明，MOLM在保持图像质量的同时，能抵抗失真、压缩、再生、平均攻击和对提取器的黑盒对抗攻击，实现鲁棒的密钥恢复。

Conclusion: MOLM框架避免了密钥特定的重新训练，实现了不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性等理想特性，为生成图像溯源提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放世界目标检测方法经常遭受已知和未知类别之间的语义混淆以及灾难性遗忘，导致未知类别召回率下降和已知类别准确率退化。

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD-Discover和CROWD-Learn两个组件：前者使用子模条件增益函数策略性地挖掘与已知对象明显不同的未知实例；后者采用新颖的组合目标联合解耦已知和未知表示，同时保持已知类别间的判别一致性。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，CROWD在M-OWODB和S-OWODB上分别实现了已知类别准确率提升2.83%和2.05%，未知类别召回率相比领先基线提高了近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD通过组合式方法有效缓解了开放世界目标检测中的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Method: 提出ExpDWT-VAE方法，采用双分支结构：一支处理空间域输入，另一支通过2D Haar小波分解提取频率域特征，然后合并形成空间-频率集成表示，最终映射为鲁棒的潜在表示。

Result: 在多个性能指标上的实验结果表明，该方法能有效增强潜在空间表示，使用TerraFly映射系统中的新卫星图像数据集进行了验证。

Conclusion: 该方法通过离散小波变换成功增强了VAE潜在空间表示，为卫星图像处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法假设理想化的观测历史，无法处理第一人称视角固有的感知伪影（如遮挡、ID切换、跟踪漂移），导致模型鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出BiFlow双流流匹配模型，同时去噪历史观测和预测未来运动；引入EgoAnchor机制，通过特征调制将蒸馏的历史特征条件化到预测解码器。

Result: BiFlow在minADE和minFDE指标上平均降低10-15%，实现了最先进的性能并展示了优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该基准和模型为开发真正适应真实世界第一人称感知挑战的轨迹预测系统提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory
retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于优化配对噪声图像自监督去噪的频谱控制网络(SCNet)，通过频率带选择、参数优化和频谱分离重建模块来解决传统方法在保留高频结构细节和避免学习高频噪声方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督去噪方法在映射配对噪声图像时存在两个实际问题：高频结构细节保留不足，以及在拟合高频时网络会学习到高频噪声。

Method: 1) 提出频率带选择策略加速训练收敛；2) 使用Lipschitz常数限制卷积核对高频噪声的学习能力；3) 引入频谱分离和低秩重建模块(SSR)通过频域分离和低秩空间重建来分离噪声和保留高频细节。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验验证了SCNet的有效性。

Conclusion: SCNet能够有效解决自监督去噪中的高频细节保留和噪声学习问题，提升去噪性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言目标检测器（如YOLO-World和Grounding DINO）在零样本识别方面表现优异，但在领域偏移下性能会下降，因此需要开发测试时自适应方法来提升其鲁棒性。

Result: 在多种分布偏移（风格化域、驾驶场景、低光条件和常见损坏）上的基准测试表明，该方法在YOLO-World和Grounding DINO上均优于零样本和TTA基线方法。

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA框架能有效提升视觉语言目标检测器在领域偏移下的性能，通过提案重叠分析和图像条件提示选择实现了稳定的改进。

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

TL;DR: MathSticks是一个用于视觉符号组合推理的基准测试，通过移动火柴棒来修正错误方程，结合视觉感知、符号操作和算术一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在组合推理方面存在局限，需要建立一个统一视觉感知、符号操作和算术一致性的测试基准来评估模型能力。

Method: 创建包含140万个生成实例的基准测试，包含文本引导和纯视觉两种设置，系统覆盖数字规模、移动复杂度、解决方案多样性和运算符变化等维度。

Result: 评估14个视觉语言模型发现显著局限：闭源模型仅能处理简单案例，开源模型在视觉模式下失败，而人类准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: MathSticks为推进跨视觉和符号的组合推理提供了一个严格的测试平台，揭示了当前模型的不足。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/Yuheng2000/MathSticks.

### [29] [Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00495)
*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的通用异常检测方法NAGL，利用正常和异常样本作为参考，通过残差挖掘和异常特征学习实现跨域异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用异常检测方法仅使用正常样本作为参考，忽略了现实场景中可用的异常样本所包含的宝贵信息。

Method: 提出了NAGL框架，包含残差挖掘(RM)和异常特征学习(AFL)两个关键组件。RM从正常-异常参考残差中提取异常模式，AFL通过残差映射自适应学习查询图像中的异常特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的通用异常检测方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在通用异常检测中采用正常和异常样本混合作为参考的工作，有效利用两种参考样本实现更准确高效的跨域异常检测。

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

*Kaiqi Zhang,Mingguan Yang,Dali Chang,Chun Chen,Yuxiang Zhang,Kexun He,Jing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAF是一种高效的图像特征提取技术，通过融合相对特征和绝对特征来改进稀疏线性系统的迭代方法选择，比传统图像选择方法快5.86%-11.50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像选择方法在特征提取时可能将不同矩阵编码为相同的图像表示，导致选择相同的次优方法，缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出RAF特征提取技术，同时提取并融合图像表示作为相对特征和对应数值作为绝对特征，创建全面的矩阵表示以防止特征歧义。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和BMCMat数据集上的综合评估显示，RAF将稀疏线性系统的求解时间减少了0.08s-0.29s，比传统图像选择方法快5.86%-11.50%，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: RAF通过防止特征歧义提高了选择准确性，释放了图像选择方法的潜力，在稀疏线性系统求解中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

### [31] [Affordance-Guided Diffusion Prior for 3D Hand Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00506)
*Naru Suzuki,Takehiko Ohkawa,Tatsuro Banno,Jihyun Lee,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型的生成先验方法，通过利用视觉语言模型推断的affordance感知文本描述来指导手部姿态精炼，解决严重遮挡下的3D手部姿态重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当手部大部分区域被自身或物体严重遮挡时，人类通常利用上下文知识（如affordance）来解决姿态模糊性。受此启发，研究如何利用affordance感知的文本描述来指导手部姿态精炼。

Method: 使用扩散生成模型学习在affordance描述条件下的合理手部姿态分布，affordance描述由大型视觉语言模型推断得到，从而将遮挡区域精炼为更准确且功能连贯的手部姿态。

Result: 在HOGraspNet数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法相比最近的回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的基于扩散的精炼方法，显著提升了手部姿态估计性能。

Conclusion: affordance引导的精炼方法能够有效改善严重遮挡情况下的3D手部姿态重建，生成更准确且功能连贯的姿态。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出EPIC框架，通过渐进一致性蒸馏解决多模态大模型中视觉token压缩带来的训练困难问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉token在多模态大模型中消耗大量计算资源，现有压缩方法忽视了压缩带来的特征空间扰动导致的训练困难

Method: 将token压缩引入的特征空间扰动分解为token维度和层维度，分别引入token一致性蒸馏和层一致性蒸馏，利用教师模型指导进行渐进学习

Result: 实验证明该框架具有优越的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: EPIC框架通过渐进一致性蒸馏有效解决了视觉token压缩中的训练困难问题

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

*Darya Taratynova,Ahmed Aly,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioBench是一个用于评估超声心动图基础模型的标准化基准，整合了8个公开数据集，涵盖4个回归和5个分类任务，为模型比较提供了统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图基础模型应用受限，缺乏标准化评估基准，现有解决方案多在私有数据上评估，限制了可比性。

Method: 将8个公开数据集统一为标准套件，评估心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器在零样本、探测和对齐协议下的表现。

Result: 不同模型家族各有优势：时域建模对功能回归关键，检索在分布偏移下稳健，领域特定文本编码器捕获生理意义轴，通用编码器迁移性强但细粒度识别困难。

Conclusion: CardioBench建立了可复现的参考点，为未来超声心动图基础模型设计提供实用指导。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

*Taeyun Woo,Jinah Park,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从粗到精的级联扩散框架，结合概率建模与级联优化，用于3D手部姿态重建，解决了姿态模糊性和不确定性建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性模型难以处理自遮挡和复杂手部关节带来的姿态模糊性，而现有概率方法仅限于单阶段估计且无法进行细化。

Method: 采用两阶段级联扩散框架：第一阶段使用联合扩散模型生成多样化的3D关节假设，第二阶段使用网格潜在扩散模型基于关节样本重建3D手部网格。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，并能有效建模姿态分布。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了概率建模与级联优化的优势，提高了3D手部姿态重建的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

TL;DR: 提出了Forestpest-YOLO框架，专门针对林业遥感图像中的微小、遮挡害虫检测问题，通过SPD-Conv、CSPOK和VarifocalLoss三项创新，在自建数据集上实现了最先进的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 林业环境中害虫检测面临目标微小、严重遮挡、与背景相似等挑战，传统检测模型因细粒度特征丢失和数据极度不平衡而表现不佳。

Method: 基于YOLOv8架构，集成了三项创新：SPD-Conv无损失下采样模块保持小目标细节；CSPOK跨阶段特征融合块增强多尺度特征表示并抑制背景噪声；VarifocalLoss优化训练目标，关注高质量和难分类样本。

Result: 在自建的ForestPest数据集上进行了广泛实验，Forestpest-YOLO实现了最先进的性能，在小目标、遮挡害虫检测方面显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: Forestpest-YOLO框架有效解决了林业遥感图像中害虫检测的挑战，为生态保护提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文展示了在微生物学图像分析中，使用少量标注数据即可达到传统方法性能的视觉基础模型，特别是MaskDINO在仅150张图像上微调就能接近YoloV9的检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微生物学图像分析需要大量人工标注数据，过程耗时耗力。本文旨在证明在应对新视觉任务时，无需进行大量标注即可获得良好性能。

Method: 构建包含5000张培养皿图像的数据集，模拟传统数据收集和少样本场景。比较三种视觉基础模型与传统基线模型在特定任务指标上的表现。

Result: MaskDINO在仅150张图像上微调就能达到与大量训练的YoloV9模型相近的性能，在25张图像时仍能保持竞争力，约70%的样本上表现可靠。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型能够以传统方法所需数据的一小部分达到相同效果，为自动化微生物系统开发提供了更快的迭代速度和更高的性能上限。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应共享专家(ASE)方法，在基于LoRA的混合专家框架中引入可学习的共享专家，通过路由器计算的权重与稀疏专家联合归一化，促进单任务到多任务学习的过渡，并采用细粒度专家设计提高知识共享效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE多任务学习方法依赖单任务预训练骨干网络，在从单任务到多任务学习转换过程中存在冗余适应和知识共享效率低的问题。

Method: 在基于LoRA的MoE框架中引入自适应共享专家，共享专家获得路由器计算的权重并与稀疏专家联合归一化；同时增加LoRA专家数量但按比例降低其秩，实现细粒度专家设计。

Result: 在PASCAL-Context基准测试中，ASE方法在各种配置下均能持续提升性能，验证了细粒度设计对多任务学习的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE方法通过自适应共享专家和细粒度专家设计，有效解决了MoE多任务学习中的知识共享和专家协作问题，显著提升了多任务学习性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

TL;DR: ArbInterp是一个创新的视频帧插值框架，支持任意时间戳和任意长度的帧插值，解决了现有方法只能生成固定数量中间帧的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成式视频帧插值方法只能合成固定数量的中间帧，缺乏调整生成帧率或总序列时长的灵活性。

Method: 提出了Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE)来支持任意时间戳插值，并通过分段帧合成和外观-运动解耦条件策略实现任意长度插值。

Result: 在2x到32x的多尺度帧插值基准测试中，ArbInterp在所有场景下都优于先前方法，具有更高的保真度和更无缝的时空连续性。

Conclusion: ArbInterp通过创新的时间戳感知位置编码和分段生成策略，实现了灵活高效的任意时间戳和任意长度视频帧插值。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

TL;DR: 提出MDS-NeRF方法，通过重新设计NeRF流程和动态风格注入模块，实现多层次的3D风格迁移，支持全视角风格转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF风格迁移方法通常将风格统计信息集成到原始NeRF流程中，导致内容保持和艺术风格化效果不佳。

Method: 提出多级特征适配器生成多级特征网格表示，动态风格注入模块学习提取相关风格特征并自适应集成到内容模式中，通过多级级联解码器生成最终风格化视图。

Result: 实验表明MDS-NeRF在3D风格迁移方面表现优异，能保持多尺度空间结构同时有效传递风格特征。

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF通过重新设计的流程和动态风格注入，实现了高质量的3D风格迁移，支持使用3D风格参考进行全视角风格转换。

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

Method: 集成大型视觉语言模型与语义模式匹配模块，采用优化领域特定提示和递归验证过程，通过迭代自问机制进行精炼。

Result: 在区分缺陷与非缺陷图像上达到98%准确率，在四类缺陷标注中达到85%-98%准确率（类别平衡），在类别不平衡数据集上达到80%-92%准确率。

Conclusion: ADPT为高保真数据集构建提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，为结构损伤评估中的迁移学习和领域适应等下游任务提供有力支持。

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言导航中前景和背景的重要性未被充分探索，前景提供语义线索，背景包含空间连接信息

Method: 使用语义增强地标识别分离前景和背景特征，采用共识驱动的在线增强策略，根据指令和位置整合两阶段投票结果

Result: 在REVERIE和R2R数据集上提升了基线模型的泛化能力并达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 前景-背景在线特征增强能有效提升视觉语言导航的泛化性能

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

### [43] [Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00618)
*Klara Janouskova,Cristian Gavrus,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOR方法通过将定位作为识别的组成部分，实现对象中心建模和上下文感知建模的解耦，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合，在不牺牲上下文信息的情况下同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习会导致模型过度依赖背景信息（捷径学习），限制了模型在现实部署中的鲁棒性。现有方法主要通过抑制背景来改善泛化，但牺牲了上下文信息。

Method: RCOR将定位作为识别的组成部分，解耦对象中心建模和上下文感知建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。

Result: RCOR提高了监督模型和VLM在具有域内和域外背景的数据集上的性能，即使在复杂场景（如ImageNet-1k）中也能实现定位后再识别。

Conclusion: RCOR是首个在不牺牲任一方面的情况下同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知的方法，证实了在复杂场景中定位后再识别的可行性。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

*Mengfei Xia,Nan Xue,Jiapeng Zhu,Yujun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用无条件判别器(UCD)来改进GAN训练，通过避免条件注入的冗余捷径，促进纳什均衡，在ImageNet-64上达到1.47 FID的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练对一步生成至关重要，但GAN训练在实践中难以正确收敛且容易陷入模式崩溃。研究发现条件判别器中的条件输入会产生冗余捷径，阻碍有意义的特征提取。

Method: 采用无条件判别器(UCD)，强制判别器在没有条件注入的情况下提取更全面和鲁棒的特征，从而为生成器提供更好的监督，促进GAN训练的纳什均衡。

Result: 在ImageNet-64数据集上实现了1.47 FID的优异性能，超越了StyleGAN-XL和多个最先进的一步扩散模型。

Conclusion: UCD方法能够显著提升GAN训练性能，理论保证表明其可与传统GAN理论兼容，并以插件方式实现。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合几何先验和网络学习过程，有效提升了深度伪造检测性能。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Conclusion: ReFlux为评估下一代文本到图像模型中概念擦除的鲁棒性提供了首个专门工具，揭示了现有防御方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

effectiveness in bridging closed-set consistency with open-vocabulary
flexibility for multi-modal tagging applications.

Method: 采用渐进式训练框架训练多尺度场景级云检测网络，结合多尺度概率图和云厚度图获得像素级云概率图，通过自适应阈值和距离加权优化生成二值云掩码。

Conclusion: SpecMCD方法在不同云覆盖条件下具有优越的云检测性能和应用潜力。

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Align Your Tangent (AYT)的新方法，通过引入流形特征距离(MFD)损失函数来改善一致性模型(CMs)的训练，显著加速训练过程并提高样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一致性模型虽然能实现一步或两步采样，但需要长时间训练和大批量大小才能获得有竞争力的样本质量。研究发现CM在收敛时的切线方向存在振荡问题，平行于数据流形而不是朝向流形。

Method: 提出流形特征距离(MFD)损失函数，提供流形对齐的切线方向，使更新方向指向数据流形。该方法被称为Align Your Tangent (AYT)。

Result: AYT方法能显著加速CM训练，甚至超越LPIPS指标的性能，并且能够在极小的批量大小下训练而不影响样本质量。

Conclusion: 通过解决CM训练中的切线振荡问题，AYT方法为一致性模型提供了更高效的训练方案，在保持样本质量的同时大幅减少训练时间和资源需求。

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有生成式AI方法往往忽略图像的几何结构，仅关注概率方法，且将潜在空间的概率分布视为无趣或预定义的。本文旨在统一几何和概率视角。

Method: 提出了几何框架和基于核的概率方法，将扩散模型解释为向图像流形的投影机制，构建了确定性模型MPPM，可在表示空间和潜在空间操作。

Conclusion: 通过统一几何和概率视角，提出的框架不仅解释了扩散模型的工作原理，还开发出了性能更优的确定性生成模型。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

*Jinchang Zhang,Zijun Li,Jiakai Lin,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件相机和知识蒸馏的开放词汇目标检测框架，通过事件-图像知识蒸馏利用CLIP的语义理解能力，结合SNN和CNN的混合架构来提取关键时间特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在目标检测中具有高速响应、低延迟和抗运动模糊的优势，但缺乏纹理和颜色信息，使得开放词汇检测面临挑战。现有事件检测方法通常只能在预定义类别上训练，难以泛化到新物体。

Method: 使用图像帧作为教师模型输入，通过空间注意力蒸馏指导基于事件的学生模型学习CLIP的丰富视觉表示；设计SNN-CNN混合框架，SNN自适应确定最佳事件分割时刻，CNN处理提取的事件特征进行目标检测。

Result: 该方法能够直接从原始事件输入中学习有意义的视觉特征，同时继承CLIP的广泛视觉知识，避免了固定分组事件分割方法造成的关键时间信息丢失问题。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功弥合了事件流与图像之间的模态差距，实现了事件数据上的开放词汇目标检测，为事件相机在复杂场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出ProtoMask模型，使用图像分割基础模型来改进原型案例推理方法的可解释性，通过将显著性图计算限制在预定义的语义图像块中来提高可视化可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于原型案例推理的XAI方法通常依赖额外的后处理显著性技术来解释学习到的原型语义，但这些技术的可靠性和质量受到质疑。

Method: 使用图像分割基础模型生成分割掩码，用每个掩码的边界框裁剪图像，构建ProtoMask模型架构，将显著性图计算限制在语义图像块内。

Result: 在三个细粒度分类数据集上的实验表明，ProtoMask模型具有竞争性的性能和独特的可解释性特征。

Conclusion: ProtoMask通过结合图像分割模型改进了原型方法的可解释性，提供了更可靠的语义映射和可视化效果。

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

TL;DR: MoE-SGT是一个基于推理的概念瓶颈模型框架，通过图变换器和混合专家模块增强概念关系建模，在多数据集上实现更高准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)存在单模态和忽略结构化概念关系的局限性，无法满足高风险领域对深度学习可解释性的需求

Method: 构建答案-概念和答案-问题图来显式建模概念关系，集成图变换器捕获多层次依赖，并用混合专家模块替代前馈层以动态分配推理任务

Result: MoE-SGT在多个数据集上比其他概念瓶颈网络获得更高准确率，通过建模结构化概念关系和动态专家选择机制提升性能

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式建模结构化概念关系和动态专家分配，有效提升了概念瓶颈模型在复杂概念推理中的适应性和性能

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于MLLM内在不确定性的训练免费框架，通过响应熵值来指导模型关注最相关的视觉信息，在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时间定位任务中达到与专业微调方法竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知任务中表现不佳，现有方法依赖复杂的任务特定微调，限制了泛化能力并增加了模型复杂度。

Method: 利用MLLM内在不确定性作为主动指导信号，通过响应熵值对候选视觉输入进行评分，使模型能够自主聚焦于最显著的数据。

Result: 在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时间定位三个复杂视觉任务中，现成的MLLM能够达到与专业微调方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 利用内在不确定性是增强细粒度多模态性能的强大通用策略。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于无监督深度学习的运动校正方法，用于心脏磁共振灌注成像，替代传统的迭代配准方法，显著提高了处理速度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于配准的运动校正方法速度慢且对采集变异性敏感，限制了定量灌注成像的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用无监督深度学习管道，通过三步运动校正和鲁棒主成分分析减少对比度相关效应，对齐灌注序列和辅助图像。在201名患者的多厂商数据上训练和验证。

Result: 深度学习方法显著改善了时间-强度曲线的时间平滑性，心肌对齐效果与基线相当但优于未配准状态，灌注图运动减少，处理时间缩短15倍。

Conclusion: 该深度学习管道实现了快速、鲁棒的运动校正，提高了动态和辅助图像的准确性，在多厂商数据上训练使其能够跨序列泛化，有助于定量灌注成像的临床推广。

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探索使用低成本EEG设备的12个通道子集进行情绪预测，通过连续小波变换和视觉变换器模型，在DEAP数据集上实现了91.57%的准确率，接近32通道96.9%的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情绪预测方法（如自我评估和面部表情分析）存在主观性和模糊性问题，而完整EEG测量复杂且资源密集。低成本EEG设备提供了更直接、无偏的数据源，但需要验证其简化测量能力是否能实现足够准确的情绪预测。

Method: 使用DEAP数据集的EEG通道子集，通过连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，然后训练视觉变换器（ViT）模型进行情绪分类，特别关注仅使用12个测量点的性能。

Result: 模型在预测4个象限（高/低唤醒度和效价）时达到了91.57%的准确率，仅使用12个测量通道，与使用32个通道的最先进结果96.9%相比，性能下降很小。

Conclusion: 显著减少输入通道数量仍能获得高准确率，证明低成本EEG设备在情绪预测任务中具有实际应用价值，为资源受限环境下的情感计算提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有盲图像恢复方法在处理极端退化情况时表现不佳，由于ELQ到HQ的巨大域差距导致不自然伪影和细节丢失。

Method: 首先学习一个投影器将ELQ图像映射到中间LQ流形，然后使用冻结的现成BIR模型恢复为HQ。基于信息瓶颈理论推导训练目标，平衡低质量重建和高质量先验匹配。

Result: 在严重退化情况下进行了广泛实验，验证了方法的有效性，支持推理时提示精炼和即插即用增强现有模型。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了极端盲图像恢复问题，通过分解恢复过程和理论驱动的训练目标实现了稳定训练和高质量恢复。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在陶瓷制造中，无损检测对确保组件质量至关重要。光学相干断层扫描(OCT)能够提供高分辨率内部成像，但需要自动化方法来检测孔隙、分层或夹杂等缺陷。

Method: 基于U-Net架构的神经网络，使用手动分割标注的OCT图像进行训练，评估多种实验配置以提升性能，并采用后处理技术进行定量和定性评估。

Result: 系统表现出色，Dice Score达到0.979，优于同类研究，推理时间为18.98秒/体积，能够有效检测夹杂物缺陷。

Conclusion: 该系统实现了高效、可靠和自动化的质量检测，支持陶瓷制造中的无损检测应用。

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per
volume supports its viability for detecting inclusions, enabling more
efficient, reliable, and automated quality control.

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP为可靠视觉语言应用开发提供了强大的评估工具，新发布的EYE4ALL数据集有助于开发更易访问的AI系统，特别是服务盲人和低视力人群。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击需要多次查询或训练扩散模型来生成对抗样本，这在现实场景中应用受限。需要开发更实用的攻击方法。

Method: 使用DNN的特征图，将其添加到干净图像中，通过特征表示来干扰目标模型的分类，实现单次查询攻击。

Result: ZQBA能在CIFAR和Tiny ImageNet数据集上实现跨模型攻击迁移，比现有单查询黑盒攻击更有效，同时保持扰动不可感知性。

Conclusion: ZQBA展示了DNN在现实应用中的脆弱性，提供了一种高效的黑盒对抗攻击方法，无需大量查询或复杂训练过程。

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性感知可解释分类器解决了概念瓶颈模型在性能和不确定性传播方面的局限性，同时保持了语义可解释性。

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

<details>

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在输入提示词发生微小语言变化时，难以保持语义一致性，暴露了推理和泛化能力的不足。

Method: 利用蜕变测试生成语义相同但语法不同的提示词对，直接比较生成的图像对来识别不一致性，分类对齐错误类型。

Result: 在多个最先进的T2I模型上评估，发现Flux.dev和DALLE-3分别有59%和71%的对齐失败率，揭示了现有模型在逻辑一致性方面的严重问题。

Conclusion: MetaLogic提供了一种可扩展、无需真实参考的评估方法，能有效发现现有评估指标忽略的细粒度逻辑不一致问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and

*Fan Yang,Zhiyang Chen,Yousong Zhu,Xin Li,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了TrajVLM-Gen两阶段框架，通过预测符合物理规律的运动轨迹来生成物理一致性的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型产生的运动在物理上不一致，违反了现实世界的动力学规律。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用视觉语言模型预测粗粒度运动轨迹；2) 基于注意力的机制进行细粒度运动精化。构建了基于视频跟踪数据的轨迹预测数据集。

Result: 在UCF-101和MSR-VTT数据集上表现优于现有方法，分别获得545和539的FVD分数。

Conclusion: TrajVLM-Gen能够生成物理一致性的视频，在视频质量评估指标上达到竞争性表现。

Abstract: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that
violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for
physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language
Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency
with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation
through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic
motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that
TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of
545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ADQA基准测试，用于评估音频描述在长视频片段中的质量，发现现有自动生成方法远不及人工创作，并量化了音频描述的主观性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动音频描述生成研究主要关注短片段，且仅与单一参考对比，忽略了音频描述的主观性本质。需要评估长视频片段中音频描述对盲人和低视力用户理解故事和欣赏视觉细节的帮助。

Method: 通过分析同一电影的两个独立音频描述轨道，量化描述时机、内容和重点的主观性。提出ADQA基准测试，包含视觉欣赏和叙事理解问题，评估长视频片段的音频描述质量。

Result: 发现当前音频描述生成方法在帮助用户理解故事和欣赏视觉细节方面远落后于人工创作的音频描述。量化了音频描述在何时描述、描述什么以及如何突出等方面的主观性。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的长视频音频描述生成方法，提出了公共排行榜用于基准测试，并给出了未来工作的建议。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

TL;DR: 提出了PhraseStereo数据集，这是首个将短语-区域分割扩展到立体图像对的短语接地数据集，通过GenStereo从单视图数据生成准确的右视图图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的短语接地方法主要局限于单视图图像，忽略了立体视觉中丰富的几何线索。

Method: 基于PhraseCut数据集，利用GenStereo生成准确的右视图图像，将短语接地扩展到立体领域。

Result: 创建了包含立体图像对、对齐分割掩码和短语标注的PhraseStereo数据集。

Conclusion: PhraseStereo为语言、视觉和3D感知交叉领域的研究奠定了基础，鼓励开发能够联合推理语义和几何的模型。

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

### [72] [NSARM: Next-Scale Autoregressive Modeling for Robust Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00820)
*Xiangtao Kong,Rongyuan Wu,Shuaizheng Liu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NSARM框架，结合自回归模型和两阶段训练方法，在真实图像超分辨率任务中实现高质量输出和快速推理，同时增强对输入图像质量的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实图像超分辨率方法存在速度与质量权衡问题：基于扩散模型的方法质量高但速度慢，直接输入的方法速度快但质量低，且现有方法对输入图像质量变化敏感。

Method: 使用视觉自回归模型，采用两阶段训练：首先训练变换网络将低质量图像映射到初步尺度，然后进行端到端全模型微调。

Result: NSARM在定量和定性评估中优于现有真实图像超分辨率方法，保持快速推理速度，且对输入图像质量具有更高鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: NSARM作为纯自回归模型，在真实图像超分辨率任务中实现了视觉质量、推理速度和鲁棒性的良好平衡。

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新颖的层次对比学习方法（HMLC），分别基于高斯混合模型（G-HMLC）和注意力机制（A-HMLC），在CIFAR100和ModelNet40数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类方法往往忽略不同层次间的类间关系，从而丢失重要的监督信号。需要显式建模层次间的类间关系和不平衡类别分布。

Method: 提出了两种层次对比学习方法：G-HMLC使用高斯混合模型，A-HMLC使用注意力机制来捕获层次特定特征，模拟人类处理过程。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ModelNet40数据集上，在线性评估中实现了最先进的性能，比现有的层次对比学习方法准确率提高了2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效建模层次间关系，在所有层次级别实现细粒度聚类，在计算机视觉等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探索了使用视频生成世界模型作为视觉编码器的新范式，提出了World-Language Models (WorldLMs)，其中最佳变体Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA)在空间推理任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着强大的视频基础模型的出现，研究它们是否能替代传统视觉编码器范式进行通用多模态理解，特别是系统性地探索生成世界模型在通用多模态任务中的潜力。

Method: 重新利用视频扩散模型作为生成编码器，执行单步去噪过程，并将得到的潜在表示作为视觉嵌入，构建World-Language Models (WorldLMs)。

Result: DyVA在空间推理能力上显著提升，使单图像模型能够进行多帧推理，在视觉推理任务中超越了开源和专有基线，达到最先进或相当的性能。

Conclusion: 生成编码器能够捕获对下游理解有用的潜在表示，这些表示与传统编码器有所不同，WorldLMs继承了视频预训练中的运动一致性内部化特性，为利用世界模型先验的新一代视觉语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GSMamba，一种结合Mamba选择性状态空间模型和移位窗口自注意力的混合架构，用于视频超分辨率，通过Gather-Scatter机制解决遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于RNN的VSR方法存在梯度消失、缺乏并行性和推理速度慢的问题，而Transformer虽然能建模全局上下文但复杂度高且难以处理长序列。Mamba提供了线性时间复杂度的替代方案，但单独使用时难以捕捉细粒度空间依赖。

Method: 提出混合架构：使用移位窗口自注意力进行空间上下文聚合，Mamba选择性扫描进行高效时间传播。引入Gather-Scatter Mamba机制，在Mamba传播前将特征向中心锚帧扭曲，传播后再散射回去，减少遮挡伪影。

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体实验结果。

Conclusion: GSMamba结合了Mamba的高效时间建模能力和自注意力的空间上下文聚合能力，通过Gather-Scatter机制有效解决了遮挡问题，为视频超分辨率提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AI-CNet3D的新型混合深度学习模型，通过将交叉注意力机制集成到3D CNN中，从OCT体积中提取关键特征，提高青光眼分类性能并增强可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统将3D OCT体积压缩为2D报告的做法会导致关键结构细节丢失，需要开发能够保留3D信息并提高青光眼诊断准确性的方法。

Method: 使用交叉注意力机制的3D CNN模型，通过沿两个轴分割体积并应用交叉注意力来捕捉半视网膜区域间的不对称性，同时整合视神经头和黄斑信息。引入CAREs进行可视化，并与Grad-CAMs对齐进行多任务微调。

Result: 在两个大型数据集上验证，模型在所有关键指标上优于最先进的注意力和卷积模型，计算效率高，参数数量减少100倍，同时保持高诊断性能和可比较的GFLOPS。

Conclusion: AI-CNet3D模型通过解剖学指导的交叉注意力网络有效提高了青光眼分类性能，同时增强了可解释性和计算效率。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过任务型调查探讨医学影像迁移学习中源数据集选择的问题，发现选择受任务依赖性、社区实践、数据集属性和相似性感知影响，挑战了"越相似越好"的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像迁移学习中源数据集选择通常依赖研究者直觉而非系统原则，这会影响算法的泛化性和患者预后，因此需要系统研究这些决策过程。

Method: 采用以人为中心的HCI视角，通过任务型调查与机器学习从业者进行访谈，不同于以往仅对模型和实验设置进行基准测试的方法。

Result: 发现源数据集选择是任务依赖性的，受社区实践、数据集属性和计算或感知相似性影响，但相似性评分与预期性能并不总是一致，参与者常使用模糊术语。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰的定义和HCI工具来明确这些启发式方法，为迁移学习中更系统的源选择提供实用见解。

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标注3D面部扫描的解剖标志点耗时且依赖专业知识，现有深度学习方法大多关注伪标志点或需要复杂输入表示，限制了临床适用性。

Method: 结合粗对齐、感兴趣区域过滤和初始标志点近似，使用基于补丁的点状CNN并增强注意力机制。

Result: 在214个健康成人标注扫描上，平均定位误差3.686mm，解剖距离误差2.822mm；在FaceScape数据集700个受试者上，点误差0.41mm，距离误差0.38mm。

Conclusion: PAL-Net在准确性和计算成本之间提供了有利的权衡，在大多数解剖区域表现出稳定准确性，为高通量3D人体测量分析提供了轻量级可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Conclusion: 提出的自监督学习策略在单次不完整观测模型下有效，为难以获取真实参考数据的逆问题提供了可行的学习解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出InfVSR方法，将视频超分辨率重新定义为自回归单步扩散范式，实现流式推理并充分利用预训练视频扩散先验，解决了长视频处理的效率和可扩展性问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在处理长序列时面临两个挑战：(1) 全序列多步去噪导致效率低下；(2) 时间分解导致伪影和不连续性，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 1) 将预训练DiT适配为因果结构，通过滚动KV缓存和联合视觉指导保持局部和全局一致性；2) 将扩散过程蒸馏为单步，采用分块像素监督和跨块分布匹配实现高效处理。

Result: 实现了无界长度视频的高效可扩展超分辨率，在新建的长视频基准上达到最先进质量，语义一致性增强，相比MGLD-VSR等方法速度提升高达58倍。

Conclusion: InfVSR突破了长视频超分辨率的边界，通过自回归单步扩散范式实现了高效、可扩展的处理，为长序列视频超分辨率提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

Motivation: 现代文本到图像生成主要依赖以标记为中心的架构，但文本与视觉标记的有效融合仍然是一个挑战。需要一种能够平衡条件强度与骨干网络通用性的方法。

Method: 将图像和文本编码为离散标记，使用联合嵌入预测Transformer处理。在特征预测器后加入交叉注意力进行条件去噪，同时在流匹配损失前注入原始文本嵌入以改善训练对齐。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的评估显示，JEPA-T实现了强大的数据效率和开放词汇泛化，持续优于非融合和后期融合基线方法。

Conclusion: 后期架构融合与目标级对齐相结合，在基于标记的文本到图像生成中提供了条件强度与骨干通用性之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

TL;DR: FastForward是一种视觉定位方法，通过单次前向传播同时创建地图表示并实时重定位查询图像，显著减少了建图时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法即使从已知相机姿态的建图图像开始，仍需要数小时到数分钟的建图时间，这限制了系统的实用性。

Method: 将多个建图图像表示为3D空间中锚定的特征集合，利用这些特征预测查询图像与场景的对应关系，从而估计相机姿态。

Result: 结合图像检索后，FastForward在最小化建图准备时间的同时达到了最先进的精度，并能很好地泛化到未见过的领域，包括具有挑战性的大规模室外环境。

Conclusion: FastForward证明了可以在保持竞争力的精度的同时，大幅加快视觉定位的速度，为实时应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

TL;DR: 提出一种即插即用的精炼模块，通过后预训练步骤联合优化自回归模型生成的所有视觉序列标记，增强视觉语言建模中的空间对应关系建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在视觉语言数据建模中存在空间视觉信号与顺序依赖预测之间的冲突，导致次优结果。

Method: 设计一个精炼模块作为后预训练步骤，利用全局上下文和标记间关系，联合优化所有生成的视觉序列标记。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了生成质量，增强了模型产生语义一致结果的能力。

Conclusion: 该精炼模块有效缓解了顺序生成中的错误累积问题，提升了视觉语言建模性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

TL;DR: 提出了SoftCFG方法解决自回归模型中分类器自由引导的两个关键问题：引导衰减和过度引导，通过不确定性加权引导和步长归一化来改善图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中应用分类器自由引导时面临引导衰减（条件-无条件差距随解码进程快速消失）和过度引导（强条件破坏视觉连贯性）的问题。

Method: 提出SoftCFG方法，通过不确定性加权在所有序列标记上分布自适应扰动，并引入步长归一化来限制累积扰动，稳定长序列生成。

Result: 实验表明SoftCFG显著优于标准CFG，在ImageNet 256上实现了自回归模型中最先进的FID分数。

Conclusion: SoftCFG是一种无需训练、模型无关的方法，能无缝集成到现有自回归流程中，有效解决CFG在AR模型中的应用问题。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextCAM是一种新颖的解释框架，通过将CAM与视觉语言模型结合，为深度视觉模型提供包含自然语言的语义解释，既能定位关注区域又能描述视觉属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CAM方法虽然能高亮空间区域，但缺乏对这些激活区域背后语义属性的理解，限制了模型在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 结合CAM的精确空间定位和视觉语言模型的语义对齐能力，使用CLIP嵌入和线性判别分析获取通道级语义表示，并与CAM权重聚合生成文本描述。

Result: 在ImageNet、CLEVR和CUB数据集上的实验表明，TextCAM能产生忠实且可解释的推理，提高人类理解能力，检测虚假相关性，并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: TextCAM通过融合空间定位和语义描述，为深度视觉模型提供了更全面和可解释的解释框架。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频问答方法虽然能处理1500+帧，但仅对应50秒视频且信息损失严重，需要更高效的视频压缩和问答方法。

Method: 使用运动模糊和加权平均变体将每秒视频压缩为单帧，构建1fps输入源，在ReasonVQA数据集上对QWEN-2.5-VL 7B进行SFT和DPO训练。

Result: 在ReasonVQA数据集上，F1分数从0.212提升至0.543，BLEU-4从0.031提升至0.291，ROUGE-L从0.196提升至0.528，推理质量显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同池化方案下均保持性能增益，在TVQA数据集上零样本测试也表现良好，表明对时间证据总结具有强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

TL;DR: ImageDoctor是一个统一的多方面文本到图像模型评估框架，通过四个维度评估图像质量并提供像素级缺陷热图，可作为密集奖励用于模型偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用单一标量量化生成图像质量，无法提供全面可解释的反馈。需要更全面的评估框架来支持文本到图像模型的偏好对齐。

Method: 引入"观察-思考-预测"范式：先定位潜在缺陷，生成推理，最后给出定量评分。基于视觉语言模型，结合监督微调和强化学习训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上与人类偏好高度一致，作为奖励模型时比标量奖励模型提升10%的生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageDoctor作为评估指标有效，作为奖励模型能显著提升文本到图像模型的生成质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的高光谱分类模型对抗攻击脆弱性高，现有防御方法依赖定制化设计，可扩展性差且无法有效防御强攻击。

Method: 引入对抗训练到高光谱领域，提出AT-RA方法，通过数据增强增加光谱信息多样性，确保空间平滑性来保护和校正光谱语义信息。

Result: AT-RA方法使对抗鲁棒性在AutoAttack下提升21.34%，在PGD-50下提升18.78%，同时良性准确率提升2.68%。

Conclusion: AT-RA方法有效解决了高光谱数据特有的挑战，显著提升了模型的对抗鲁棒性，同时保持了良好的分类性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸匿名化方法难以在安全性、图像质量和可逆性之间取得良好平衡，扩散模型缺乏密钥机制来确保只有授权方能够逆转匿名化过程。

Method: 将密钥与扩散模型的潜在人脸表示相结合，使用面部掩码约束生成以保留身份无关特征，通过确定性前向和后向扩散过程确保原始人脸可恢复。

Result: 该方法生成的人脸匿名化图像与原始人脸视觉相似度更低，同时保持了高质量图像生成和可逆性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在安全性、图像质量和可逆性方面优于现有工作，为保护人脸隐私提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

TL;DR: 提出了Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD)框架，直接在one-hot空间保持扩散特性，通过协调机制重新定义伪离散扩散方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统伪离散扩散方法依赖连续潜在空间扩散或掩码策略，ADD旨在直接在one-hot空间保持核心扩散特性

Method: 使用浮点编码的one-hot类数据作为扩散输入，引入时间步条件交叉熵损失，在扩散模型输出和原始one-hot标签之间建立连接

Result: 在分类任务上表现优于基线，在图像描述任务上展现出优秀的文本生成能力

Conclusion: ADD通过协同设计在判别性和生成性学习之间建立桥梁，各组件均带来可衡量的性能提升

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法在语义上受限于预定义关系集，且在大环境中序列化容易超出LLM上下文窗口，需要更通用和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 构建包含楼层、房间、对象和功能元素的层次化图结构，通过优化几何和视觉覆盖的关键帧提取多模态信息，使用分层RAG管道从图中提取相关上下文。

Result: 在四个基准测试（包括3D对象分割和复杂查询检索）中，KeySG在大多数指标上优于先前方法，展示了其优越的语义丰富性和效率。

Conclusion: KeySG通过层次化图表示和关键帧选择，有效解决了3D场景图的语义限制和可扩展性问题，为复杂环境中的机器人推理和规划提供了强大工具。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks --including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval-- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在自动驾驶系统中应用日益增多，但幻觉问题限制了其在安全关键流程中的可靠性，需要一种能够校准模型输出的融合方法。

Method: 使用博弈论融合方法，学习每个模型、每个标签在上下文条件下的可靠性，将模型报告转换为带协议保护的似然比，结合上下文先验和基于Shapley值的声誉状态更新，生成可校准的后验概率。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

Conclusion: Code2Video展示了作为可扩展、可解释和可控方法的潜力，为教育视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The

Motivation: 受人类在先前体验过的3D环境中进行心理探索和回放能力的启发，旨在实现空间一致的长时程探索。

Method: 首先通过具有细粒度视图控制的视频生成器生成未来视频帧，然后使用前馈即插即用transformer演化场景的3D重建，最后基于从演化显式3D记忆的几何重投影来合成未来帧。

Result: 在合成户外环境、Habitat室内场景和挑战性真实世界场景的基准测试中，演化3D记忆显著提高了视觉保真度并保持了空间场景一致性。

Conclusion: 演化3D记忆相比现有方法在视觉真实性和空间一致性方面有显著提升，代表了长时程空间一致世界建模的重要进展。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are
publicly available at https://github.com/XWH-A/IMAGEdit.
