### [1] [SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901)
*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimULi是一种能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的神经渲染方法，解决了现有方法渲染速度慢、仅支持针孔相机模型以及跨传感器不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）渲染速度慢或仅支持针孔相机模型，无法满足自动驾驶等应用中需要高畸变镜头和LiDAR数据的需求，且存在跨传感器不一致问题。

Method: 扩展3DGUT以支持LiDAR，采用自动分块策略处理任意旋转LiDAR模型和基于光线的剔除，设计因子化3D高斯表示和锚定策略来解决跨传感器不一致问题。

Result: SimULi比光线追踪方法快10-20倍，比现有基于光栅化的方法快1.5-10倍，且支持更广泛的相机模型。在两个自动驾驶数据集上的评估显示，其在多个相机和LiDAR指标上达到或超过现有最先进方法的保真度。

Conclusion: SimULi是首个能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，显著提高了渲染速度并解决了跨传感器不一致问题，在自动驾驶测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [2] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出SurgFUTR方法，将手术未来预测重新定义为状态变化学习，通过教师-学生架构和Action Dynamics模块，在多个数据集上实现跨程序的通用预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术AI研究主要关注理解正在发生的事件，而非预测未来事件。现有方法针对孤立任务，缺乏统一方法，且难以在不同手术环境和程序中泛化。

Method: 提出SurgFUTR方法，通过状态变化学习框架，使用教师-学生架构和Sinkhorn-Knopp聚类压缩视频为状态表示，ActDyn模块指导学生网络从当前视频预测未来状态。

Result: 在四个数据集和三种手术程序上的实验显示一致改进，跨程序迁移验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: 通过状态变化学习框架，SurgFUTR在手术未来预测任务中实现了更好的性能和跨程序泛化能力。

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [3] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TMPS框架，通过目标感知度量学习和优先采样，使用少量目标域样本显著提升植物病害诊断模型在未知环境下的泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习植物病害诊断系统在训练环境外图像上表现不佳，主要由于病害症状的细微变化和领域差异，需要提高模型在未知部署环境下的鲁棒性

Method: TMPS框架基于度量学习，假设可获得少量目标域标记样本，通过目标感知度量学习和优先采样策略有效利用这些样本来提升诊断鲁棒性

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像的大规模数据集上测试，仅使用每病害10个目标域样本，TMPS相比基线方法平均宏F1分数分别提升7.3和3.6个百分点，相比传统度量学习提升17.1-18.7个百分点

Conclusion: TMPS是一个简单但高度自适应的学习框架，能够有效利用少量目标域样本显著提升植物病害诊断模型在未知环境下的泛化性能

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

### [4] [Unifying Vision-Language Latents for Zero-label Image Caption Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12931)
*Sanghyun Byun,Jung Ick Guack,Mohanad Odema,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer是一个无需标签的视觉语言对齐增强框架，通过在训练中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，使现有VLM无需文本标签或完整重训练即可生成改进的图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖标注图像数据集，限制了可扩展性并导致大量未标注图像数据未被充分利用。

Method: 提出统一视觉语言对齐的零标签增强框架，在训练过程中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，无需依赖人工或合成标注数据集。

Result: 在SmolVLM-Base和Qwen2-VL上的应用显示，ViZer在定性评估中产生更接地气和描述性更强的图像描述，尽管自动指标如CIDEr和BERTScore可能惩罚参考描述中缺失的细节。

Conclusion: ViZer为零标签视觉语言任务提供了一个实用的起点，能够在不依赖文本标签的情况下持续提升图像描述质量。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

### [5] [Epistemic-aware Vision-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12953)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FetalMind是一个专门针对胎儿超声的医疗AI系统，通过引入显著认知解耦(SED)方法和构建FetalSigma-1M数据集，在报告生成和诊断任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗视觉语言模型主要针对结构化成人影像，在胎儿超声领域表现不佳，因为胎儿超声面临多视图推理、疾病种类繁多和图像多样性等挑战。

Method: 提出显著认知解耦(SED)方法，将专家构建的二部图注入模型，解耦视图-疾病关联，并通过强化学习引导临床偏好选择。同时构建了首个大规模胎儿超声报告数据集FetalSigma-1M。

Result: FetalMind在所有孕周阶段均优于开源和闭源基线，平均提升14%，在关键病症上的准确率提高61.2%，同时保持高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FetalMind通过临床工作流指导的方法设计，有效解决了胎儿超声领域的特定挑战，为医疗AI在该领域的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [6] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5是一个用于SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的采样器级引导堆栈，通过ZeResFDG模块统一频率解耦引导、能量重缩放和零投影技术，结合轻量级频谱EMA和QSilk微颗粒稳定器，在不重新训练的情况下提升图像清晰度、提示遵循度和伪影控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型在采样过程中存在的图像模糊、提示遵循度不足和伪影问题，同时保持适度的引导尺度而不需要重新训练模型。

Method: 核心模块ZeResFDG结合了频率解耦引导（重加权高低频分量）、能量重缩放（匹配引导预测的幅度）和零投影（移除无条件方向的分量）。使用轻量级频谱EMA在采样过程中切换保守和细节寻求模式。此外，采用QSilk微颗粒稳定器进行推理时稳定化处理。

Result: 在SD/SDXL采样器上，ZeResFDG在适度引导尺度下显著改善了图像清晰度、提示遵循度和伪影控制，QSilk稳定器提高了鲁棒性并在高分辨率下产生自然的高频微纹理。

Conclusion: CADE 2.5提供了一个有效的采样器级引导解决方案，无需重新训练即可显著提升SD/SDXL模型的图像质量，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

*Tianyu Zhang,Suyuchen Wang,Chao Wang,Juan Rodriguez,Ahmed Masry,Xiangru Jian,Yoshua Bengio,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE是一个混合编码器框架，通过实例级路由动态选择专用编码器，相比传统堆叠编码器方法，在减少24-49%计算量的同时实现更好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视觉编码器的VLMs存在计算成本高且收益递减的问题，需要更智能的编码器选择机制。

Method: 使用共享编码器+路由编码器池，通过轻量级路由器基于文本提示和共享视觉特征的交叉注意力来选择最优编码器，采用双熵正则化和辅助损失训练路由器。

Result: 仅使用1个共享+1个路由编码器的SCOPE优于同时使用4个额外编码器的模型，计算量减少24-49%。

Conclusion: 智能编码器选择优于暴力聚合方法，挑战了多编码器VLMs的主流范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

*Tanveer Hannan,Shuaicong Wu,Mark Weber,Suprosanna Shit,Jindong Gu,Rajat Koner,Aljoša Ošep,Laura Leal-Taixé,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了时空视频动作定位(SVAG)新任务，要求模型基于自然语言描述同时检测、跟踪和时间定位视频中的目标对象，并构建了大规模基准SVAG-Bench和基线框架SVAGFormer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解方法主要关注粗粒度动作识别或通用目标跟踪，忽视了基于动作联合检测和跟踪多个对象并对其进行时间定位的挑战。

Method: 提出SVAGFormer基线框架，适配最先进的视觉语言模型进行联合空间和时间定位，并开发SVAGEval标准化评估工具包。

Result: 实证结果显示现有模型在SVAG任务上表现不佳，特别是在密集或复杂场景中，突显了在长视频中进行细粒度对象-动作交互推理的必要性。

Conclusion: SVAG任务对下一代AI系统至关重要，现有方法在该任务上的不足表明需要开发更先进的细粒度对象-动作交互推理能力。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

*Zhengxu Tang,Zizheng Wang,Luning Wang,Zitao Shuai,Chenhao Zhang,Siyu Qian,Yirui Wu,Bohao Wang,Haosong Rao,Zhenyu Yang,Chenwei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SeqBench基准，用于评估文本到视频生成中的序列叙事连贯性，包含320个提示和2560个人工标注视频，并设计了基于动态时序图的自动评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型在创建视觉吸引力视频方面取得进展，但在生成需要逻辑推进多个事件的连贯序列叙事方面存在困难，现有基准主要关注视觉质量指标而未能评估长序列的叙事连贯性。

Method: 设计了包含320个提示的SeqBench数据集，涵盖不同叙事复杂度，使用8个最先进的T2V模型生成2560个视频并人工标注。开发了基于动态时序图的自动评估指标，能高效捕捉长程依赖和时序顺序。

Result: 基于DTG的指标与人工标注有强相关性。系统评估揭示了当前T2V模型的关键局限性：在多动作序列中无法保持一致的物体状态、在多物体场景中产生物理上不合理的结果、难以保持顺序动作之间的现实时序和顺序关系。

Conclusion: SeqBench为评估T2V生成中的叙事连贯性提供了首个系统框架，并为改进未来模型的序列推理能力提供了具体见解。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneAdapt是一个通过两阶段适应（中间帧生成和场景感知中间帧生成）将场景感知注入文本条件运动模型的框架，利用不相交的场景-运动和文本-运动数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成方法要么处理运动语义，要么处理场景感知，但缺乏同时具备丰富文本-运动覆盖和精确场景交互的大规模数据集。

Method: 使用运动中间帧生成作为代理任务来桥接两个不同的数据集，包括关键帧层调制运动潜在空间和场景条件层通过交叉注意力注入场景几何信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SceneAdapt有效地将场景感知注入文本到运动模型中。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了同时处理运动语义和场景感知的挑战，代码和模型将发布。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在处理长序列心电图信号时性能有限，需要更有效的序列建模方法来提高心电图异常检测的准确性。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络进行特征提取，结合Mamba选择性状态空间模型进行序列建模，基于Vision Mamba的双向变体增强时间依赖关系表示。

Result: 在PhysioNet 2020和2021挑战赛数据集上，该模型在12导联心电图上的AUPRC和AUROC得分显著优于之前发表的最佳算法。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的架构有潜力推动可靠的心电图分类，支持早期诊断和个性化治疗，同时提高远程医疗和资源受限医疗系统的可及性。

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

### [12] [True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13063)
*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是第一个无需几何先验、能够实现真正新颖视角合成的自监督模型，通过成对姿态估计和输入输出增强方案，成功解耦相机姿态与场景内容，实现了姿态的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督新颖视角合成方法预测的姿态缺乏可迁移性，即相同的姿态表示在不同3D场景中会产生不同的相机轨迹，无法实现真正的视角合成。

Method: 结合成对姿态估计与输入输出增强方案，无需3D归纳偏置或多视图几何概念，使用无约束的潜在姿态变量来解耦相机姿态与场景内容。

Result: XFactor显著优于先前的无姿态NVS变换器，实现了姿态的可迁移性，且潜在姿态与现实世界姿态高度相关。

Conclusion: XFactor证明了无需显式3D几何表示即可实现真正的新颖视角合成，为自监督3D理解提供了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

### [13] [Direction-aware multi-scale gradient loss for infrared and visible image fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13067)
*Kaixuan Yang,Wei Xiang,Zhenshuai Chen,Tong Jin,Yunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种方向感知的多尺度梯度损失函数，通过分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量并保留其符号信息，解决了传统梯度幅度损失中方向信息丢失的问题，从而提升了红外与可见光图像融合的边缘清晰度和纹理保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的图像融合方法通常使用梯度幅度损失，但这种做法会丢失梯度的方向信息，导致监督信号模糊和边缘保真度不足。

Method: 引入方向感知的多尺度梯度损失，分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量，并在多尺度上保持其符号信息，不改变模型架构或训练协议。

Result: 在开源模型和多个公共基准测试上的实验表明，该方法能有效提升边缘清晰度、对齐精度和纹理保持能力。

Conclusion: 方向感知的梯度损失为图像融合提供了更清晰的定向指导，显著改善了融合质量，且易于集成到现有方法中。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的无监督域自适应框架，专门解决MRI海马体分割中的域偏移问题，结合风格归一化和双向可变形图像配准，在跨域分割任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在不同数据集间部署时面临域偏移问题，包括图像外观（风格）和人群相关的解剖特征（内容）的变化，特别是在海马体分割任务中。

Method: 结合z归一化进行高效风格协调，采用双向可变形图像配准策略，将配准网络与分割网络和判别器网络联合训练，生成解剖学上合理的变换来对齐源图像到目标域。

Result: 在合成数据集和三个MRI海马体数据集上的全面评估表明，该方法在所有实验中均优于现有基线。从年轻健康人群迁移到临床痴呆患者时，Dice分数相对标准增强方法提高了15%，在内容偏移显著的情况下效果最佳。

Conclusion: 该框架在多样化人群中实现了准确的海马体分割，特别适用于存在显著内容偏移的场景。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

TL;DR: 该论文针对扩散概率模型中的计数幻觉问题，构建了CountHalluSet数据集和标准化评估协议，系统分析了采样条件对计数幻觉的影响，并发现FID等常用指标无法有效捕捉此类幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然取得了显著进展，但经常产生与现实世界知识冲突的幻觉样本，特别是计数幻觉（如生成六根手指的手）。目前缺乏系统量化这些幻觉的方法，阻碍了解决这一挑战的进展。

Method: 构建包含ToyShape、SimObject和RealHand的CountHalluSet数据集，建立标准化评估协议，系统分析不同采样条件（求解器类型、ODE求解器阶数、采样步数、初始噪声）对计数幻觉的影响。

Result: 研究发现不同采样条件显著影响计数幻觉水平，且广泛使用的FID图像质量指标无法一致地捕捉计数幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 这项工作为系统量化扩散模型中的幻觉现象迈出了第一步，为图像生成中幻觉现象的研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

TL;DR: Edit-Your-Interest是一个轻量级的零样本视频编辑方法，通过时空特征记忆库和特征最相似传播技术，在保持时间一致性的同时显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在计算开销大、内存消耗高的问题，并且常常牺牲视觉保真度，导致时间不一致性和伪影。

Method: 提出时空特征记忆库(SFM)缓存特征，特征最相似传播(FMP)保持时间一致性，以及SFM更新算法确保特征长期有效性。利用交叉注意力图自动提取感兴趣实例的掩码。

Result: 在效率和视觉保真度方面均优于现有最先进方法，验证了其优越的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: Edit-Your-Interest通过创新的特征缓存和传播机制，实现了高效、高质量的零样本视频编辑，解决了现有方法在计算开销和时间一致性方面的限制。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: 提出了EgoSocial数据集和EgoSoD方法，用于解决AR/VR环境中AI助手在社交互动中何时干预的问题，显著提升了干预时机检测和社交互动感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs缺乏社交意识，在AR/VR环境中会不断发出社交无知的响应，干扰自然对话并影响用户专注度，需要AI能够理解以自我为中心的社交动态。

Method: 构建了包含13,500个社交视频-问题对的大规模EgoSocial数据集，并提出EgoSoD方法，该方法整合多模态上下文线索到社交思维图中，动态建模参与者和互动。

Result: 实验显示当前OLLMs在检测干预时机方面表现不佳（Gemini 2.5 Pro仅14.4%），而EgoSoD方法将Phi-4的干预时机性能提升45.6%，Gemini 2.5 Pro提升9.9%；社交互动整体性能分别提升20.4%和6.9%。

Conclusion: EgoSoD方法能有效检测干预时机和社交互动，精确确定何时干预，解决了AI助手在社交环境中的响应时机问题。

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Conclusion: 该工作为评估自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠、与人类判断一致的基础框架。

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有的网格生成和微分同胚图像配准方法，旨在实现优异的配准精度同时控制变换质量，确保空间变换的正雅可比行列式，并提供精确的逆变换近似，这对神经影像工作流程至关重要。

Method: 基于变分原理(VP)的网格生成方法，构建具有规定雅可比行列式和旋度的无折叠网格，在微分同胚群中生成逆变换而非图像空间操作，保证微分同胚空间变换。

Result: 在OASIS-1数据集的150个脑部扫描配准中，基于35个感兴趣区域的Dice分数评估显示，VPreg在Dice分数、计算变换的规律性、逆映射的准确性和一致性方面均优于ANTs-SyN、Freesurfer-Easyreg和FSL-Fnirt等最先进方法。

Conclusion: VPreg通过变分原理方法在微分同胚图像配准中表现出色，提供了更高质量的变换和更准确的逆映射，在计算解剖学和形态测量学中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Method: 1) 设计不依赖任务领域显式知识的提示模板，利用LLM增强文本模态的多义性描述；2) 使用超图适配器构建文本与图像模态间的多边连接，修正同义语义的正负匹配误差并减少开放语义熵带来的噪声。

Result: 在Flickr30K和MS-COCO基准测试中，文本到图像检索性能提升16.8%，图像到文本检索性能提升40.1%，在语义对齐任务中建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: OS-HGAdapter通过利用LLM的开放语义知识和超图适配器，有效解决了跨模态检索中的信息熵不平衡问题，显著提升了语义对齐性能。

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习去噪模型大多在模拟或单一真实场景数据上训练，忽略了不同地理区域噪声特性的显著差异，导致模型在新环境中性能下降。

Method: 首先通过字典学习将TEM信号的固有物理特性(如指数衰减和平滑性)编码为字典驱动先验，在训练时集成到模型中。测试时，该先验通过最小化字典驱动一致性和信号一阶变化的自监督损失，指导模型动态适应新环境。

Conclusion: 提出的DP-TTA方法通过利用TEM信号的固有物理特性作为先验知识，有效提升了模型在不同地理环境下的去噪性能，解决了跨环境适应性差的问题。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Motivation: 传统边缘资源管理方法强调通信吞吐量或通用学习性能，但EGS明确旨在最大化高斯泼溅质量，现有方法不适用。需要解决客户端图像贡献异质性和因果困境问题。

Method: 提出STT-GS策略：首先从每个客户端采样图像子集作为试点数据用于损失预测，然后基于评估结果优先分配通信资源给更有价值的客户端。采用特征域聚类选择代表性数据，试点传输时间最小化减少开销。开发基于惩罚交替主化最小化算法的联合客户端选择和功率控制框架。

Result: 在真实数据集上显著优于现有基准方法。GS导向目标函数可以在低采样率（如10%）下准确预测，实现了视图贡献和通信成本之间的良好权衡。

Conclusion: 所提出的方案有效解决了EGS中的资源分配问题，通过智能采样和资源优化显著提升了高斯泼溅质量，同时控制了通信开销。

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception

fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

### [27] [MimicParts: Part-aware Style Injection for Speech-Driven 3D Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13208)
*Lianlian Liu,YongKang He,Zhaojie Chu,Xiaofen Xing,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MimicParts框架，通过部位感知风格注入和去噪网络，从语音生成更具表现力的3D人体运动，解决了现有方法忽略区域运动风格差异和动态适应语音节奏变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于语音生成3D人体运动的方法存在两个主要问题：一是风格编码方法要么过度简化风格多样性，要么忽略区域运动风格差异（如上身与下身）；二是运动风格应该动态适应语音节奏和情绪变化，但现有方法往往忽略这一点。

Method: 提出MimicParts框架，采用部位感知风格注入和部位感知去噪网络。将身体划分为不同区域来编码局部运动风格，并通过部位感知注意力块让节奏和情绪线索精确指导每个身体区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在自然性和表现力方面优于现有方法，能够生成更自然的3D人体运动序列。

Conclusion: MimicParts框架通过捕捉细粒度区域差异和动态适应语音变化，显著提升了基于语音的3D人体运动生成的质量和表现力。

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

TL;DR: 这篇综述系统梳理了视觉提示(VP)和视觉提示调优(VPT)方法，提出了统一的提示式适应(PA)框架，并对现有方法进行了分类和整合分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究中VP和VPT概念边界模糊，经常被互换使用，缺乏系统性的区分和统一框架来理解这些技术及其应用。

Method: 从第一性原理重新审视VP和VPT设计，提出统一的提示式适应(PA)框架，按可学习性(可学习、生成式、不可学习)和注入粒度(像素级、token级)对方法进行分类。

Result: 建立了PA方法的系统分类体系，考察了PA在医学影像、3D点云、视觉语言任务等领域的应用，以及在测试时适应和可信AI中的作用。

Conclusion: 这是首个专门针对PA方法论和应用的全面综述，为研究人员提供了清晰的路线图，帮助理解PA相关研究的发展格局。

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向工业表面缺陷检测的样本中心多任务学习框架，通过联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位，解决了传统像素中心方法在样本级决策稳定性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测面临极端的前景-背景不平衡、缺陷稀疏且尺度分布长尾、低对比度等问题。现有模型虽然在像素重叠指标上表现良好，但在样本级决策稳定性上不足，特别是对于稀疏或细长缺陷。

Method: 采用共享编码器架构的多任务学习框架，联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位。样本级监督调节特征分布，在梯度层面持续提升小缺陷和低对比度缺陷的召回率，分割分支保留边界和形状细节。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了样本级决策的可靠性和缺陷定位的完整性。

Conclusion: 样本中心的多任务学习框架能够有效解决工业表面缺陷检测中的样本级决策稳定性问题，提出的决策关联评估指标更符合实际质量控制需求。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

*Inha Kang,Youngsun Lim,Seonho Lee,Jiho Choi,Junsuk Choe,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对视觉语言模型在否定理解上的缺陷，提出了CoVAND数据集和NegToMe模块，通过改进token化过程和参数高效微调，显著提升了否定检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在理解否定时存在严重的肯定偏见，特别是在描述性目标检测任务中表现不佳，这限制了模型在现实世界检测应用中的可靠性。

Method: 提出了两个主要贡献：(1) CoVAND数据集，使用链式思维和VQA管道生成高质量的实例接地否定数据；(2) NegToMe模块，通过文本token合并直接解决肯定偏见的架构原因，将否定词与属性绑定成连贯的语义短语。

Result: 该方法在具有挑战性的否定基准测试中显著提升了性能，将NMS-AP在OVDEval上提升了高达+10.8个百分点，并降低了误报率，同时展示了在先进视觉语言模型上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作在解决现实世界检测应用中的否定理解问题上迈出了关键一步，通过直接处理否定线索在token化过程中的结构丢失问题，实现了更鲁棒的否定理解。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

TL;DR: UniVector是一个统一的矢量提取框架，能够在单一模型中提取多种矢量类型（多边形、折线、线段），通过实例-几何交互机制实现跨级别上下文交换，并在多结构矢量提取任务中达到新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矢量提取方法通常只针对单一矢量类型设计，需要为不同结构使用独立模型，这限制了捕捉复杂结构的能力。

Method: 提出UniVector框架，将矢量编码为包含实例和几何信息的结构化查询，通过交互模块进行迭代更新，并引入动态形状约束来优化全局结构和关键点。

Result: 在单结构和多结构矢量提取任务上均达到了新的最先进水平，并发布了包含多种矢量类型的Multi-Vector数据集。

Conclusion: UniVector通过统一的实例-几何交互机制，成功实现了在单一模型中提取多种矢量类型，为矢量提取领域提供了更高效和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型的静态文本描述，缺乏对实时目标状态变化的适应性且容易产生幻觉，需要更灵活的动态目标建模方法。

Method: 使用显式提示将空间运动信息转换为自然语言描述提供时空指导，隐式提示结合伪词和可学习描述符构建个性化知识表示，通过CLIP文本编码器动态调整，并设计判别性特征增强器来增强视觉和跨模态表示。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的广泛实验表明，EPIPTrack在多样化场景中优于现有跟踪器，展现出强大的适应性和优越性能。

Conclusion: EPIPTrack通过显式和隐式提示的统一框架有效解决了多模态跟踪中的动态目标建模问题，为实时目标状态变化提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型的对抗性补丁攻击(EDPA)和相应的防御策略，EDPA是一种模型无关的攻击方法，通过破坏视觉和文本潜在表示的语义对齐来干扰VLA模型，同时提出了对抗性微调防御方案。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在机器人学习领域取得了革命性进展，但其对抗鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究VLA模型的对抗脆弱性并提出相应的防御策略。

Method: 提出了嵌入破坏补丁攻击(EDPA)，这是一种模型无关的对抗攻击方法，通过(i)破坏视觉和文本潜在表示的语义对齐，以及(ii)最大化对抗性和干净视觉输入之间潜在表示的差异来构造补丁。同时提出了针对视觉编码器的对抗性微调防御方案。

Result: 在LIBERO机器人仿真基准测试上的广泛评估表明，EDPA显著提高了最先进VLA模型的任务失败率，而提出的防御策略有效缓解了这种性能下降。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了VLA模型在对抗攻击下的脆弱性，提出的EDPA攻击和对抗性微调防御为提升VLA模型的鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at

Abstract: The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) applications in urban environments heavily relies on the availability of
large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,
depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including
varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research
on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

Conclusion: 提出的网络在嵌入式系统上实现了超实时的人群计数性能，同时保持了有竞争力的准确率，推理速度是目前最快的。

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

Motivation: 尽管视频大语言模型在视频问答任务上取得进展，但其内部如何提取和传播视频与文本信息的机制仍未被充分探索。本研究旨在揭示VideoLLMs的内部信息流机制。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析VideoLLMs的内部信息流，研究不同VideoQA任务中的信息传播模式。

Result: 发现VideoLLMs在时空推理中存在一致模式：早期到中间层进行跨帧交互，中间层实现视频-语言集成，中后层生成正确答案。通过选择有效信息通路，可以大幅减少注意力边（如58%）而保持性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解VideoLLMs如何执行时空推理提供了蓝图，并为提高模型可解释性和下游泛化能力提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

<details>

Motivation: 当前端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了多模态的联合表示学习。

Method: 利用Mamba-based多步选择扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器渐进生成和精炼模态特定信息，实现编码和解码的统一。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一了多模态处理过程，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

Method: 构建包含8个任务、6个上下文长度区间和多种模态（文本、图像、视频）的MMLongCite基准

Result: 评估显示最先进的LVLMs在处理长多模态上下文时的忠实度有限，分析了上下文长度和关键内容位置对模型忠实度的影响

Conclusion: 需要改进LVLMs在长多模态上下文中的忠实度，MMLongCite为这一研究方向提供了重要基准

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

### [40] [Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Masked Degradation Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13282)
*JiaKui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Lujia Jin,Yinghao Chen,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaskDCPT预训练方法，通过退化类型分类和图像重建的双重监督，实现通用图像恢复任务的预训练，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法在图像恢复任务中存在局限性，需要一种能够同时处理多种退化类型并具有强泛化能力的预训练方法。

Method: 使用编码器和两个解码器：编码器从掩码低质量图像提取特征，分类解码器识别退化类型，重建解码器重建高质量图像，结合掩码图像建模和对比学习。

Result: 在5D全合一恢复任务中PSNR至少提升3.77dB，真实场景中PIQE降低34.8%，对未见过的退化类型和级别表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaskDCPT是一种简单而有效的预训练方法，可为通用图像恢复任务提供强大的基础表示，并发布了包含250万样本的UIR-2.5M数据集。

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at
https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT.

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动文档分类系统，能够检测图像中的文本内容并将文档分类为发票、报告、信件和表格四类，支持离线图像和实时摄像头捕获。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中面临的多种挑战，包括光照变化、任意方向、弯曲或部分遮挡文本、低分辨率和远距离文本等问题。

Method: 采用四阶段流水线：图像采集与预处理、使用DBNet++进行文本检测、使用BART分类器进行文本分类，所有功能集成在基于Python和PyQt5的用户界面中。

Result: 在Total-Text数据集上经过10小时测试，文本检测准确率达到92.88%，该数据集包含高分辨率图像并模拟各种困难场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在无约束成像场景下对混合来源的文档分类具有实际有效性。

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual
content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories
(Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images
(e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via
connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as
variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded
text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages:
image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution
images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate
the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构因果模型的3D点云新类发现分割方法，通过因果表示和推理联合学习来解决基类到新类的分割问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云新类发现分割任务中基类和新类之间的表示关联问题，避免统计相关性学习导致的新类推理混淆。

Method: 使用结构因果模型(SCM)重新形式化3D-NCD问题，设计因果表示原型消除混杂因子，并通过图结构建模基类和新类之间的因果关系。

Result: 在3D和2D NCD语义分割任务上的大量实验和可视化结果证明了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过引入因果表示和推理的联合学习，能够准确发现基类和新类之间的本质关联，有效解决3D点云新类发现分割问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

*Jiankun Zhong,Zitong Zhan,Quankai Gao,Ziyu Chen,Haozhe Lou,Jiageng Mao,Ulrich Neumann,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GPU并行计算的SfM方法，在保持重建精度的同时实现了40倍加速，解决了传统SfM方法计算开销大和深度学习SfM方法内存消耗高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法（如COLMAP、GLOMAP）在大型场景中存在显著计算开销，在精度和速度之间需要权衡；而基于深度学习的SfM方法（如VGGSfM、VGGT）无法扩展到数千张输入图像，GPU内存消耗随输入视图数量急剧增加。

Method: 利用GPU并行计算加速标准SfM管线的每个关键阶段，基于稀疏感知的束调整优化技术，在统一的全局SfM框架中同时加速BA和GP。

Result: 在不同规模数据集上的实验表明，相比COLMAP实现了约40倍的加速，同时保持了相当甚至更好的重建精度，能够处理5000张图像的大规模场景。

Conclusion: 该方法成功释放了GPU并行计算的潜力，在保持重建质量的同时显著提升了SfM的计算效率，解决了现有方法在大规模场景中的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的解码策略，通过查询相关的视觉增强和自适应阈值算法来减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉对比解码方法使用通用的视觉增强，忽视了文本查询的具体上下文，限制了其有效性

Method: 1. 自增强提示策略：利用模型内在知识动态对齐查询和视觉增强的语义；2. 自适应阈值算法：基于输出稀疏性自适应调整下一个token候选大小

Result: 在4个LVLM和7个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进的解码方法显著提高了事实一致性

Conclusion: 整合查询相关的增强和熵感知解码对于提升LVLM的有效生成至关重要

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

Motivation: 日常生活中视觉内容对注意力的吸引至关重要，研究旨在探索大型多模态模型是否能够理解视觉趣味性概念及其与人类评估的对齐程度。

Method: 通过比较分析研究GPT-4o与人类在视觉趣味性评估上的对齐程度，并利用模型预测生成图像对标签数据，用于训练学习排序模型。

Result: 研究发现GPT-4o与人类在视觉趣味性评估上存在部分对齐，其表现优于现有最先进方法，能够有效标注图像对的趣味性。

Conclusion: 该研究为深入理解人类兴趣提供了途径，展示了大型多模态模型在视觉趣味性理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种训练策略，可以在训练过程中移除光流估计器中的成本体积，从而显著提高推理速度并减少内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成本体积在现代光流估计器中普遍使用，但其计算和空间复杂度限制了处理速度和输入帧的分辨率。经验观察发现，一旦其他网络部分充分训练后，成本体积的重要性会降低。

Method: 引入一种训练策略，允许在训练过程中移除光流估计器中的成本体积。基于此策略创建了三个不同计算预算的模型。

Result: 最准确的模型达到了最先进的精度，同时比同类模型快1.2倍且内存占用降低6倍；最快的模型能够在仅使用500MB GPU内存的情况下以20FPS处理全高清帧。

Conclusion: 通过移除成本体积的训练策略，可以在保持高精度的同时显著提升光流估计的效率和资源利用率。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

Motivation: 现有隐蔽武器检测方法存在分辨率低、隐私问题等限制，需要开发实时、低成本、保护隐私的解决方案，而热成像在这方面具有优势但缺乏基准数据集。

Method: 在YOLOv8基础上改进：在SPPF层使用可变形卷积提取多尺度特征；在骨干网络和颈部网络提取低中高层特征；引入焦点损失解决类别不平衡问题；创建TICW数据集。

Result: DEF-YOLO能够在热成像同质区域自适应聚焦目标定位，同时保持速度和吞吐量，为热成像隐蔽武器检测建立了新的基准。

Conclusion: 该方法为隐蔽武器检测提供了有效的热成像解决方案，通过架构改进和数据集创建解决了该领域的关键挑战。

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAE在自监督学习中存在码本崩溃问题，现有方法使用隐式静态码本或联合优化整个码本，限制了码本的学习能力并降低了重建质量。

Method: Group-VQ进行分组优化码本，每组独立优化，组内联合优化，同时提出无需训练的码本重采样方法。

Result: 在各种图像重建实验中，Group-VQ在重建指标上表现更好，训练后码本采样方法实现了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Conclusion: Group-VQ改善了码本利用率和重建性能之间的权衡，训练后码本采样方法提供了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无参考视频质量评估方法和数据集主要针对摄像机拍摄视频，直接应用于渲染视频会产生偏差预测，因为渲染视频更容易出现时间伪影。

Method: 创建大型渲染导向视频数据集，包含多种3D场景和渲染设置，并设计专门针对渲染视频的NR-VQA指标，同时考虑图像质量和时间稳定性。

Result: 提出的NR-VQA指标在渲染视频上表现优于现有方法，能够有效评估超采样方法和实时渲染中的帧生成策略。

Conclusion: 该工作为渲染视频质量评估提供了专门的数据集和指标，填补了现有方法的空白，在计算机图形应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，在视觉语言模型的零样本分类中，对于高性能模型（如MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP），最简单的基础提示词效果最好，增加描述性细节反而会显著降低性能，这种现象被称为"提示词过拟合"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型能够在数据稀缺条件下进行零样本分类，但提示词设计对识别视觉相似类别（如人体姿势）的影响尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 使用285张COCO数据集图像，评估包括OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2和SigLip在内的现代视觉语言模型，采用三层次提示词设计系统性地增加语言细节。

Result: 高性能模型（MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP）使用最简单提示词时表现最佳（MetaCLIP 2多类准确率达68.8%），增加描述细节后性能显著下降（降至55.1%）。而性能较低的SigLip模型在给予更多基于身体线索的描述性提示词时，对模糊类别的分类有所改善。

Conclusion: 提示词设计对视觉语言模型的零样本分类性能有显著影响，高性能模型倾向于简单提示词，而低性能模型可能从更详细的提示词中受益，揭示了"提示词过拟合"现象。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在需要精确空间推理的任务上表现不佳，因为它们从视觉-语言模型继承的空间推理能力有限，且依赖大量动作数据预训练来在3D空间中定位，这降低了训练效率且仍不足以实现准确的空间理解。

Method: DepthVLA采用混合变换器设计，统一了视觉-语言模型、深度变换器和动作专家，通过完全共享注意力形成端到端模型，明确通过预训练的深度预测模块融入空间感知。

Result: 在真实世界任务中达到78.5%进展（vs. 65.0%），在LIBERO模拟器中达到94.9%（vs. 93.6%），在Simpler模拟器中达到74.8%（vs. 58.8%），均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DepthVLA通过显式融入空间感知，有效提升了VLA模型的空间推理能力，在多种环境中都表现出优越性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于3DGS的动态城市场景方法需要相机和LiDAR数据、真实3D分割和运动数据，限制了应用范围。

Method: 集成SDF与3DGS，利用深度和点跟踪的2D对象无关先验，构建统一的优化框架。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合SDF和3DGS的优势，实现了更鲁棒的对象表示，放宽了对数据要求的限制。

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene

*Feng-Qi Cui,Yu-Tong Guo,Tianyue Zheng,Jinyang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GLSDA框架，利用预训练大模型的语义先验增强WiFi手势识别的泛化能力和语义表达能力，通过双路径CSI编码、多尺度语义编码器和鲁棒双蒸馏策略，在跨域手势识别任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WiFi手势识别方法存在泛化能力有限和语义表达能力不足的问题，主要由于信道状态信息的域敏感性以及缺乏高级手势抽象。

Method: 设计双路径CSI编码管道捕获几何和动态手势模式，使用多尺度语义编码器学习鲁棒时序嵌入并通过跨模态注意力对齐语义，引入语义感知软监督方案编码类间相关性，开发鲁棒双蒸馏策略压缩模型。

Result: 在Widar3.0基准测试中，GLSDA在域内和跨域手势识别任务中均优于最先进方法，同时显著减小模型大小和推理延迟。

Conclusion: GLSDA为现实世界AIoT应用中的通用RF手势接口提供了可扩展和可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的基准Spatial-DISE，基于认知分类法评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，特别关注内在动态推理，并开发了自动化流水线生成数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估空间推理能力，特别是内在动态空间推理方面不足，而这对机器人、增强现实和自主导航等应用至关重要。

Method: 基于认知分类法将任务分为四个象限，开发了可扩展的自动化流水线生成多样且可验证的空间推理问题，创建了包含评估和训练数据的数据集。

Result: 对28个最先进VLM的评估显示，当前模型与人类能力存在显著差距，特别是在多步骤多视图空间推理方面。

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE为未来研究提供了稳健框架、有价值的数据集和明确方向，推动实现类人空间智能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

TL;DR: 提出了Mask-GRPO方法，首次将基于GRPO的强化学习应用于被忽视的掩码生成模型，通过重新定义转移概率将解掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，显著提升了文本到图像生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要针对扩散模型或自回归模型，而忽略了掩码生成模型这一重要替代方案，需要开发专门针对该范式的强化学习方法。

Method: 提出Mask-GRPO方法，重新定义转移概率，将解掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，并采用去除KL约束、应用缩减策略和过滤低质量样本等增强策略。

Result: 在标准文本到图像基准测试和偏好对齐方面显著提升了基础模型Show-o的性能，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO成功将强化学习应用于掩码生成模型，为该范式提供了有效的训练方法，在文本到图像生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

*Jianhui Zhang,Sheng Cheng,Qirui Sun,Jia Liu,Wang Luyang,Chaoyu Feng,Chen Fang,Lei Lei,Jue Wang,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter是一个用于高分辨率文本引导图像修复的有效框架，能够实现4K+分辨率，同时保持内容一致性和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于较低分辨率，在高分辨率和纹理复杂度增加时，内容一致性和提示对齐这两个关键挑战会加剧。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器架构：双上下文适配器学习掩码和非掩码区域的连贯性以建立全局结构一致性；参考补丁适配器实现补丁级注意力机制进行全分辨率修复，通过自适应特征融合保持局部细节保真度。

Result: 实验表明Patch-Adapter不仅解决了大规模修复中的常见伪影，还在OpenImages和Photo-Concept-Bucket数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在感知质量和文本提示遵循方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Patch-Adapter通过解耦全局语义和局部细化，独特地解决了高分辨率修复中的可扩展性差距问题。

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

### [57] [CoDS: Enhancing Collaborative Perception in Heterogeneous Scenarios via Domain Separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13432)
*Yushan Han,Hui Zhang,Honglei Zhang,Chuntao Ding,Yuanzhouhan Cao,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDS是一种用于异构场景下协作感知的方法，通过域分离解决特征差异问题，采用轻量级空间通道调整器和分布对齐模块，在保持高推理效率的同时提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法假设所有智能体使用相同编码器，但在实际异构场景中不成立。现有方法将邻居特征对齐到自车特征，容易受域间隙噪声影响，且基于transformer的域适应模块在移动设备上推理效率低。

Method: 提出CoDS方法，包含轻量级空间通道调整器(LSCR)和基于域分离的分布对齐(DADS)两个特征对齐模块，使用域对齐互信息(DAMI)损失确保有效特征对齐。LSCR通过轻量卷积层对齐空间和通道维度特征，DADS通过编码器特定和编码器无关的域分离模块减少特征分布差异。

Result: 大量实验表明，CoDS能有效缓解异构场景中的特征差异问题，在检测精度和推理效率之间实现了良好平衡。

Conclusion: CoDS通过域分离方法成功解决了异构协作感知中的特征差异问题，其全卷积架构确保了高推理效率，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要在2D像素层面操作，难以分离神经元对物理场景属性的选择性。需要一种能够直接在3D空间中表征神经元选择性的方法。

Method: 使用可微分渲染管道优化可变形网格，通过径向基函数参数化网格变形，学习最大化神经元响应的偏移和尺度，同时保持几何规律性。

Result: 应用于猴子V4区域模型时，该方法能够探索神经元对可解释3D因素（如姿态和光照）的选择性。

Conclusion: 该方法将逆向图形学与系统神经科学相结合，提供了一种超越传统像素方法的、基于物理基础的3D刺激来探测神经选择性的途径。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中的应用，比较了CNN和PLS模型，发现CNN在空间-光谱联合分析中表现更好，而PLS在化学参数平均含量分析中效果相当且推荐使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中的潜力，特别是比较深度学习方法和传统方法在食品质量参数建模中的性能差异。

Method: 通过四个研究，使用卷积神经网络（CNN）和偏最小二乘法（PLS）进行建模，包括空间-光谱联合分析、光谱卷积增强的2D CNN等方法。

Result: CNN在空间-光谱联合分析中优于PLS；添加光谱卷积层的2D CNN能改善化学参数预测；PLS在化学参数平均含量分析中表现良好；CNN能生成更合理的化学分布图。

Conclusion: 近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中具有潜力，CNN在复杂参数建模中表现优异，而PLS在简单分析中仍是推荐方法，同时开发了两个开源Python工具包。

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Conclusion: VIST3A框架成功整合了文本到视频生成和3D重建技术，为文本到3D生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练或架构修改，可实时部署于机器人应用，在各种环境条件下提高了精确率-召回率性能。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

Conclusion: 模型具有高度适应性，可用于开发实际环境中的端到端情绪识别系统，代码和结果已公开

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

Conclusion: 动作单元是有效的非瞬态特征，能够支持高效的增量学习，在复杂情感识别任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at
https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.

### [66] [Accelerated Feature Detectors for Visual SLAM: A Comparative Study of FPGA vs GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13546)
*Ruiqi Ye,Mikel Luján*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文比较了GPU和FPGA在视觉SLAM中特征检测模块的加速效果，发现对于传统特征检测器（FAST、Harris），GPU实现更优；而对于学习型检测器（SuperPoint），FPGA在性能和能效上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征检测是SLAM系统中的耗时模块，而无人机等功耗受限平台需要高效的硬件加速方案。GPU和集成FPGA的SoC都是常见的加速选择，但缺乏系统性的比较研究。

Method: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin和AMD Versal等现代SoC上，比较GPU和FPGA加速的FAST、Harris和SuperPoint特征检测器在视觉SLAM流水线中的表现。

Result: 对于非学习型检测器，GPU实现比FPGA在运行性能和能效上更优；对于学习型检测器SuperPoint，FPGA实现可获得3.1倍性能提升和1.4倍能效提升。FPGA加速的V-SLAM在部分数据集上帧率更高，但GPU版本精度总体更好。

Conclusion: 硬件加速特征检测可减少全局束调整调用频率而不损失精度。选择GPU还是FPGA加速取决于特征检测器类型：传统检测器选GPU，学习型检测器选FPGA。

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: 该研究通过基于代理的流式基准测试，揭示了跨文化组成和渐进模糊如何影响面部表情识别的鲁棒性。研究发现不同文化群体在模糊条件下的性能退化曲线存在不对称性，混合群体表现出中间模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部表情识别评估通常假设同质数据和高质量图像，但实际应用中需要应对文化差异和视觉条件退化。研究旨在量化文化组成和交互结构如何影响FER在感知条件恶化时的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用基于代理的流式基准测试，每个代理在冻结的CLIP特征空间中运行，使用轻量级残差适配器在线训练。代理在5x5网格上移动交互，环境提供sigma调度的Gaussian模糊输入。研究了单文化群体、平衡/不平衡混合群体以及不同空间接触结构。

Result: JAFFE（亚洲）群体在低模糊时保持较高性能但在中间阶段急剧下降，KDEF（西方）群体退化更均匀。混合群体呈现中间模式，平衡混合缓解早期退化，但不平衡设置在高模糊下放大主流群体弱点。

Conclusion: 研究量化了文化组成和交互结构对FER鲁棒性的影响，揭示了在感知条件恶化时不同文化群体的不对称退化模式，为跨文化FER系统的鲁棒性设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

Motivation: 深度估计对自动驾驶至关重要，雷达-相机融合在恶劣条件下通过提供互补的几何线索提供鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两种知识蒸馏策略：可解释性对齐蒸馏（将教师的显著性结构转移到学生）和深度分布蒸馏（将深度回归重新表述为离散化区间的软分类）。

Result: 与直接训练相比，MAE降低7.97%，在nuScenes和ZJU-4DRadarCam数据集上实现具有实时效率的竞争性精度。

Conclusion: XD-RCDepth在显著减少参数的同时保持了深度估计性能，通过知识蒸馏策略增强了模型的可解释性和压缩后的性能保持能力。

Abstract: Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera
fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary
geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight
architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the
state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To
preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

Motivation: 现有数据集难以完全捕捉真实世界的复杂性，特别是在有限的成像条件下。需要覆盖不同高度、角度、全天候和全年时间变化的多样化数据集。

Method: 提出PCDF方法，通过将成像条件编码为文本提示，利用任务特定的软门控变换自适应重新分配多模态贡献。还包括提示引导的条件解耦模块，确保在没有条件标注时的实用性。

Result: 在ATR-UMOD数据集上的实验验证了PCDF方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ATR-UMOD数据集和PCDF方法为解决多样化条件下的无人机多模态目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

TL;DR: 提出了AVAR-Net，一个轻量级的音频-视觉异常识别框架，通过融合音频和视觉特征，在真实环境中实现高效的异常识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖视觉数据，在遮挡、低光照和恶劣天气等挑战条件下不可靠，且缺乏大规模同步音频-视觉数据集阻碍了多模态异常识别的发展。

Method: AVAR-Net包含四个模块：音频特征提取器（Wav2Vec2）、视频特征提取器（MobileViT）、融合策略和序列模式学习网络（MTCN），通过早期融合机制和多阶段时序卷积网络建模跨模态关系。

Result: 在VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率，在XD-Violence数据集上达到88.56%平均精度，比现有最先进方法提升2.8%平均精度。

Conclusion: AVAR-Net框架具有高效性、有效性和泛化能力，同时提出的VAAR数据集可作为多模态异常识别研究的基准。

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像常受噪声、伪影和低对比度等问题影响，限制了其诊断潜力。需要强大的预处理、去噪算法和先进的增强方法来提高医学图像质量和可解释性，支持早期检测、准确诊断和有效治疗规划。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法的系统文献综述，分析了39项同行评审研究，调查医学图像增强的关键挑战、最新进展和评估指标。

Result: 发现低对比度和噪声是最频繁的问题，MRI和多模态成像受到最多关注，而组织病理学、内窥镜和骨闪烁扫描等专业模态研究不足。在图像质量评估方面，共引入了65个IQA指标，主要是非参考型指标。

Conclusion: 该综述突出了当前医学图像增强的局限性、研究空白和未来潜在发展方向，强调了评估指标在评估增强方法影响方面的重要性。

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DINOv2的异常检测器在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性和不确定性校准能力未被充分研究，限制了其在安全关键场景的应用。

Method: 在AnomalyDINO基础上，通过附加轻量级线性头进行白盒梯度攻击，并使用Platt缩放对异常分数进行后处理校准。

Result: 发现微小扰动可改变特征空间中的最近邻关系导致误分类，原始异常分数校准性差，校准后方法能有效检测攻击并降低校准误差。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性和不确定性量化是异常检测系统可信部署的必要能力，本研究为稳健的异常检测建立了评估协议和基线。

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够有效解决现有扩散模型在超分辨率任务中的局限性，生成结构一致且感知保真的高质量图像。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Conclusion: EditCast3D为将基础模型集成到3D编辑管道提供了一个可扩展的通用范式，有效减少对昂贵图像编辑的依赖并缓解提示歧义问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视线估计方法在跨数据领域泛化方面存在困难，主要因为标注数据集稀缺和标注数据多样性不足。

Method: 构建多样化的无标注面部图像集合，采用伪标注策略并设计奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，结合视觉嵌入和语义线索计算置信度分数。

Conclusion: OmniGaze不仅是一个有效的视线估计方法，还可作为可扩展的数据引擎，在多样化真实世界环境中实现稳健的3D视线估计。

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

Conclusion: CanvasMAR通过画布机制有效解决了视频掩码自回归模型的关键限制，实现了更高效和高质量的视频生成。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了KnowCoL框架，通过结合图像、文本描述和Wikidata结构化知识，在共享语义空间中实现开放域视觉实体识别，显著提升了罕见和未见实体的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域视觉实体识别面临固定标签集、训练期间未见实体、长尾分布等挑战，需要解决有限监督、视觉模糊性和语义消歧问题。

Method: 使用知识引导的对比学习框架，将视觉和文本输入抽象到概念层面，利用实体描述、类型层次结构和关系上下文来支持零样本实体识别。

Result: 在OVEN基准测试中，最小模型相比最先进方法在未见实体上的准确率提升了10.5%，同时模型大小减少了35倍。

Conclusion: 结合视觉、文本和结构化知识能显著提升开放域视觉实体识别性能，特别是在处理罕见和未见实体时效果明显。

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

*Xinyang Li,Tengfei Wang,Zixiao Gu,Shengchuan Zhang,Chunchao Guo,Liujuan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashWorld是一个快速生成3D场景的生成模型，从单张图像或文本提示在秒级时间内生成3D场景，比之前工作快10-100倍，同时具有更优的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视图导向方法生成多视图图像再进行3D重建，而3D导向方法直接生成3D表示但视觉质量较差。FlashWorld旨在结合两种范式的优势，实现快速且高质量的3D场景生成。

Method: 采用双模式预训练和跨模式后训练：首先预训练支持多视图导向和3D导向的双模式多视图扩散模型；然后通过跨模式后训练蒸馏，将3D导向模式的质量提升到多视图导向模式水平，同时减少推理所需的去噪步骤。

Result: 实验证明该方法在速度和渲染质量上均优于现有方法，能够快速生成高质量的3D场景。

Conclusion: FlashWorld通过创新的双模式训练框架，成功实现了快速、高质量的3D场景生成，为3D内容创作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

### [80] [Generating healthy counterfactuals with denoising diffusion bridge models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13684)
*Ana Lawry Aguila,Peirong Liu,Marina Crespo Aguirre,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于去噪扩散桥模型(DDBM)的方法，用于从病理图像生成健康的反事实图像，该方法在扩散过程中同时考虑健康图像和对应的合成病理图像作为结构先验，能够更好地平衡病理去除与个体解剖特征的保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成健康反事实图像在医学成像中具有重要应用价值，如异常检测和健康扫描分析工具的应用。现有方法难以有效平衡异常去除与个体特征保留的挑战。

Method: 使用去噪扩散桥模型(DDBM)，与传统的DDPM不同，DDBM在扩散过程中不仅以健康图像为初始点，还以对应的合成病理图像为最终点，将病理图像作为结构先验信息。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的DDBM方法在分割和异常检测任务上优于先前提出的扩散模型和全监督方法。

Conclusion: DDBM方法能够生成与患者解剖结构密切匹配的健康反事实图像，同时选择性去除病理，在医学图像分析任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS)方法，通过重新表述查询来增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，实现查询级别的风险评估，并自适应引导激活以生成安全且有用的响应，无需迭代输出调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态查询中嵌入恶意意图的安全对齐问题，避免传统方法中过度拒绝良性查询和推理速度慢的缺点。

Method: 重新表述查询以增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，进行查询级别的风险评估，并根据评估风险自适应引导模型激活生成响应。

Result: 在多个多模态安全和效用基准测试中，RAS显著降低了攻击成功率，保持了通用任务性能，并提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: RAS是一种有效的推理时安全对齐方法，能够在保证安全性的同时维持模型效用和推理效率。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MVCustom框架，解决多视角生成与个性化定制难以统一的问题，通过特征场表示和深度感知特征渲染等技术，同时实现相机姿态控制和几何一致性的个性化生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个问题：多视角生成模型不支持几何一致的个性化定制，而个性化定制模型缺乏明确的视角控制。为了解决这一统一难题，提出了多视角定制这一新任务。

Method: 提出MVCustom扩散框架，训练阶段使用特征场表示学习主体身份和几何信息，结合增强的文本到视频扩散骨干网络；推理阶段引入深度感知特征渲染和一致性感知潜在补全技术。

Result: 大量实验证明MVCustom是唯一能同时实现忠实多视角生成和个性化定制的框架。

Conclusion: MVCustom成功解决了多视角生成与个性化定制的统一问题，通过创新的技术实现了几何一致性和视角控制的同时优化。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于U-Net骨架化和A*图连接的方法，从脑部血管图像中提取Willis环中心线图，实现了高精度的拓扑重建和稳健的形态特征提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Willis环是脑部重要动脉网络，传统骨架化方法难以可靠提取其复杂几何结构的中心线，且公开的中心线数据集稀缺，需要开发更可靠的自动分析方法。

Method: 结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接算法，从TopCoW数据集的MRA和CTA图像中提取中心线图和形态特征，包括半径、长度和分叉比等参数。

Result: 算法在测试集上实现了完美的拓扑重建精度（F1=1），节点平均欧氏距离小于一个体素，特征提取的误差中位数低于5%，皮尔逊相关系数高于0.95。

Conclusion: 基于学习的骨架化结合图连接方法能够提取解剖学上合理的中心线，强调了超越简单体素测量、评估解剖准确性和特征稳健性的重要性。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

TL;DR: 提出LiFMCR数据集，用于多微透镜阵列光场相机配准，包含两个高分辨率Raytrix R32相机同步图像序列和Vicon运动捕捉系统的高精度6自由度位姿，为多相机光场配准方法提供严格评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光场数据集局限于单相机设置且缺乏外部真实值，需要多相机光场配准的严格评估基准。

Method: 提供两种互补配准方法：基于RANSAC的跨视图点云3D变换估计，以及从单光场图像估计6自由度外参的plenoptic PnP算法，两者都明确集成了光场相机模型。

Result: 实验显示与真实值强对齐，支持可靠的多视角光场处理。

Conclusion: LiFMCR数据集和配准方法为多相机光场配准提供了准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种循环自监督扩散框架（CSS-Diff），用于从真实低场MRI数据合成高场MRI图像，通过循环一致性约束和两个新网络模块来提升解剖结构保真度和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI虽然更便宜、更易获取且更安全，但存在分辨率低和信噪比差的问题。合成高场MRI可以减少对昂贵采集的依赖，但现有方法存在临床保真度差距，需要保持解剖保真度、增强细粒度结构细节并弥合图像对比度差异。

Method: 提出了循环自监督扩散框架（CSS-Diff），核心思想是在循环一致性约束下重新制定基于扩散的合成方法。包含两个新过程：切片间间隙感知网络通过对比学习对齐切片间不一致性；局部结构校正网络通过掩码和扰动补丁的自重建来增强局部特征恢复。

Result: 在跨场合成任务中取得了最先进的性能（PSNR: 31.80±2.70 dB，SSIM: 0.943±0.102，LPIPS: 0.0864±0.0689）。相比原始低场MRI，细粒度解剖结构得到更好保留（左脑白质误差从12.1%降至2.1%，皮层从4.2%降至3.7%）。

Conclusion: CSS-Diff能够合成在数量上可靠且在解剖学上一致的图像，既保持了像素级保真度，又保留了细粒度解剖结构。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图构建方法LSGC和混合CNN-GNN模型LogViG，通过限制长距离连接数量来提升视觉图神经网络性能，在图像分类和语义分割任务上超越了现有ViG、CNN和ViT架构。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的图构建方法如KNN在较大图像上计算成本高，而SVGA等方法由于固定步长尺度会导致过度压缩和错过长距离连接的信息增益。

Method: 提出对数可扩展图构建方法LSGC，开发了LogViG混合CNN-GNN模型，引入高分辨率分支并在高分辨率和低分辨率分支之间融合特征，构建多尺度高分辨率视觉GNN网络。

Result: LogViG在准确率、GMACs和参数量方面均优于现有ViG、CNN和ViT架构。最小模型Ti-LogViG在ImageNet-1K上达到79.9%平均top-1准确率，比Vision GNN高1.7%，同时参数量减少24.3%，GMACs减少35.3%。

Conclusion: 通过LSGC在ViG图构建中利用长距离连接可以超越当前最先进的ViG性能。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex

speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source

TL;DR: RECODE是一个代理框架，通过将视觉反渲染为可执行代码来实现可验证的视觉推理，在多个基准测试中显著优于不利用代码的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理结构化视觉内容（如图表、图表）时缺乏验证机制，像素级感知难以进行精确推理。

Method: 提出RECODE框架：首先生成多个候选程序来重现输入图像，然后使用批评器选择最忠实的重建，并迭代优化代码。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知基于可执行代码为实现更准确和可验证的多模态推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

### [90] [Uni-MMMU: A Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Unified Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13759)
*Kai Zou,Ziqi Huang,Yuhao Dong,Shulin Tian,Dian Zheng,Hongbo Liu,Jingwen He,Bin Liu,Yu Qiao,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-MMMU是一个多模态基准测试，系统性地评估视觉理解和生成能力的双向协同作用，覆盖科学、编程、数学等八个推理领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试很少真正检验视觉理解和生成能力的整合，要么孤立评估这两种能力，要么忽视它们内在耦合的任务。

Method: 设计包含可验证中间推理步骤、独特真实值和可重复评分协议的基准测试，每个任务都双向耦合，要求模型利用概念理解指导视觉合成，或利用生成作为分析推理的认知支架。

Result: 通过对最先进统一模型、仅生成模型和仅理解模型的广泛评估，揭示了显著的性能差距和跨模态依赖关系。

Conclusion: 该基准为推进统一模型提供了可靠基础，揭示了这些能力何时以及如何相互增强的新见解。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

TL;DR: 将4D fMRI数据转换为2D活动平铺图视频，使用视觉Transformer和时空掩码自编码器训练，发现性能随数据量增加遵循幂律缩放规律，在下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合fMRI与自然图像之间的模态差距，为fMRI数据构建基础模型。

Method: 将4D fMRI数据转换为2D活动平铺图视频，使用视觉Transformer和时空掩码自编码器(MAE)在Human Connectome Project的2.3K小时数据上进行训练。

Result: 掩码fMRI建模性能随数据集大小按严格幂律缩放规律提升，在下游分类任务中学习到丰富表征，支持跨被试的细粒度状态解码和跨脑状态变化的被试特异性特征解码。

Conclusion: 该方法成功构建了fMRI基础模型，证明了大规模预训练在fMRI分析中的有效性，是开放科学项目的一部分。

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

### [92] [Adaptive Visual Conditioning for Semantic Consistency in Diffusion-Based Story Continuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13787)
*Seyed Mohammad Mousavi,Morteza Analoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AVC框架，用于基于扩散模型的故事延续，通过自适应视觉条件机制有效利用先前视觉上下文，并在没有相关图像时限制其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 故事延续需要生成与文本描述和先前图像保持连贯的下一张图像，关键在于有效利用视觉上下文同时确保与当前文本输入的语义对齐。

Method: 使用CLIP模型检索语义最相关的先前图像，当没有足够相关图像时，自适应地限制先前视觉信息在扩散过程早期阶段的影响；通过大语言模型重新标注噪声数据集来提升数据质量。

Result: 定量结果和人工评估显示，AVC在连贯性、语义一致性和视觉保真度方面优于强基线方法，特别是在先前视觉与当前输入冲突的挑战性场景中表现更佳。

Conclusion: AVC框架通过自适应视觉条件机制，能够在有益时利用视觉上下文，同时避免引入误导性或不相关信息，实现了更好的故事延续效果。

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

*Nir Goren,Oren Katzir,Abhinav Nakarmi,Eyal Ronen,Mahmood Sharif,Or Patashnik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisePrints是一种轻量级水印方案，利用扩散过程初始化随机种子作为作者证明，无需修改生成过程或访问模型权重


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在视觉内容生成中的快速应用，证明作者身份和保护版权变得至关重要，特别是当模型所有者保持模型私有时，需要第三方验证方案

Method: 通过将哈希函数集成到噪声采样过程中，利用初始噪声与生成视觉内容的高度相关性，使用随机种子作为水印，并通过零知识证明保护种子隐私

Result: 实验证明该方法在多种最先进的图像和视频扩散模型中有效，仅需种子和输出即可进行高效验证，无需模型权重

Conclusion: NoisePrints提供了一种实用且可扩展的版权保护方案，解决了现有方法需要模型权重和计算量大的问题

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

TL;DR: 提出了Honey-Data-15M数据集和HoneyPipe数据清洗管道，训练出的Bee-8B模型在完全开源多模态大语言模型中达到新SOTA，性能可与半开源模型竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前完全开源多模态大语言模型落后于专有模型，主要原因是监督微调数据质量存在显著差距，现有开源数据集普遍存在噪声且缺乏复杂推理数据。

Method: 1. 构建Honey-Data-15M数据集（约1500万问答对），采用多重清洗技术和双级CoT增强策略；2. 开发HoneyPipe数据整理管道和DataStudio框架；3. 训练8B参数的Bee-8B模型。

Result: Bee-8B在完全开源MLLMs中建立新SOTA，性能与InternVL3.5-8B等半开源模型相当甚至超越，验证了数据质量对模型性能的关键作用。

Conclusion: 通过专注于数据质量的系统方法，可以开发出与半开源模型高度竞争的完全开源多模态大语言模型，为社区提供完整的基础资源套件。

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GS-Reasoner，这是首个无需外部模块就能实现自回归3D视觉定位的3D LLM，通过双路径池化机制构建统一的图像块3D表示，显著提升了空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D LLM缺乏能够同时捕捉语义和几何信息的统一3D表示，导致定位性能差或过度依赖外部模块，阻碍了定位与空间推理的无缝集成。

Method: 提出双路径池化机制，将几何特征与语义和位置线索紧密对齐，构建基于图像块的统一3D表示；引入GCoT数据集，包含3D边界框标注和集成定位的逐步推理路径。

Result: GS-Reasoner在3D视觉定位上取得显著成果，同时显著增强了空间推理能力，达到最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner建立了统一且自包含的3D空间推理框架，证明了3D视觉定位是空间推理的基石，通过紧密集成定位与推理实现了性能突破。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出轨迹场表示法，将视频表示为每个像素的连续3D轨迹，并开发Trace Anything模型通过单次前向传播预测整个轨迹场，在轨迹估计和点跟踪任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中的像素在时间维度上形成连续3D轨迹，这是理解视频动态的基本单元。基于此原理，需要一种能够有效表示和预测像素轨迹的方法。

Method: 提出轨迹场表示法，将视频映射为每个像素的连续3D轨迹函数。开发Trace Anything神经网络，通过单次前向传播为每个像素预测一组控制点来参数化B样条轨迹。

Result: 在大规模4D数据上训练，在轨迹场估计新基准上达到最先进性能，在点跟踪基准上表现竞争力；具有显著效率优势；展现出目标条件操作、运动预测和时空融合等涌现能力。

Conclusion: 轨迹场表示法为视频动态建模提供了有效框架，Trace Anything模型通过单次前向传播实现了高效准确的轨迹预测，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在多模态推理中缺乏可靠的视觉结果验证能力，与人类水平的可靠视觉验证存在显著差距。

Method: 构建ViVerBench基准测试，设计自动化流水线构建大规模视觉验证数据，训练OmniVerifier-7B通用验证器，提出OmniVerifier-TTS序列测试时扩展范式。

Result: OmniVerifier-7B在ViVerBench上提升8.3分，OmniVerifier-TTS在T2I-ReasonBench和GenEval++上分别提升3.7和4.3分，优于现有并行测试时扩展方法。

Conclusion: 通过赋予多模态推理可靠的视觉验证能力，OmniVerifier推动了生成过程中的可靠反思和可扩展测试时优化，向更可信和可控的新一代推理系统迈进。

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

TL;DR: VisCoP通过向视觉编码器添加可学习的视觉探针来实现大视觉语言模型的高效领域自适应，在跨视角、跨模态和跨任务等挑战性场景中表现优异，同时保留源域知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大视觉语言模型在遇到与预训练数据分布差异较大的新领域时性能急剧下降，而现有的领域自适应方法要么学习有限的领域特定特征，要么导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出Vision Contextualized Probing (VisCoP)，在视觉编码器中添加一组紧凑的可学习视觉探针，实现高效领域自适应，同时最小化对预训练参数的修改。

Result: 在跨视角（外中心到自我中心）、跨模态（RGB到深度）和跨任务（人类理解到机器人控制）三个挑战性领域自适应设置中，VisCoP始终优于现有自适应策略。

Conclusion: VisCoP能够在目标领域实现卓越性能，同时有效保留源域知识，为视觉语言模型的领域自适应提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型虽然能生成视觉上真实的视频，但往往违反物理定律，限制了其作为'世界模型'的能力

Method: 基于图像到视频任务，设计PhysEncoder从输入图像中提取物理信息作为额外条件，并应用基于人类反馈的强化学习来优化物理表征

Result: PhysMaster能够提升视频生成的物理意识，在简单代理任务上证明其有效性，并具有广泛的物理场景泛化能力

Conclusion: PhysMaster通过强化学习范式中的表征学习为各种物理过程提供统一解决方案，可作为物理感知视频生成的通用插件解决方案

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.
