### [1] [LoRA-Edge: Tensor-Train-Assisted LoRA for Practical CNN Fine-Tuning on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03765)
*Hyunseok Kwak,Kyeongwon Lee,Jae-Jin Lee,Woojoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-Edge是一种参数高效微调方法，结合低秩适应和张量训练分解，用于边缘设备上CNN的轻量级微调，大幅减少可训练参数同时保持接近全微调的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上CNN的完整微调在严格的内存、计算和能耗预算下不可行，需要参数高效的微调方法来应对领域偏移问题。

Method: 对预训练卷积层应用张量训练奇异值分解，仅选择性更新输出侧核心并采用零初始化，最后将更新融合回密集核中，保持推理成本不变。

Result: 在多种HAR数据集和CNN骨干网络上，LoRA-Edge仅更新最多1.49%的参数即可达到与全微调相差4.7%以内的精度，在Jetson Orin Nano上收敛速度提升1.4-3.8倍。

Conclusion: LoRA-Edge使得结构对齐、参数高效的设备端CNN适配在边缘平台上变得实用可行。

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

### [2] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI是一个开源标注软件，用于在视频数据中标注行为和交互，生成适合训练计算机视觉模型的结构化输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源标注工具要么支持行为标注但不定位个体，要么支持定位但不捕获交互，无法满足分析动物社交行为的需求。

Method: 开发SILVI软件，集成行为标注和交互标注功能，直接在视频数据中标注，生成结构化输出。

Result: SILVI能够标注行为和交互，为训练和验证计算机视觉模型提供结构化数据，促进精细行为分析自动化方法的发展。

Conclusion: SILVI填补了现有工具的空白，连接行为生态学和计算机视觉，虽然主要针对动物行为开发，但也可用于标注人类交互和其他需要提取动态场景图的视频。

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [3] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在训练过程中使用基本噪声注入技术（高斯、斑点、泊松和椒盐噪声）来提高COVID-19胸部X光图像识别模型对分布外数据的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在图像识别中容易学习源特定的伪影（捷径）而非合理的生物标志物，导致无法泛化到来自不同设备、人群等的分布外数据，特别是在COVID-19胸部X光检测中。

Method: 在训练过程中应用四种基本噪声注入技术：高斯噪声、斑点噪声、泊松噪声和椒盐噪声，以增强模型对分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Result: 噪声注入技术显著减少了分布内和分布外评估之间的性能差距，从0.10-0.20降低到0.01-0.06，基于AUC、F1、准确率、召回率和特异性等关键指标在十个随机种子上的平均结果。

Conclusion: 基本噪声注入技术是提高COVID-19胸部X光检测模型对分布外数据泛化能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

### [4] [Investigating Robot Control Policy Learning for Autonomous X-ray-guided Spine Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03882)
*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了基于模仿学习的机器人控制策略在X射线引导的脊柱手术中的应用，开发了用于模拟脊柱手术的沙盒环境，并训练了仅基于视觉信息的插管对齐策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索模仿学习在X射线引导的脊柱手术（如脊柱器械植入）中的适用性，因为多视图X射线的解释很复杂，需要解决这一挑战。

Method: 方法包括开发高真实度的脊柱手术模拟沙盒，收集正确轨迹和双平面X射线序列数据集，训练基于视觉信息的模仿学习策略进行规划和开环控制。

Result: 策略在68.5%的情况下首次尝试成功，能保持安全的椎弓根内轨迹，并泛化到复杂解剖结构（包括骨折），对不同的初始化保持鲁棒性。在真实X射线上的测试也显示出生成合理轨迹的能力。

Conclusion: 虽然初步结果有前景，但存在入点精度等限制。完全闭环控制需要更频繁的反馈机制，结合更鲁棒的先验知识和领域知识，这类模型可能为未来轻量级、无CT的机器人术中脊柱导航提供基础。

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [5] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量化YOLOv12的实时垃圾检测框架，结合自对抗训练和专门数据增强策略，在沙漠环境中实现高精度、低延迟的垃圾检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球垃圾危机日益严重，传统垃圾收集方法在偏远或恶劣环境（如沙漠）中效率低下且危险。现有计算机视觉研究主要关注城市环境和可回收材料，忽视了有机和危险垃圾以及沙漠等未充分探索的地形。

Method: 使用剪枝后的轻量化YOLOv12模型，集成自对抗训练和专门的数据增强策略，在DroneTrashNet数据集上进行训练。

Result: 在精度、召回率和平均精度方面取得显著提升，同时实现低延迟和小模型尺寸，适合在资源受限的无人机上部署。与最先进的轻量化YOLO变体相比，在准确性和效率之间达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 结合数据中心和模型中心增强方法，在沙漠环境中实现了稳健的实时垃圾检测，验证了该框架的有效性。

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [6] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出基于类别的图像合成方法，通过将同一类别的多张图像融合成复合图像来增强训练样本的信息密度和类内方差，在小样本和不平衡数据集上显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小样本、不平衡数据集和低质量输入图像导致深度学习模型假阳性率高的问题，通过增强训练样本的信息含量来改善模型对细微疾病模式的识别能力。

Method: 提出基于类别的图像合成方法，将同一类别的多张图像融合成3x1布局的复合图像，构建平衡数据集Co-OCTDL，使用VGG16模型在原始数据集和合成数据集上进行对比实验。

Result: 在OCT视网膜扫描数据集上，合成数据集相比原始数据集实现了近乎完美的准确率(99.6%)、F1分数(0.995)和AUC(0.9996)，假阳性率显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理类别不平衡和小样本问题，即使对于质量较差的数据集也能产生高质量的预测结果。

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [7] [I Detect What I Don't Know: Incremental Anomaly Learning with Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian for Oracle-Free Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03912)
*Nand Kumar Yadav,Rodrigue Rizk,William CW Chen,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督、无需专家标注的医学影像异常检测框架，通过增量扩展可信正常样本集，结合轻量适配器更新和不确定性门控样本准入机制，在多个医学影像数据集上显著提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中的未知异常检测面临标注异常稀缺和专家监督成本高的挑战，需要开发不依赖异常标签的无监督方法。

Method: 使用冻结预训练视觉主干网络，添加微小卷积适配器进行快速领域适应。通过k近邻异常评分和双概率门控机制（距离z-score阈值和SWAG认知不确定性边界）安全扩展正常样本核心集。

Result: 在COVID-CXR数据集上ROC-AUC从0.9489提升至0.9982，F1从0.8048提升至0.9746；在肺炎CXR上ROC-AUC从0.6834提升至0.8968；在脑部MRI ND-5上ROC-AUC从0.6041提升至0.7269，PR-AUC从0.7539提升至0.8211。

Conclusion: 该框架在标签稀缺的医学影像应用中表现出高效性和有效性，能够稳定地细化正常概念，显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

### [8] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了边界距离回归(BDR)和自适应时序精化(ATR)两种互补方法，通过优化边界检测的计算分配，在时序动作定位任务中实现了更精确的边界检测和更高的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时序动作定位方法对所有边界应用统一计算，忽视了不同边界检测难度的显著差异，导致计算资源分配不合理。

Method: 1. BDR：通过有符号距离回归替代分类，提供信息论最优的定位；2. ATR：通过连续深度选择τ∈[0,1]分配计算，实现端到端可微分优化。

Result: 在THUMOS14上，ATR达到56.5% mAP@0.7（162G FLOPs），相比均匀处理的53.6%（198G FLOPs），性能提升2.9%且计算减少18%。BDR可提升现有方法1.8-3.1% mAP@0.7，边界峰值锐化43%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在四个基准测试中验证有效，通过知识蒸馏缓解训练成本，轻量级学生模型在基线成本下保持99%性能。

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

### [9] [Improving Multi-View Reconstruction via Texture-Guided Gaussian-Mesh Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03950)
*Zhejia Cai,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Hongkun Cao,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一处理几何和外观优化的高斯-网格联合优化框架，通过高斯引导的网格可微分渲染同时优化网格几何和顶点颜色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常在几何精度和真实感渲染之间权衡，解耦了几何和外观优化，这阻碍了下游编辑任务。

Method: 通过高斯引导的网格可微分渲染，同时优化网格几何（顶点位置和面）和顶点颜色，利用输入图像的光度一致性和从法线和深度图的几何正则化。

Result: 获得了高质量的3D重建结果，可用于下游编辑任务如重光照和形状变形。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D编辑、AR/VR和数字内容创建等应用提供了统一的几何和外观优化解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

### [10] [A Linear Fractional Transformation Model and Calibration Method for Light Field Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03962)
*Zhong Chen,Changfeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于线性分数变换参数α的光场相机标定方法，通过解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列，包含基于最小二乘的解析解和非线性优化，并改进了原始图像特征检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光场相机内部参数的精确定标是3D重建的关键但具有挑战性的前提条件。

Method: 使用线性分数变换参数α解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列，提出基于最小二乘的解析解和非线性优化方法，并改进了原始图像特征检测。

Result: 在物理和模拟数据上的实验结果验证了所提方法的性能，基于该模型的光场原始图像模拟速度更快。

Conclusion: 该方法为光场相机标定提供了有效解决方案，对数据驱动的深度学习方法具有重要意义。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's
website.

### [11] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Room Envelopes合成数据集，用于训练单目几何估计器预测可见表面和结构布局表面，以理解场景范围和物体形状位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景重建方法只能恢复可见表面，导致重建不完整，而生成模型重建整个物体成本较高。场景结构元素（墙壁、地板、天花板）相对简单易预测，需要更经济的解决方案。

Method: 创建合成数据集提供RGB图像和两个关联点图：可见表面点和移除家具后的结构布局表面点，用于直接监督前馈单目几何估计器。

Result: 该方法能够同时预测第一可见表面和第一布局表面，理解场景的完整范围和物体的形状位置。

Conclusion: Room Envelopes数据集为场景结构元素重建提供了有效的监督方式，使得单目几何估计能够更全面地理解场景布局。

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [12] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 人类通过3D姿态信息识别社交互动，而大多数AI视觉模型缺乏这种能力。研究发现3D关节位置比当前AI模型更能预测人类社交判断，面部位置和方向的简单3D特征就能达到完整关节信息的预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类如何从视觉输入中快速提取社交互动信息，以及为什么先进的AI视觉系统在这方面仍然面临挑战。

Method: 结合最先进的姿态和深度估计算法提取视频中人物的3D关节位置，与AI视觉模型比较预测人类社交判断的能力，并推导出一组紧凑的3D社交姿态特征。

Result: 3D关节位置优于大多数AI视觉模型；仅包含面部位置和方向的简单3D特征与完整关节信息预测能力相当；这些特征能显著提升现成AI模型的性能。

Conclusion: 人类社交场景理解依赖于3D姿态的显式表征，可以通过简单的结构化视觉空间基元来支持。

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

### [13] [CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992)
*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaRF是一个完全可微分的框架，直接在3D高斯空间中操作，通过引入相机感知机制和跨视图监督来解决3D高斯分割中的多视图一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D渲染伪监督和视图特定特征学习，导致跨视图一致性差，需要开发直接在3D高斯空间中操作且能保持多视图一致性的方法。

Method: 提出高斯场相机编码(GFCE)将相机几何融入高斯文本交互，建模视图依赖变化；提出训练配对视图监督(ITPVS)在校准视图间对齐高斯逻辑值，缓解单视图过拟合。

Result: 在三个基准测试上，CaRF在Ref LERF、LERF OVS和3D OVS数据集上分别比最先进方法平均提升16.8%、4.3%和2.0%的mIoU。

Conclusion: CaRF实现了更可靠和视图一致的3D场景理解，对具身AI、AR/VR交互和自主感知具有潜在益处。

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and

*Peiyao Wang,Weining Wang,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhysCorr框架，通过PhysicsRM奖励模型和PhyDPO优化方法，提升视频生成的物理一致性，解决现有模型在物体动态、交互和运动模式上的物理不合理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频生成模型虽然感知质量优秀，但经常违反物理合理性原则，表现为不合理的物体动态、不连贯的交互和不真实的运动模式，这限制了在具身AI、机器人和仿真密集型领域的应用。

Method: 提出PhysCorr统一框架，包含PhysicsRM（首个双维度奖励模型，量化物体内部稳定性和物体间交互）和PhyDPO（基于对比反馈和物理感知重加权的直接偏好优化流程）。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PhysCorr在保持视觉保真度和语义对齐的同时，显著提高了物理真实感。

Conclusion: 这项工作向物理基础和可信赖的视频生成迈出了关键一步，提出的框架与模型无关且可扩展，能够无缝集成到各种视频扩散和基于transformer的骨干网络中。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

TL;DR: 提出GNN-MoE方法，通过图神经网络路由器和混合专家框架，增强视觉Transformer在领域泛化任务中的参数效率微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域泛化任务中，标准微调预训练ViT成本高且可能损害泛化能力，需要高效的参数微调方法。

Method: 使用图神经网络（GCN、GAT、SAGE）作为路由器，在图像块间图上动态分配块到专门的专家，采用高效的Kronecker适配器。

Result: 在领域泛化基准测试中达到最先进或竞争性性能，同时保持高参数效率。

Conclusion: 基于图的上下文路由对于实现鲁棒、轻量级的领域泛化具有重要价值。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks robust Vision Transformer (ViT) performance
on unseen domains. Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging;
standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose
GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead
of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT,
SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to
specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch
relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive DG benchmark performance with high parameter
efficiency, highlighting the utility of graph-based contextual routing for
robust, lightweight DG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉模型在医学影像中因使用自然图像预训练骨干网络而存在的领域差距问题，需要专门针对医学影像优化的基础模型。

Method: 在10个公共来源的120万张多模态胸部图像上从头预训练ViT模型，并提出引导随机调整裁剪的数据增强策略，偏向于解剖相关区域采样。

Result: MedDChest在多种下游诊断任务中显著优于公开可用的ImageNet预训练模型，证明了大规模领域内预训练结合领域特定数据增强的优越性。

Conclusion: MedDChest提供了一个强大且鲁棒的特征提取器，作为各种胸部诊断任务的更好起点，模型权重将公开以促进未来研究。

Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting
point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be
made publicly available to foster future research and applications.

TL;DR: Faithful Contouring是一种稀疏体素化表示方法，支持2048+分辨率，无需将网格转换为场函数或提取等值面，实现近乎无损的保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于等值面的体素化表示严重依赖水密化或渲染优化，这会损害几何保真度。需要一种能够保持锐度和内部结构的高保真表示方法。

Method: 提出Faithful Contouring稀疏体素化表示，设计双模式自编码器，支持可扩展和细节保持的形状重建。

Result: 在直接表示方面达到10^-5级别的距离误差；在网格重建方面，Chamfer距离减少93%，F-score提高35%，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring在3D学习任务中作为表示方法具有卓越的保真度，在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG信号因其无创采集、活体检测特性和低成本可穿戴设备适用性而受到生物认证关注，但面临运动伪影、光照变化和个体生理差异等挑战。

Method: 使用CFIHSR数据集，对PPG信号进行预处理后通过CWT转换为时频图，然后使用CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM混合模型结合空间和时间特征。

Result: 在46个受试者上的实验结果显示认证准确率达到98%，验证了模型对噪声和个体间差异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该系统具有高效性、可扩展性和内在活体检测能力，非常适合现实世界的移动和嵌入式生物安全应用。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bratrix是一个端到端的多模态语言锚定视觉-大脑对齐框架，通过将视觉刺激解耦为层次化视觉和语言语义组件，在共享潜在空间中实现视觉-语言和大脑-语言嵌入的对齐，并引入不确定性感知模块处理噪声神经信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要将神经活动直接与视觉嵌入对齐，但纯视觉表示往往无法捕捉潜在语义维度，限制了可解释性和深度鲁棒性。需要解决主体变异性和视觉特征纠缠问题。

Method: 1. 将视觉刺激解耦为层次化视觉和语言语义组件；2. 在共享潜在空间中对齐视觉和大脑表示；3. 引入不确定性感知模块进行加权对齐；4. 使用可学习的语言锚定语义矩阵增强跨模态相关性；5. 采用两阶段训练策略：单模态预训练后多模态微调。

Result: 在EEG、MEG和fMRI基准测试中，Bratrix在检索、重建和字幕生成任务上优于现有方法，特别是在200路EEG检索任务中提升了14.3%。

Conclusion: Bratrix通过语言锚定的多模态对齐框架，有效解决了神经信号分析中的语义理解问题，为视觉语义从神经信号中解码提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

TL;DR: 比较了两种无配对自监督CT图像去噪方法：CycleGAN残差翻译器和Noise2Score分数匹配去噪器。CycleGAN在PSNR/SSIM指标上表现最佳，而Noise2Score在无配对情况下提供稳健替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在无配对和自监督条件下进行CT图像去噪，评估两种训练数据效率高的方法，以解决缺乏干净配对数据时的去噪问题。

Method: 使用CycleGAN残差翻译器和Noise2Score分数匹配去噪器两种范式，通过配置扫描确定最佳参数设置（lambda_cycle=30, lambda_iden=2, ngf=ndf=64的标准U-Net），并进行长时间训练。

Result: CycleGAN将输入从34.66 dB/0.9234 SSIM提升至38.913 dB/0.971 SSIM，得分1.9441；Noise2Score在绝对PSNR/SSIM上稍逊但能在高噪声输入下取得显著改进。

Conclusion: CycleGAN提供最强的最终图像质量，而Noise2Score在无配对情况下提供具有竞争力的稳健替代方案。

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UKAST是一种结合KANs和Swin Transformer的U-Net架构，用于医学图像分割，在数据稀缺情况下表现优异，超越CNN和Transformer基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临复杂解剖结构和标注数据有限的挑战。CNN擅长局部特征提取但难以建模长距离依赖，Transformer能有效捕获全局上下文但数据需求大且计算昂贵。

Method: 提出UKAST架构，将基于有理函数的Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks集成到Swin Transformer编码器中，利用Group Rational KANs提高表达能力和数据效率。

Result: 在四个2D和3D医学图像分割基准测试中达到最先进性能，在数据稀缺设置下表现尤其优异，FLOPs减少且参数增加很小。

Conclusion: KAN增强的Transformer在数据高效的医学图像分割方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成方法未能充分利用位置信息，导致对对象空间布局理解不足，无法精确控制生成图像中对象的定位。

Method: 提出SpatialLock框架，包含两个组件：位置参与注入(PoI)通过注意力层直接整合空间信息；位置引导学习(PoG)使用基于感知的监督进一步优化对象定位。

Result: 实验表明SpatialLock在精确对象定位方面达到了新的最先进水平，在多个数据集上实现了超过0.9的IOU分数。

Conclusion: SpatialLock能够生成具有精确空间排列的对象，并提高生成图像的视觉质量，为文本到图像生成中的对象定位问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: THG是一种无需训练的策略，通过将CFG ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统，显著加速扩散采样同时保持高保真生成。该方法将噪声估计和额外引导项分别在不同粒度的时间步网格上积分，减少30%函数评估次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散求解器未能充分利用额外引导项对数值误差的鲁棒性，存在计算冗余。研究发现噪声估计和额外引导项对数值误差的敏感性存在显著差异。

Method: 将CFG ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统，噪声估计在细粒度时间步网格上积分（乌龟方程），额外引导项在粗粒度网格上积分（兔子方程）。引入误差边界感知时间步采样器和引导尺度调度器。

Result: 减少高达30%的函数评估次数，生成保真度几乎无损失（ΔImageReward ≤ 0.032），在相同计算预算下优于最先进的基于CFG的无训练加速器。

Conclusion: 多速率公式为扩散求解器提供了新潜力，为实现无需模型重训练的实时高质量图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source
code is available at https://github.com/yhlee-add/THG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有草图生成方法主要关注通用合成，缺乏对草图风格的精确控制机制，需要开发能够通过文本和参考草图进行显式风格引导的方法。

Method: 采用扩散模型框架，将参考特征作为辅助信息引入，使用线性平滑和风格-内容引导机制，避免自注意力中键值矩阵覆盖，并通过联合AdaIN模块支持多风格生成。

Conclusion: M3S框架实现了高质量的草图生成，具有精确的风格对齐和增强的风格控制灵活性，为草图风格控制提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

Conclusion: DMSORT通过创新的双分支架构有效解决了海上多目标跟踪中的相机运动问题，在保持高身份一致性的同时显著提升了跟踪效率。

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试上的实验表明，该框架始终优于仅使用文本教程或转录的强基线代理和变体。分析强调了轨迹分割和选择、动作过滤以及视觉信息的重要性。

Conclusion: 丰富的在线视频可以系统地提炼为可操作的指导，在推理时改进计算机使用代理，证明了从视频中学习对提升代理性能的有效性。

Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but
despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially
when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular
applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap
by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short
segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable
computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.
We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts
them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects
trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a
VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,
and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage
selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context
at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its
next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use
only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of
trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual
information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically
distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at
inference time. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文档理解中，确定扫描或拍摄文档的正确方向是关键的预处理步骤，对于提升OCR性能至关重要，因为用户错误（特别是相机基础方向错误）经常导致图像错位。

Method: 构建了ORB基准测试（包括英文和11种印度语言的语料库），并开发了基于Phi-3.5-Vision视觉编码器的旋转分类管道，采用动态图像裁剪技术，专门针对4类旋转任务进行微调。

Result: 旋转分类方法在两个数据集上分别达到96%和92%的准确率；在模拟真实世界设置中，显著提升了闭源OCR模型（最高14%）和开源权重模型（最高4倍）的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了旋转校正模块在提升OCR性能中的关键作用，特别是在处理用户捕获错误导致的图像旋转问题时。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

Motivation: 在数字病理学中，准确配准不同模态的图像对于生物标志物分析和组织重建等应用至关重要。本研究旨在评估不同颜色变换技术如何影响H&E染色图像与非线性多模态图像的配准性能。

Method: 使用20个组织样本对，应用多种预处理步骤（包括CycleGAN、Macenko、Reinhard、Vahadane等颜色变换方法），采用VALIS配准方法进行刚性和非刚性配准，并通过相对目标配准误差（rTRE）评估配准性能。

Result: 在原始和反转多模态图像两种场景下，CycleGAN颜色变换均实现了最低的配准误差，而其他方法显示出较高的误差。

Conclusion: 在配准前应用颜色变换可以改善不同模态图像之间的对齐效果，支持数字病理学中更可靠的分析。

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协方差描述符在通用计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但在医学图像分析中尚未充分探索。本文旨在研究其在医学图像分类中的有效性，特别是结合预训练视觉编码器。

Method: 提出从预训练通用视觉编码器（DINOv2和MedSAM）提取特征构建协方差描述符，并与手工描述符对比。使用SPDNet网络（专为对称正定矩阵设计）在MedMNIST基准的11个数据集上进行评估。

Result: 基于GVE特征的协方差描述符始终优于基于手工特征的描述符。SPDNet与DINOv2特征结合时，性能优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 结合协方差描述符与强大的预训练视觉编码器在医学图像分析中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for
medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自适应统计融合器(AStF)，通过引入偏度和峰度等更高阶统计量来改进人体运动风格迁移，相比传统仅使用均值和方差的方法能更好地捕捉运动数据的复杂动态模式和时空一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均值和方差的图像风格迁移方法在运动风格迁移中效果有限，因为运动数据具有复杂的动态模式和时空一致性特性，仅靠均值和方差无法充分捕捉这些特性。

Method: 提出自适应统计融合器(AStF)，包含风格解耦模块(SDM)和高阶多统计注意力机制(HOS-Attn)，结合运动一致性正则化(MCR)判别器进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过更全面地建模动态风格的时空统计模式，AStF在运动风格迁移方面表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: 引入偏度和峰度等更高阶统计量能够显著提升运动风格迁移的效果，为运动数据的风格建模提供了更全面的统计框架。

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Motivation: 传统标志点检测依赖领域特定模型，但大规模预训练视觉模型的出现提供了新机会。本文探索人类中心基础模型在医学影像中的潜力，这些模型天生优化了空间姿态定位，为解剖标志点检测提供了强先验。

Method: 通过多数据集预训练将人类中心基础模型Sapiens适应到医学成像领域，提出MedSapiens模型。

Result: MedSapiens在多个数据集上达到最优性能：相比通用模型提升5.26%，相比专业模型提升21.81%的平均成功检测率；在少样本设置下相比少样本最优方法提升2.69%的SDR。

Conclusion: 人类中心基础模型为医学影像中的解剖标志点检测提供了强大且尚未充分利用的潜力，MedSapiens展示了这种适应策略的有效性。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

Motivation: 随着合成图像和深度伪造生成模型的日益复杂，源归属和真实性验证成为计算机视觉系统的关键挑战。扩散模型在输出中无意中留下了持久的统计痕迹（信号泄漏），特别是在潜在表示中。

Method: 在扩散模型的潜在域中操作，通过部分前向扩散重模拟来暴露生成器特定的残留线索。使用时间注意力编码器聚合多步潜在特征，特征加权原型头结构化嵌入空间并实现透明归属。

Result: 仅使用闭集数据训练，达到98.13%的宏AUC，学习的潜在几何结构在后处理下保持鲁棒，超越最先进方法，在已知和未知生成器之间实现强可分离性。

Conclusion: 在潜在空间中建模信号泄漏偏差能够实现可靠且可解释的AI图像和深度伪造取证。

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

TL;DR: 提出DinoGRL框架，利用DINOv2的视觉先验学习步态特征，结合外观线索实现跨模态视频行人重识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注模态不变的外观特征，但忽略了步态特征这种既模态不变又富含时间动态的特征，限制了跨模态视频匹配的时空一致性建模能力。

Method: 提出语义感知轮廓和步态学习模型(SASGL)，利用DINOv2生成增强轮廓表示，并与ReID目标联合优化；开发渐进式双向多粒度增强模块(PBMGE)，在多个空间粒度上实现步态和外观流的双向交互。

Result: 在HITSZ-VCM和BUPT数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DinoGRL框架通过结合DINOv2的视觉先验和步态特征学习，实现了鲁棒的跨模态视频行人重识别，证明了步态特征在跨模态检索中的重要性。

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FastGS展示了强大的通用性，在动态场景重建、表面重建、稀疏视图重建、大规模重建和SLAM等任务中都能提供显著的训练加速效果。

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration

Motivation: 除草剂田间试验需要准确识别植物物种和评估除草剂引起的损伤，但通用视觉基础模型在农业领域的细粒度物种和损伤类型区分方面性能有限，因此需要开发领域专用模型。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法，在大型精选农业数据集上训练领域专用视觉基础模型，学习针对除草剂试验图像的丰富且可迁移的表征。

Result: 领域专用模型在物种识别（F1分数从0.91提升至0.94）和损伤分类（从0.26提升至0.33）上显著优于通用基础模型。在未见条件下表现更佳（物种识别从0.56到0.66；损伤分类从0.17到0.27），在无人机图像等域迁移场景中保持强劲性能（物种分类从0.49到0.60）。

Conclusion: 领域专用基础模型具有强大的泛化能力，能显著减少人工标注工作量，为除草剂试验分析提供可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

Method: 使用合成和真实Sentinel-1卫星图像（来自里海、南海、几内亚湾和巴西海岸）训练YOLOv10目标检测模型，并在三个未见区域（墨西哥湾、北海、波斯湾）进行地理迁移性评估。

Result: 模型在三个未见区域共检测到3,529个海上平台，F1分数从0.85提升至0.90，证明了模型能够泛化到训练区域之外。

Conclusion: 平衡数据集对于模型性能至关重要，合成数据生成是解决遥感中常见挑战的有效策略，展示了深度学习在全球海上基础设施监测中的潜力。

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型依赖预训练文本编码器进行语义对齐，但对简洁提示的理解能力有限，且无法在线重述提示词以更好地匹配用户意图，这限制了模型的可扩展性和可用性。

Method: 提出RISE-T2V框架，创新性地引入重述适配器模块，将提示词重述和语义特征提取整合为单一流程，利用LLM在预测下一个token时的文本隐藏状态作为视频生成条件。

Result: 大量实验证明RISE-T2V是一个通用框架，适用于不同的视频扩散模型架构，显著提升了T2V模型生成高质量、符合用户意图视频的能力。

Conclusion: RISE-T2V通过将提示词重述和语义特征提取无缝集成，有效解决了文本到视频生成中的语义理解不足问题，为T2V任务提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed
Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a
bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the
clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated
segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has
driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the
impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,
usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when
applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,
in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,
voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method
allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native
3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while
significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU
memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context
of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23
challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge
winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%
for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also
offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction
in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an
equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of nine convolutional neural
network architectures for binary classification of horses and motorcycles in
the VOC 2008 dataset. We address the significant class imbalance problem by
implementing minority-class augmentation techniques. Our experiments compare
modern architectures including ResNet-50, ConvNeXt-Tiny, DenseNet-121, and
Vision Transformer across multiple performance metrics. Results demonstrate
substantial performance variations, with ConvNeXt-Tiny achieving the highest

classification tasks and quantifies the impact of data augmentation strategies
in mitigating class imbalance issues in object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了传感器遮挡对BEVFusion架构3D物体检测性能的影响，发现相机遮挡导致41.3% mAP下降，LiDAR在重度遮挡下下降47.3%，融合设置中LiDAR遮挡影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究传感器遮挡（如雾、霾或物理障碍物）对基于BEV的多模态3D物体检测精度的影响，这一问题在现有研究中尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用BEVFusion架构在nuScenes数据集上评估相机和LiDAR遮挡对3D检测性能的影响，采用mAP和NDS作为评估指标。

Result: 仅相机检测在中等遮挡下mAP下降41.3%；LiDAR在重度遮挡下mAP下降47.3%；融合设置中相机遮挡仅导致4.1%下降，而LiDAR遮挡导致26.8%下降，显示模型更依赖LiDAR。

Conclusion: 需要开发遮挡感知的评估方法和改进的传感器融合技术，以在恶劣环境条件下保持检测精度。

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
because of its low-cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges
of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded
systems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model,
BoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters. It can accurately estimate
depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality.
Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which
adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation.
Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the
object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is
deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous
lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed
ablation studies for the proposed methods. The code is available at

*Alan de Aguiar,Michaella Pereira Andrade,Charles Morphy D. Santos,João Paulo Gois*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HideAndSeg是一个用于分割章鱼视频的AI工具，结合SAM2和YOLOv11，通过最小监督实现自动分割，并能处理遮挡情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于章鱼的伪装能力、皮肤快速变化、非刚性变形和频繁遮挡，加上水下光照和浑浊度的变化，在自然栖息地分析章鱼具有挑战性。缺乏大规模标注数据集也限制了相关研究。

Method: 集成SAM2与自定义训练的YOLOv11目标检测器。用户提供点坐标生成初始分割掩码，然后训练YOLO模型。之后通过边界框提示完全自动化流程，无需手动干预。引入两个无监督指标评估分割质量。

Result: HideAndSeg表现令人满意，相比手动提示方法减少了分割噪声。在自然环境中即使完全遮挡后也能重新识别和分割章鱼，而手动提示模型在此情况下会失败。

Conclusion: 通过减少真实场景中手动分析的需求，该工作提供了一个实用工具，为更高效地研究野生头足类动物行为铺平了道路。

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Conclusion: 成功扩展了拼图求解器的处理范围，为凸多边形拼图提供了有效的计算方法，并建立了相关基准数据集。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

Conclusion: V-Thinker为推进图像交互推理应用提供了有价值的见解，展示了端到端强化学习在视觉中心推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

TL;DR: STC-Net是一个用于腹腔镜胆囊切除术中基于Parkland分级量表自动评估手术复杂度的框架，能在完整手术视频中通过弱时间监督进行时间定位和分级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估腹腔镜胆囊切除术的手术复杂度至关重要，严重炎症与更长手术时间和更高并发症风险相关。虽然Parkland分级量表提供了临床验证的炎症严重程度分层框架，但其在手术视频中的自动化应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出STC-Net框架，通过定位、窗口提议和分级模块联合执行时间定位和分级。引入了结合硬软定位目标和背景感知分级监督的新型损失函数，可在完整视频上直接操作。

Result: 在1,859个LC视频的私有数据集上评估，STC-Net达到62.11%的准确率和61.42%的F1分数，比非定位基线在两个指标上都高出10%以上。

Conclusion: STC-Net展示了从完整LC视频中进行基于PGS的自动手术复杂度评估的可扩展有效方法，有望用于术后分析和手术培训。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

Result: Sora-2在视觉中心任务上可与最先进VLMs相媲美，在Eyeballing Games等任务上甚至超越VLMs；在文本中心任务上，MATH准确率达92%，MMMU准确率达75.53%。自一致性和上下文学习可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 视频生成模型有潜力成为统一的多模态理解与生成模型，"Thinking with Video"可作为统一的多模态推理范式。

Abstract: "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly
improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision
Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)
Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or
continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct
modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm
that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and
textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,
we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench
encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing
Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our
evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,
Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even
surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric
tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.
Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also
find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's
performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation
model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,
positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

TL;DR: UniSplat是一个用于自动驾驶的通用前馈3D重建框架，通过统一的潜在时空融合学习鲁棒动态场景重建，解决了稀疏、非重叠相机视图和复杂场景动态的联合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理稀疏、非重叠相机视图和复杂场景动态的联合挑战时存在困难，需要开发能够鲁棒重建动态场景的框架。

Method: 构建3D潜在支架捕获几何和语义场景上下文，引入高效融合机制在3D支架内直接操作实现时空对齐，设计双分支解码器通过点锚定细化和基于体素的生成生成动态感知高斯，维护静态高斯的持久内存实现流式场景补全。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，UniSplat在新视角合成方面达到最先进性能，即使在原始相机覆盖范围之外的视点也能提供鲁棒和高质量的渲染。

Conclusion: UniSplat框架通过统一的潜在时空融合和双分支解码器设计，成功解决了动态场景重建中的关键挑战，实现了高性能的3D重建和渲染。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

TL;DR: PixCLIP是一个新颖的框架，通过同时处理视觉提示输入和长文本描述，解决了CLIP模型在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面存在局限性，主要是由于其文本编码器的token长度限制无法处理更细粒度的长文本信息。现有方法主要关注增强视觉信息处理的粒度，而多模态大语言模型的研究表明，使用长而详细的文本描述训练可以有效改善细粒度视觉语言对齐。

Method: 1. 建立自动标注流程，生成像素级定位的长文本描述；2. 构建LongGRIT数据集（约150万样本）；3. 用LLM替换CLIP的原始文本编码器；4. 提出三分支像素-文本对齐学习框架，实现任意粒度下图像区域与对应文本描述的细粒度对齐。

Result: 实验表明PixCLIP在像素级交互和处理长文本方面取得突破，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PixCLIP通过协同利用增强视觉和文本内容处理粒度的优势，有效解决了CLIP在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面的限制，为像素级视觉语言理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动化框架来评估虚拟免疫组化染色图像质量，通过染色精度指标直接量化像素级标记准确性，发现传统图像保真度指标与染色精度相关性差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型可以从H&E图像生成虚拟IHC染色，但现有评估方法主要关注图像保真度而非染色准确性，需要更可靠的评估框架。

Method: 使用颜色反卷积生成IHC阳性像素掩码，计算Dice、IoU、Hausdorff距离等染色精度指标，无需专家手动标注。

Result: 配对模型如PyramidPix2Pix和AdaptiveNCE染色精度最高，非配对扩散和GAN模型可靠性较差。全玻片图像评估显示补丁级评估无法发现的性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为虚拟IHC模型质量评估提供了可重复的方法，是加速病理学家常规使用的关键步骤。

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的流式视频质量评估模型，该模型无需参考视频且不依赖人工标注，通过利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化来训练时域感知卷积架构，直接预测全参考指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法存在局限性：全参考方法需要干净参考视频，大多数无参考方法依赖昂贵的人工标注，而大多数无监督方法基于图像，忽略了视频对象检测中关键的时域上下文。

Method: 利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化，训练时域感知卷积架构，直接从退化视频预测全参考指标（LPIPS、PSNR、SSIM），在推理时无需参考视频。

Result: 流式方法优于图像基线，能够泛化到多种退化类型；与广泛使用的BRISQUE相比，与全参考指标的相关性更高。

Conclusion: 时域建模对于现实世界视觉系统中可扩展的视频质量评估具有重要价值，提出的时域感知、无监督方法有效且可扩展。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

TL;DR: 偏振分辨近红外成像通过测量眼组织反射光的偏振状态，为眼动追踪提供了额外的光学对比机制。偏振眼动追踪系统使用偏振滤光片阵列相机和线性偏振近红外光源，能够在巩膜上显示可追踪特征和在角膜上显示注视信息模式。

Motivation: 传统基于强度的眼动追踪系统在某些条件下性能受限，偏振成像可以提供额外的对比机制来提高眼动追踪的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用偏振滤光片阵列相机配合线性偏振近红外光源构建偏振眼动追踪系统，通过卷积神经网络对346名参与者的数据进行训练。

Result: 与仅基于强度的基线系统相比，偏振眼动追踪系统在正常条件、眼睑遮挡、眼距变化和瞳孔大小变化等情况下，将中位95百分位绝对注视误差降低了10-16%。

Conclusion: 偏振光-组织相互作用效应为人机交互带来了实际改进，偏振眼动追踪作为一种简单、鲁棒的传感模式，有望应用于未来的可穿戴设备。

Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast
mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light
reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we
demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically,
we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed
of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized
near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and
gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only
images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based
machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median
95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched
intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid
occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link
light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer
interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future
wearable devices.

*Ellis Brown,Jihan Yang,Shusheng Yang,Rob Fergus,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种诊断和去偏多模态基准测试的方法，通过测试集压力测试和迭代偏置剪枝来识别和消除非视觉偏差，确保基准测试真正评估视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）的基准测试存在严重问题，模型可以通过利用偏差、语言先验和表面模式来获得高分，而不需要真正的视觉理解能力，这削弱了基准测试的有效性。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）测试集压力测试（TsT）方法，通过仅使用测试集的文本输入进行k折交叉验证来揭示捷径性能；2）迭代偏置剪枝（IBP）程序，通过过滤高偏差样本来去偏基准测试。

Result: 在四个基准测试（VSI-Bench、CV-Bench、MMMU和VideoMME）中发现了普遍的非视觉偏差，并通过案例研究创建了VSI-Bench-Debiased，显著降低了非视觉可解性并扩大了视觉盲性能差距。

Conclusion: 基准测试设计应采用诊断原则，主动识别和消除非视觉偏差，确保真正评估模型的视觉理解能力，而非利用测试集模式。

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

TL;DR: SIMS-V是一个利用3D模拟器生成空间丰富视频训练数据的框架，通过系统消融研究发现三个关键问题类别（度量测量、视角依赖推理和时间跟踪）能最有效地开发可转移的空间智能，仅用25K模拟样本训练的7B参数视频LLM在真实世界空间推理基准上超越了72B基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态语言模型在时空空间推理方面存在困难，而获取具有精确空间标注的多样化真实世界视频数据是一个瓶颈。

Method: 利用3D模拟器的特权信息创建空间丰富的视频训练数据，通过系统消融研究问题类型、混合和规模，识别最有效的三个问题类别。

Result: 仅用25K模拟样本训练的7B参数视频LLM在真实世界空间推理基准上超越了72B基线模型，与专有模型竞争，同时在通用视频理解上保持性能。

Conclusion: 模拟数据可以高效开发可转移的空间智能，三个关键问题类别足以实现强大的真实世界泛化能力，而无需全面覆盖所有问题类型。

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态智能系统主要停留在反应式任务驱动和暴力长上下文处理，缺乏真正的空间认知和世界建模能力，需要向更全面的超感知范式发展。

Method: 提出了VSI-SUPER两阶段基准测试（VSR和VSC），创建了VSI-590K数据集训练Cambrian-S模型，并开发了基于预测误差的自监督下一潜在帧预测器来驱动记忆和事件分割。

Result: 在VSI-Bench上实现了+30%的绝对改进，但在VSI-SUPER上性能仍然有限；预测感知方法显著优于领先的专有基线模型。

Conclusion: 仅靠规模扩展不足以实现空间超感知，需要能够预见、选择和组织经验的预测性模型，预测感知是实现真正空间超感知的关键路径。

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely
discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a
single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of
generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long
interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,
outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some
diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model
generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading
diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete
autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p
videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient,
high-quality video generation.

Motivation: 现实世界中的物体经常经历状态转换（如苹果被切成块、蝴蝶破茧而出），现有方法在物体外观发生显著变化时容易丢失跟踪目标。

Method: TubeletGraph系统首先识别可能被忽略的轨迹，基于语义和邻近性先验决定是否整合这些轨迹，然后推理添加的轨迹并生成描述每个观察到的转换的状态图。

Result: TubeletGraph在状态转换下实现了最先进的跟踪性能，展示了对物体转换的深入理解，以及在复杂物体转换的时间定位和语义推理方面的有前景能力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了物体状态转换跟踪的挑战，提供了对物体动态演变的更深入理解，并发布了VOST-TAS基准数据集。

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at
