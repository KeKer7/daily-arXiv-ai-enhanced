### [1] [SoC-DT: Standard-of-Care Aligned Digital Twins for Patient-Specific Tumor Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03287)
*Moinak Bhattacharya,Gagandeep Singh,Prateek Prasanna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了标准护理数字孪生(SoC-DT)框架，统一反应扩散肿瘤生长模型和离散治疗干预，结合基因组和人口统计学个性化，预测治疗后肿瘤结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测标准护理治疗下的肿瘤轨迹是肿瘤学中未满足的重要需求，传统反应扩散模型无法捕捉异质性治疗范式下的肿瘤动态。

Method: 开发了可微分框架SoC-DT，结合反应扩散肿瘤生长模型、离散标准护理干预(手术、化疗、放疗)以及基因组和人口统计学个性化；提出了IMEX-SoC隐式-显式指数时间差分求解器，确保稳定性、正性和可扩展性。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界胶质瘤数据上的评估显示，SoC-DT在预测肿瘤动态方面始终优于经典PDE基线和纯数据驱动的神经模型。

Conclusion: SoC-DT通过将机制可解释性与现代可微分求解器相结合，为肿瘤学中患者特异性数字孪生建立了原则性基础，实现了生物学一致的肿瘤动态估计。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of tumor trajectories under standard-of-care (SoC)
therapies remains a major unmet need in oncology. This capability is essential
for optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression.
Conventional reaction-diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to
capture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is
hence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically
simulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in
genomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care
Digital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies
reaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery,
chemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization
to predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit
exponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures
stability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated
on both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently
outperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in
predicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern
differentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for
patient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent
tumor dynamics estimation. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

### [2] [Visualizing Celebrity Dynamics in Video Content: A Proposed Approach Using Face Recognition Timestamp Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03292)
*Doğanay Demir,İlknur Durgar Elkahlout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个结合分布式多GPU推理系统和交互式可视化平台的混合框架，用于分析视频剧集中的名人动态，支持大规模视频数据处理和多维度可视化分析。

Abstract: In an era dominated by video content, understanding its structure and
dynamics has become increasingly important. This paper presents a hybrid
framework that combines a distributed multi-GPU inference system with an
interactive visualization platform for analyzing celebrity dynamics in video
episodes. The inference framework efficiently processes large volumes of video
data by leveraging optimized ONNX models, heterogeneous batch inference, and
high-throughput parallelism, ensuring scalable generation of timestamped
appearance records. These records are then transformed into a comprehensive
suite of visualizations, including appearance frequency charts, duration
analyses, pie charts, co-appearance matrices, network graphs, stacked area
charts, seasonal comparisons, and heatmaps. Together, these visualizations
provide multi-dimensional insights into video content, revealing patterns in
celebrity prominence, screen-time distribution, temporal dynamics,
co-appearance relationships, and intensity across episodes and seasons. The
interactive nature of the system allows users to dynamically explore data,
identify key moments, and uncover evolving relationships between individuals.
By bridging distributed recognition with structured, visually-driven analytics,
this work enables new possibilities for entertainment analytics, content
creation strategies, and audience engagement studies.

### [3] [Domain-Robust Marine Plastic Detection Using Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03294)
*Saanvi Kataria*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了不同模型在水下塑料垃圾跨域检测中的性能，发现轻量级CNN模型MobileNetV2表现最佳，而零样本模型CLIP和Gemini各有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋塑料污染是紧迫的环境威胁，需要可靠的水下垃圾自动检测系统。但由于域偏移问题，在一个数据集上训练的系统在新图像上性能会下降。

Method: 训练CNN模型（MobileNetV2、ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0）和视觉变换器（DeiT-Tiny、ViT-B16）于标注的水下数据集，并在跨域测试集上评估。同时评估了零样本模型CLIP ViT-L14和Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Result: MobileNetV2在跨域检测中表现最佳（F1 0.97），所有微调模型都实现了高精度（约99%），但在召回率上存在差异。CLIP召回率约80%但精度较低（约56%），Gemini则相反（精度约99%，召回率约81%）。

Conclusion: 经过监督训练的紧凑CNN能有效泛化用于跨域水下检测，而大型预训练视觉语言模型提供了互补优势。

Abstract: Marine plastic pollution is a pressing environmental threat, making reliable
automation for underwater debris detection essential. However, vision systems
trained on one dataset often degrade on new imagery due to domain shift. This
study benchmarks models for cross-domain robustness, training convolutional
neural networks - CNNs (MobileNetV2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (DeiT-Tiny, ViT-B16) on a labeled underwater dataset and then
evaluates them on a balanced cross-domain test set built from plastic-positive
images drawn from a different source and negatives from the training domain.
Two zero-shot models were assessed, CLIP ViT-L14 and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash,
that leverage pretraining to classify images without fine-tuning. Results show
the lightweight MobileNetV2 delivers the strongest cross-domain performance (F1
0.97), surpassing larger models. All fine-tuned models achieved high Precision
(around 99%), but differ in Recall, indicating varying sensitivity to plastic
instances. Zero-shot CLIP is comparatively sensitive (Recall around 80%) yet
prone to false positives (Precision around 56%), whereas Gemini exhibits the
inverse profile (Precision around 99%, Recall around 81%). Error analysis
highlights recurring confusions with coral textures, suspended particulates,
and specular glare. Overall, compact CNNs with supervised training can
generalize effectively for cross-domain underwater detection, while large
pretrained vision-language models provide complementary strengths.

### [4] [Multimodal Arabic Captioning with Interpretable Visual Concept Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03295)
*Passant Elchafei,Amany Fashwan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLCAP是一个阿拉伯语图像描述框架，通过CLIP视觉标签检索与多模态文本生成相结合，生成可解释且文化连贯的阿拉伯语图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的端到端图像描述方法缺乏可解释性，VLCAP旨在通过基于视觉概念检索的生成方法，为阿拉伯语图像描述提供更可靠和可解释的解决方案。

Method: 使用三种多语言编码器(mCLIP、AraCLIP、Jina V4)进行视觉标签检索，构建包含训练描述和约21K通用领域标签的混合词汇表，然后将检索到的标签转换为阿拉伯语提示，与原始图像一起输入视觉语言模型(Qwen-VL和Gemini Pro Vision)生成描述。

Result: mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision组合在BLEU-1(5.34%)和余弦相似度(60.01%)上表现最佳，而AraCLIP + Qwen-VL在LLM-judge评分(36.33%)上最高。

Conclusion: VLCAP的可解释流水线能够生成文化连贯且上下文准确的阿拉伯语图像描述，为阿拉伯语多模态理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present VLCAP, an Arabic image captioning framework that integrates
CLIP-based visual label retrieval with multimodal text generation. Rather than
relying solely on end-to-end captioning, VLCAP grounds generation in
interpretable Arabic visual concepts extracted with three multilingual
encoders, mCLIP, AraCLIP, and Jina V4, each evaluated separately for label
retrieval. A hybrid vocabulary is built from training captions and enriched
with about 21K general domain labels translated from the Visual Genome dataset,
covering objects, attributes, and scenes. The top-k retrieved labels are
transformed into fluent Arabic prompts and passed along with the original image
to vision-language models. In the second stage, we tested Qwen-VL and Gemini
Pro Vision for caption generation, resulting in six encoder-decoder
configurations. The results show that mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision achieved the
best BLEU-1 (5.34%) and cosine similarity (60.01%), while AraCLIP + Qwen-VL
obtained the highest LLM-judge score (36.33%). This interpretable pipeline
enables culturally coherent and contextually accurate Arabic captions.

### [5] [Convolutional Neural Nets vs Vision Transformers: A SpaceNet Case Study with Balanced vs Imbalanced Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03297)
*Akshar Gothi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对比EfficientNet-B0和ViT-Base在SpaceNet数据集上的性能，分别在类别不平衡和平衡两种标签分布下进行评估，包括准确率、F1分数、延迟等指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较卷积神经网络和视觉Transformer在遥感图像分类任务中的性能差异，特别关注标签分布不平衡对模型性能的影响。

Method: 在SpaceNet数据集上进行控制实验，设置两种标签分布：自然不平衡的五类分割和平衡重采样分割（每类700张图像）。使用相同的预处理（224x224，ImageNet归一化）、轻量级数据增强和40轮训练预算，在单个NVIDIA P100上评估。

Result: 在不平衡分割下，EfficientNet-B0达到93%测试准确率，具有更强的macro-F1和更低的延迟；ViT-Base也达到93%但参数量更大、运行时间更长。在平衡分割下，两种模型表现都很强，EfficientNet-B0达到99%，ViT-Base保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 平衡标签分布可以缩小架构差距，但CNN在效率方面仍保持优势。发布了清单、日志和每张图像的预测以支持可重复性。

Abstract: We present a controlled comparison of a convolutional neural network
(EfficientNet-B0) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) on SpaceNet under two
label-distribution regimes: a naturally imbalanced five-class split and a
balanced-resampled split with 700 images per class (70:20:10 train/val/test).
With matched preprocessing (224x224, ImageNet normalization), lightweight
augmentations, and a 40-epoch budget on a single NVIDIA P100, we report
accuracy, macro-F1, balanced accuracy, per-class recall, and deployment metrics
(model size and latency). On the imbalanced split, EfficientNet-B0 reaches 93%
test accuracy with strong macro-F1 and lower latency; ViT-Base is competitive
at 93% with a larger parameter count and runtime. On the balanced split, both
models are strong; EfficientNet-B0 reaches 99% while ViT-Base remains
competitive, indicating that balancing narrows architecture gaps while CNNs
retain an efficiency edge. We release manifests, logs, and per-image
predictions to support reproducibility.

Conclusion: 通过将视觉AI进展与实际部署考虑相结合，为开发下一代感知系统以增强弱势道路使用者安全提供了基础参考，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, remains a critical global challenge, as conventional
infrastructure-based measures often prove inadequate in dynamic urban
environments. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in
visual perception and reasoning, open new opportunities for proactive and
context-aware VRU protection. However, existing surveys on AI applications for
VRUs predominantly focus on detection, offering limited coverage of other
vision-based tasks that are essential for comprehensive VRU understanding and
protection. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent progress in
camera-based AI sensing systems for VRU safety, with an emphasis on
developments from the past five years and emerging research trends. We
systematically examine four core tasks, namely detection and classification,
tracking and reidentification, trajectory prediction, and intent recognition
and prediction, which together form the backbone of AI-empowered proactive
solutions for VRU protection in intelligent transportation systems. To guide
future research, we highlight four major open challenges from the perspectives
of data, model, and deployment. By linking advances in visual AI with practical
considerations for real-world implementation, this survey aims to provide a
foundational reference for the development of next-generation sensing systems
to enhance VRU safety.

### [7] [The View From Space: Navigating Instrumentation Differences with EOFMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03316)
*Ryan P. Demilt,Nicholas LaHaye,Karis Tenneson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 地球观测基础模型对传感器架构高度敏感，当前模型设计存在跨模态应用时的表示空间不一致问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地球观测基础模型大多在单一模态数据上训练，但在跨模态应用时直接匹配波段，不清楚不同传感器架构对模型内部表示的影响

Method: 分析EOFMs表示空间对传感器架构的敏感性，研究不同传感器架构对模型内部表示的影响

Result: 发现EOFMs的表示空间对传感器架构高度敏感，理解这种差异对模型设计和使用至关重要

Conclusion: 需要从稳健的遥感科学角度重新思考EOFMs的设计，考虑传感器架构差异对表示空间的影响

Abstract: Earth Observation Foundation Models (EOFMs) have exploded in prevalence as
tools for processing the massive volumes of remotely sensed and other earth
observation data, and for delivering impact on the many essential earth
monitoring tasks. An emerging trend posits using the outputs of pre-trained
models as 'embeddings' which summarize high dimensional data to be used for
generic tasks such as similarity search and content-specific queries. However,
most EOFM models are trained only on single modalities of data and then applied
or benchmarked by matching bands across different modalities. It is not clear
from existing work what impact diverse sensor architectures have on the
internal representations of the present suite of EOFMs. We show in this work
that the representation space of EOFMs is highly sensitive to sensor
architecture and that understanding this difference gives a vital perspective
on the pitfalls of current EOFM design and signals for how to move forward as
model developers, users, and a community guided by robust remote-sensing
science.

### [8] [Photorealistic Inpainting for Perturbation-based Explanations in Ecological Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03317)
*Günel Aghakishiyeva,Jiayi Zhou,Saagar Arya,James David Poling,Holly R. Houliston,Jamie N. Womble,David W. Johnston,Brinnae Bent*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于修复引导的扰动解释技术，通过生成逼真的局部编辑来揭示生态监测视觉模型预测的关键形态特征，提高AI在生态学中的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态监测中自动化视觉模型的不透明预测限制了信任和实际应用，需要可解释的方法来揭示模型决策依据。

Method: 使用修复引导的扰动技术，结合Segment-Anything-Model精炼的掩码，进行对象移除/替换和背景替换，生成保持场景上下文的光逼真编辑。

Result: 该方法能够定位诊断性结构，避免传统扰动的删除伪影，在港口海豹检测任务中通过翻转率和置信度下降评估，获得生态学相关的解释。

Conclusion: 该解释技术为生态学AI部署提供了领域相关的洞察，支持专家验证并提高模型可信度。

Abstract: Ecological monitoring is increasingly automated by vision models, yet opaque
predictions limit trust and field adoption. We present an inpainting-guided,
perturbation-based explanation technique that produces photorealistic,
mask-localized edits that preserve scene context. Unlike masking or blurring,
these edits stay in-distribution and reveal which fine-grained morphological
cues drive predictions in tasks such as species recognition and trait
attribution. We demonstrate the approach on a YOLOv9 detector fine-tuned for
harbor seal detection in Glacier Bay drone imagery, using
Segment-Anything-Model-refined masks to support two interventions: (i) object
removal/replacement (e.g., replacing seals with plausible ice/water or boats)
and (ii) background replacement with original animals composited onto new
scenes. Explanations are assessed by re-scoring perturbed images (flip rate,
confidence drop) and by expert review for ecological plausibility and
interpretability. The resulting explanations localize diagnostic structures,
avoid deletion artifacts common to traditional perturbations, and yield
domain-relevant insights that support expert validation and more trustworthy
deployment of AI in ecology.

Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) stands as a cornerstone in medical image
analysis, playing a pivotal role in precise diagnostics, treatment planning,
and monitoring of various medical conditions. This paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic survey of MIS methodologies, bridging the gap
between traditional image processing techniques and modern deep learning
approaches. The survey encompasses thresholding, edge detection, region-based
segmentation, clustering algorithms, and model-based techniques while also
delving into state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), and the widely
adopted U-Net and its variants. Moreover, integrating attention mechanisms,
semi-supervised learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and
Transformer-based models is thoroughly explored. In addition to covering
established methods, this survey highlights emerging trends, including hybrid
architectures, cross-modality learning, federated and distributed learning
frameworks, and active learning strategies, which aim to address challenges
such as limited labeled datasets, computational complexity, and model
generalizability across diverse imaging modalities. Furthermore, a specialized
case study on lumbar spine segmentation is presented, offering insights into
the challenges and advancements in this relatively underexplored anatomical
region. Despite significant progress in the field, critical challenges persist,
including dataset bias, domain adaptation, interpretability of deep learning
models, and integration into real-world clinical workflows.

### [10] [DECOR: Deep Embedding Clustering with Orientation Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03328)
*Fiona Victoria Stanley Jothiraj,Arunaggiri Pandian Karunanidhi,Seth A. Eichmeyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DECOR是一个面向晶圆缺陷检测的深度聚类框架，通过考虑晶圆图的方向变化，能够在复杂、不平衡、未标记的数据条件下可靠地聚类缺陷模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体制造中，晶圆缺陷的早期检测对产品良率优化至关重要，但原始晶圆数据通常复杂、未标记、不平衡且可能包含多种缺陷，需要设计在非理想数据条件下仍可靠的聚类方法。

Method: DECOR是一个具有方向鲁棒性的深度聚类框架，能够将晶圆图中的复杂缺陷模式分组为一致的簇，特别考虑了晶圆图的方向变化，确保空间相似的缺陷无论其旋转或对齐方式如何都能被一致聚类。

Result: 在MixedWM38数据集上的实验表明，DECOR能够无需手动调参即可发现簇，并且优于现有的聚类基线方法。

Conclusion: DECOR为自动化视觉检测系统提供了一个可靠且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, early detection of wafer defects is critical
for product yield optimization. However, raw wafer data from wafer quality
tests are often complex, unlabeled, imbalanced and can contain multiple defects
on a single wafer, making it crucial to design clustering methods that remain
reliable under such imperfect data conditions. We introduce DECOR, a deep
clustering with orientation robustness framework that groups complex defect
patterns from wafer maps into consistent clusters. We evaluate our method on
the open source MixedWM38 dataset, demonstrating its ability to discover
clusters without manual tuning. DECOR explicitly accounts for orientation
variations in wafer maps, ensuring that spatially similar defects are
consistently clustered regardless of its rotation or alignment. Experiments
indicate that our method outperforms existing clustering baseline methods, thus
providing a reliable and scalable solution in automated visual inspection
systems.

### [11] [Error correction in multiclass image classification of facial emotion on unbalanced samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03337)
*Andrey A. Lebedev,Victor B. Kazantsev,Sergey V. Stasenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LSTM和注意力机制的面部表情分类方法，专门针对类别不平衡问题，通过错误校正技术提高对小类别的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部表情识别中类别不平衡问题，其中某些情绪类别样本数量显著多于其他类别，影响分类器对小类别的识别能力。

Method: 使用基于LSTM的神经网络模型，集成注意力机制聚焦于面部关键区域；训练时采用六类别子集训练，然后对第七个类别进行错误校正。

Result: 实验表明所有类别都能进行校正，但成功率不同；在测试集上，对小类别的关键质量指标有所提升，表明该方法在寻找罕见事件方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效应用于面部表情分析系统，并在类别分布不平衡的情况下提供稳定的分类性能，特别适用于反欺诈等需要检测罕见事件的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of error correction in multi-class
classification of face images on unbalanced samples. The study is based on the
analysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional
states of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem
of class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others.
To solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with
an attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative
for emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is
trained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with
subsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training
stage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although
the degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are
worse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an
increase in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates
the promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the
search for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed
method can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in
tasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution.

TL;DR: 提出了DCG-Bench基准测试，评估多模态大语言模型在动态图表生成任务中的能力，并开发了Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B模型，在三个任务上平均性能提升8.31%，与专有模型性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在静态图表生成和理解方面取得显著进展，但它们在动态图表生成和处理方面的潜力仍未充分探索，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 构建了DCG-8K高质量数据集，包含指令-代码-视频三元组和QA对；采用两阶段训练方法，提出联合代码-视觉奖励的组相对策略优化来构建专家模型。

Result: 基准测试显示现有MLLM在视觉到图表任务中存在不足；提出的模型在三个任务上平均性能提升8.31%，仅用3B参数就达到了与专有模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的训练方法有效，证明了MLLM在动态图表生成任务中的潜力，代码和数据集将公开可用。

Abstract: Dynamic Chart Generation (DCG) involves producing code-rendered animated
visualizations as charts. While recent advances in multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs) have significantly improved their capability on static chart
generation and comprehension, MLLMs' potential for handling dynamic chart
generation and understanding remains underexplored. To bridge this research
gap, we introduce DCG-Bench (Dynamic Chart Generation Benchmark), the first
benchmark evaluating MLLM's capability on dynamic chart generation tasks from
three dimensions: Simple Text-to-Chart, Detailed Text-to-Chart, and
Video-to-Chart tasks. We construct DCG-8K, a high-quality DCG dataset with
annotations covering instruction-code-video triplets and QA pairs for both code
and video evaluation. Based on DCG-8K, we explored a two-stage training recipe,
proposing Joint-Code-Visual Reward for group relative policy optimization to
construct expert MLLM Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B for the DCG task. Our benchmarking
result reveals shortcomings of existing MLLMs in the visual-to-chart task, and
our model beats the best open-sourced MLLM with an average 8.31% performance
gain across three tasks, and shows on par performance against proprietary
models with only 3B parameters, proving the effectiveness of our training
recipe. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

*Vlardimir Yugay,Duy-Kien Nguyen,Theo Gevers,Cees G. M. Snoek,Martin R. Oswald*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoT是一个端到端的单目视觉里程计Transformer模型，直接预测相机运动而无需估计稠密几何或依赖手工组件，在速度和精度上都优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统视觉里程计方法依赖复杂手工组件、需要相机标定和超参数调优、在未知场景泛化能力差的问题，以及现有大规模3D模型在长视频处理和逐帧精度方面的局限性。

Method: 提出VoT（Visual odometry Transformer），通过时空注意力机制处理单目帧序列，直接预测相机运动，无需捆集调整、特征匹配、相机标定或稠密3D重建，可灵活集成各种预训练编码器作为特征提取器。

Result: VoT在更大数据集上有效扩展，受益于更强的预训练骨干网络，在不同相机运动和标定设置下泛化良好，性能优于传统方法且运行速度快3倍以上。

Conclusion: 单目视觉里程计可以通过端到端方式有效解决，VoT证明了这种方法的可行性和优势，为视觉里程计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern monocular visual odometry methods typically combine pre-trained deep
learning components with optimization modules, resulting in complex pipelines
that rely heavily on camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning, and often
struggle in unseen real-world scenarios. Recent large-scale 3D models trained
on massive amounts of multi-modal data have partially alleviated these
challenges, providing generalizable dense reconstruction and camera pose
estimation. Still, they remain limited in handling long videos and providing
accurate per-frame estimates, which are required for visual odometry. In this
work, we demonstrate that monocular visual odometry can be addressed
effectively in an end-to-end manner, thereby eliminating the need for
handcrafted components such as bundle adjustment, feature matching, camera
calibration, or dense 3D reconstruction. We introduce VoT, short for Visual
odometry Transformer, which processes sequences of monocular frames by
extracting features and modeling global relationships through temporal and
spatial attention. Unlike prior methods, VoT directly predicts camera motion
without estimating dense geometry and relies solely on camera poses for
supervision. The framework is modular and flexible, allowing seamless
integration of various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. Experimental
results demonstrate that VoT scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits
substantially from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse
camera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods
while running more than 3 times faster. The code will be released.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse
problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that
could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely
ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search
algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a
manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate
and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based
guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be
seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image
reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse
problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring
tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that
our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance
of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior
performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward
gradient-based guidance algorithms. The code is available at

Abstract: Sonar images are relevant for advancing underwater exploration, autonomous
navigation, and ecosystem monitoring. However, the progress depends on data
availability. The scarcity of publicly available, well-annotated sonar image
datasets creates a significant bottleneck for the development of robust machine
learning models. This paper presents a comprehensive and concise review of the
current landscape of sonar image datasets, seeking not only to catalog existing
resources but also to contextualize them, identify gaps, and provide a clear
roadmap, serving as a base guide for researchers of any kind who wish to start
or advance in the field of underwater acoustic data analysis. We mapped
publicly accessible datasets across various sonar modalities, including Side
Scan Sonar (SSS), Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS), Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS),
Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES), and Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar
(DIDSON). An analysis was conducted on applications such as classification,
detection, segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. This work focuses on
state-of-the-art advancements, incorporating newly released datasets. The
findings are synthesized into a master table and a chronological timeline,
offering a clear and accessible comparison of characteristics, sizes, and
annotation details datasets.

Conclusion: 溯源网络为现有可解释性技术提供了补充方法，虽然引入额外计算成本且目前适用于中等规模数据集，但显著提升了神经模型的透明度、鲁棒性和可信度。

Abstract: We introduce provenance networks, a novel class of neural models designed to
provide end-to-end, training-data-driven explainability. Unlike conventional
post-hoc methods, provenance networks learn to link each prediction directly to
its supporting training examples as part of the model's normal operation,
embedding interpretability into the architecture itself. Conceptually, the
model operates similarly to a learned KNN, where each output is justified by
concrete exemplars weighted by relevance in the feature space. This approach
facilitates systematic investigations of the trade-off between memorization and
generalization, enables verification of whether a given input was included in
the training set, aids in the detection of mislabeled or anomalous data points,
enhances resilience to input perturbations, and supports the identification of
similar inputs contributing to the generation of a new data point. By jointly
optimizing the primary task and the explainability objective, provenance
networks offer insights into model behavior that traditional deep networks
cannot provide. While the model introduces additional computational cost and
currently scales to moderately sized datasets, it provides a complementary
approach to existing explainability techniques. In particular, it addresses
critical challenges in modern deep learning, including model opaqueness,
hallucination, and the assignment of credit to data contributors, thereby
improving transparency, robustness, and trustworthiness in neural models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了统一成本过滤（UCF）框架，用于改进无监督异常检测（UAD）方法。UCF通过构建成本体积并应用可学习的过滤模块来减少匹配噪声，在单模态和多模态UAD场景中都取得了新的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UAD方法存在匹配噪声问题，且单模态和多模态方法相互孤立，缺乏统一理解。本文旨在为单模态和多模态UAD提供一个统一的匹配视角解决方案。

Method: 提出统一成本过滤（UCF）框架：1）构建成本体积（测试样本与正常样本的匹配）；2）使用多层注意力引导的可学习过滤模块来减少匹配噪声并突出细微异常。

Result: 在22个不同基准测试上的综合实验表明，UCF能够有效增强各种UAD方法，在单模态（RGB）和多模态（RGB-3D、RGB-Text）UAD场景中均取得新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: UCF是一个通用的后处理细化框架，能够有效解决UAD中的匹配噪声问题，为单模态和多模态UAD提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to identify image- and pixel-level
anomalies using only normal training data, with wide applications such as
industrial inspection and medical analysis, where anomalies are scarce due to
privacy concerns and cold-start constraints. Existing methods, whether
reconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based
(pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level
matching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely
overlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal
RGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D
and RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models.
Despite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a
comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate
unified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching
perspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a
generic post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any
UAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against
normal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable
filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample,
mitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in
enhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art
results in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB--3D, RGB--Text) UAD
scenarios. Code and models will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业图纸数字化过程中缺乏自动评估对象检测输出质量的方法，虽然对象检测算法已有显著进步，但质量评估仍是挑战。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型(VLMs)的多模态能力来识别缺失或不一致的检测结果，指导检测结果的优化。

Result: 该框架能够实现工业图纸对象检测结果的自动化质量评估，并提升整体检测性能。

Conclusion: 提出的VLM框架填补了工业图纸数字化过程中对象检测质量评估的空白，为构建数字孪生和智能工业自动化提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Industrial diagrams such as piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are
essential for the design, operation, and maintenance of industrial plants.
Converting these diagrams into digital form is an important step toward
building digital twins and enabling intelligent industrial automation. A
central challenge in this digitalization process is accurate object detection.
Although recent advances have significantly improved object detection
algorithms, there remains a lack of methods to automatically evaluate the
quality of their outputs. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a
framework that employs Visual Language Models (VLMs) to assess object detection
results and guide their refinement. The approach exploits the multimodal
capabilities of VLMs to identify missing or inconsistent detections, thereby
enabling automated quality assessment and improving overall detection
performance on complex industrial diagrams.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal reasoning but still
face challenges in spatial reasoning for 3D scenes and complex object
configurations. To address this, we introduce SpatialViLT, an enhanced VLM that
integrates spatial features like depth maps, 3D coordinates, and edge maps
through a multi-task learning framework. This approach enriches multimodal
embeddings with spatial understanding. We propose two variants: SpatialViLT and
MaskedSpatialViLT, focusing on full and masked object regions, respectively.
Additionally, SpatialEnsemble combines both approaches, achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy. Our models excel in spatial reasoning categories
such as directional, topological, and proximity relations, as demonstrated on
the challenging Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset. This work represents a
significant step in enhancing the spatial intelligence of AI systems, crucial
for advanced multimodal understanding and real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用编码器-解码器网络减少两相光学切片结构光照明的伪影，通过合成训练数据解决缺乏干净地面真实数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两相光学切片结构照明中，减少采集时间会引入残留伪影，传统去噪方法难以有效抑制，且监督训练缺乏干净的光学切片地面真实数据。

Method: 使用非对称去噪自编码器和U-Net网络，通过将真实伪影场应用于合成图像来创建合成训练对，然后在真实OS-SI图像上进行评估。

Result: 两种网络都提高了图像清晰度，各自在不同类型的伪影上表现优异。

Conclusion: 合成训练能够实现OS-SI图像的监督去噪，编码器-解码器网络有潜力简化重建工作流程。

Abstract: Structured illumination (SI) enhances image resolution and contrast by
projecting patterned light onto a sample. In two-phase optical-sectioning SI
(OS-SI), reduced acquisition time introduces residual artifacts that
conventional denoising struggles to suppress. Deep learning offers an
alternative to traditional methods; however, supervised training is limited by
the lack of clean, optically sectioned ground-truth data. We investigate
encoder-decoder networks for artifact reduction in two-phase OS-SI, using
synthetic training pairs formed by applying real artifact fields to synthetic
images. An asymmetrical denoising autoencoder (DAE) and a U-Net are trained on
the synthetic data, then evaluated on real OS-SI images. Both networks improve
image clarity, with each excelling against different artifact types. These
results demonstrate that synthetic training enables supervised denoising of
OS-SI images and highlight the potential of encoder-decoder networks to
streamline reconstruction workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEaRL是一个多模态框架，通过通路激活分数整合组织病理学和空间转录组学，使用transformer编码通路信号并通过对比学习与组织学特征对齐，在多个癌症数据集中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法主要依赖少量高变基因，限制了预测范围并忽略了协调的生物学程序，需要更全面地整合生物通路信息。

Method: 使用ssGSEA计算通路激活分数，通过transformer编码通路信号，采用对比学习将通路特征与组织学特征对齐。

Result: 在三个癌症ST数据集中，PEaRL在基因和通路水平表达预测上均优于现有方法，Pearson相关系数分别提高达58.9%和20.4%。

Conclusion: 基于通路的转录组表示能产生更忠实于生物学且可解释的多模态模型，推动计算病理学超越基因水平嵌入。

Abstract: Integrating histopathology with spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides a
powerful opportunity to link tissue morphology with molecular function. Yet
most existing multimodal approaches rely on a small set of highly variable
genes, which limits predictive scope and overlooks the coordinated biological
programs that shape tissue phenotypes. We present PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced
Representation Learning), a multimodal framework that represents
transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA. By
encoding biologically coherent pathway signals with a transformer and aligning
them with histology features via contrastive learning, PEaRL reduces
dimensionality, improves interpretability, and strengthens cross-modal
correspondence. Across three cancer ST datasets (breast, skin, and lymph node),
PEaRL consistently outperforms SOTA methods, yielding higher accuracy for both
gene- and pathway-level expression prediction (up to 58.9 percent and 20.4
percent increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to SOTA). These
results demonstrate that grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways
produces more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models,
advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings.

Abstract: Deep learning for medical imaging is hampered by task-specific models that
lack generalizability and prognostic capabilities, while existing 'universal'
approaches suffer from simplistic conditioning and poor medical semantic
understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce DuPLUS, a deep
learning framework for efficient multi-modal medical image analysis. DuPLUS
introduces a novel vision-language framework that leverages hierarchical
semantic prompts for fine-grained control over the analysis task, a capability
absent in prior universal models. To enable extensibility to other medical
tasks, it includes a hierarchical, text-controlled architecture driven by a
unique dual-prompt mechanism. For segmentation, DuPLUS is able to generalize
across three imaging modalities, ten different anatomically various medical
datasets, encompassing more than 30 organs and tumor types. It outperforms the
state-of-the-art task specific and universal models on 8 out of 10 datasets. We
demonstrate extensibility of its text-controlled architecture by seamless
integration of electronic health record (EHR) data for prognosis prediction,
and on a head and neck cancer dataset, DuPLUS achieved a Concordance Index (CI)
of 0.69. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables rapid adaptation to new tasks
and modalities from varying centers, establishing DuPLUS as a versatile and
clinically relevant solution for medical image analysis. The code for this work

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了实时动物检测分割的计算效率问题，并提供了包含4万张标注图像的Houbara数据集支持模型训练评估。

Abstract: Real-time animal detection and segmentation in natural environments are vital
for wildlife conservation, enabling non-invasive monitoring through remote
camera streams. However, these tasks remain challenging due to limited
computational resources and the cryptic appearance of many species. We propose
a mobile-optimized two-stage deep learning framework that integrates a
Threading Detection Model (TDM) to parallelize YOLOv10-based detection and
MobileSAM-based segmentation. Unlike prior YOLO+SAM pipelines, our approach
improves real-time performance by reducing latency through threading. YOLOv10
handles detection while MobileSAM performs lightweight segmentation, both
executed concurrently for efficient resource use. On the cryptic Houbara
Bustard, a conservation-priority species, our model achieves mAP50 of 0.9627,
mAP75 of 0.7731, mAP95 of 0.7178, and a MobileSAM mIoU of 0.7421. YOLOv10
operates at 43.7 ms per frame, confirming real-time readiness. We introduce a
curated Houbara dataset of 40,000 annotated images to support model training
and evaluation across diverse conditions. The code and dataset used in this

TL;DR: Platonic Transformer通过引入柏拉图多面体对称群的参考框架，在保持标准Transformer架构和计算成本的同时，实现了对连续平移和柏拉图对称性的等变性，并在多个基准测试中表现出竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer缺乏对几何对称性的归纳偏置，而现有的等变方法往往通过复杂设计牺牲了Transformer的效率和灵活性。

Method: 通过定义相对于柏拉图多面体对称群参考框架的注意力机制，引入原则性的权重共享方案，实现连续平移和柏拉图对称性的等变性。

Result: 在计算机视觉（CIFAR-10）、3D点云（ScanObjectNN）和分子性质预测（QM9、OMol25）等多个基准测试中取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Platonic Transformer能够在无需额外成本的情况下利用几何约束，为Transformer提供了几何对称性的归纳偏置，同时保持了其原有的效率和灵活性。

Abstract: While widespread, Transformers lack inductive biases for geometric symmetries
common in science and computer vision. Existing equivariant methods often
sacrifice the efficiency and flexibility that make Transformers so effective
through complex, computationally intensive designs. We introduce the Platonic
Transformer to resolve this trade-off. By defining attention relative to
reference frames from the Platonic solid symmetry groups, our method induces a
principled weight-sharing scheme. This enables combined equivariance to
continuous translations and Platonic symmetries, while preserving the exact
architecture and computational cost of a standard Transformer. Furthermore, we
show that this attention is formally equivalent to a dynamic group convolution,
which reveals that the model learns adaptive geometric filters and enables a
highly scalable, linear-time convolutional variant. Across diverse benchmarks
in computer vision (CIFAR-10), 3D point clouds (ScanObjectNN), and molecular
property prediction (QM9, OMol25), the Platonic Transformer achieves
competitive performance by leveraging these geometric constraints at no
additional cost.

Abstract: The generalization of deep neural networks to unknown domains is a major
challenge despite their tremendous progress in recent years. For this reason,
the dynamic area of domain generalization (DG) has emerged. In contrast to
unsupervised domain adaptation, there is no access to or knowledge about the
target domains, and DG methods aim to generalize across multiple different
unseen target domains. Domain generalization is particularly relevant for the
task semantic segmentation which is used in several areas such as biomedicine
or automated driving. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
rapidly evolving topic of domain generalized semantic segmentation. We cluster
and review existing approaches and identify the paradigm shift towards
foundation-model-based domain generalization. Finally, we provide an extensive
performance comparison of all approaches, which highlights the significant
influence of foundation models on domain generalization. This survey seeks to
advance domain generalization research and inspire scientists to explore new

Abstract: Endoscopic procedures such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and
colonoscopy play a critical role in diagnosing and managing gastrointestinal
(GI) disorders. However, the documentation burden associated with these
procedures place significant strain on gastroenterologists, contributing to
inefficiencies in clinical workflows and physician burnout. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel automated report generation model that leverages
a transformer-based vision encoder and text decoder within a two-stage training
framework. In the first stage, both components are pre-trained on image/text
caption pairs to capture generalized vision-language features, followed by
fine-tuning on images/report pairs to generate clinically meaningful findings.
Our approach not only streamlines the documentation process but also holds
promise for reducing physician workload and improving patient care.

Abstract: We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D
hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone
navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to
map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model
that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth

the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set
of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data
by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and
use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D
sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label
872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the
SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate
SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and
show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled
data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to
correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests,
SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen
high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task
completion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对AI视频会议系统中身份劫持攻击的防御方法，通过从姿态-表情潜在空间中提取生物特征信息来检测非法身份交换，无需分析重建的RGB视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI视频会议系统通过传输紧凑的姿态-表情潜在空间来减少带宽，但攻击者可以操纵这些潜在向量实时劫持受害者身份。由于每帧都是合成的，传统的深度伪造检测器无法工作。

Method: 使用姿态条件化的大间隔对比编码器，从传输的潜在空间中分离出持久的身份线索，同时消除瞬时的姿态和表情信息。通过简单的余弦测试检测非法身份交换。

Result: 在多个说话头生成模型上的实验表明，该方法始终优于现有的劫持防御方法，能够实时运行，并在分布外场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了无需查看重建RGB视频的生物特征泄漏防御，有效解决了AI视频会议系统中的身份劫持安全问题。

Abstract: AI-based talking-head videoconferencing systems reduce bandwidth by sending a
compact pose-expression latent and re-synthesizing RGB at the receiver, but
this latent can be puppeteered, letting an attacker hijack a victim's likeness
in real time. Because every frame is synthetic, deepfake and synthetic video
detectors fail outright. To address this security problem, we exploit a key
observation: the pose-expression latent inherently contains biometric
information of the driving identity. Therefore, we introduce the first
biometric leakage defense without ever looking at the reconstructed RGB video:
a pose-conditioned, large-margin contrastive encoder that isolates persistent
identity cues inside the transmitted latent while cancelling transient pose and
expression. A simple cosine test on this disentangled embedding flags illicit
identity swaps as the video is rendered. Our experiments on multiple
talking-head generation models show that our method consistently outperforms
existing puppeteering defenses, operates in real-time, and shows strong
generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

*Junbao Zhou,Yuan Zhou,Kesen Zhao,Qingshan Xu,Beier Zhu,Richang Hong,Hanwang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REVEL提出了一种新的流式拖拽导向交互视频编辑任务，允许用户通过精细拖拽操作随时修改生成视频。DragStream方法通过自适应分布自校正和空间频率选择性优化机制，解决了潜在空间漂移和上下文干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视频扩散模型难以实现流式、精细控制，无法确保输出始终符合用户预期。需要一种能够支持任意时间、任意内容精细拖拽交互的视频编辑方法。

Method: 提出DragStream训练免费方法：1）自适应分布自校正策略，利用相邻帧统计约束潜在嵌入漂移；2）空间频率选择性优化机制，选择性传播视觉线索以充分利用上下文信息同时减少干扰。

Result: DragStream可以无缝集成到现有自回归视频扩散模型中，大量实验证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: REVEL任务和DragStream方法成功解决了流式拖拽视频编辑中的潜在空间漂移和上下文干扰问题，实现了对生成视频的精细交互控制。

Abstract: Achieving streaming, fine-grained control over the outputs of autoregressive
video diffusion models remains challenging, making it difficult to ensure that
they consistently align with user expectations. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{stReaming drag-oriEnted interactiVe vidEo manipuLation (REVEL)}, a new
task that enables users to modify generated videos \emph{anytime} on
\emph{anything} via fine-grained, interactive drag. Beyond DragVideo and
SG-I2V, REVEL unifies drag-style video manipulation as editing and animating
video frames with both supporting user-specified translation, deformation, and
rotation effects, making drag operations versatile. In resolving REVEL, we
observe: \emph{i}) drag-induced perturbations accumulate in latent space,
causing severe latent distribution drift that halts the drag process;
\emph{ii}) streaming drag is easily disturbed by context frames, thereby
yielding visually unnatural outcomes. We thus propose a training-free approach,
\textbf{DragStream}, comprising: \emph{i}) an adaptive distribution
self-rectification strategy that leverages neighboring frames' statistics to
effectively constrain the drift of latent embeddings; \emph{ii}) a
spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism, allowing the model to fully
exploit contextual information while mitigating its interference via
selectively propagating visual cues along generation. Our method can be
seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, and
extensive experiments firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our DragStream.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAS-MIL是一种灵活的集成框架，能够无缝整合多个基础模型的特征，无需手动特征选择或大量任务特定微调，在多个癌症数据集上表现优于或等同于单个基础模型和现有MIL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型为计算病理学提供了强大的通用特征提取器，但为特定诊断任务调整和基准测试单个基础模型通常耗时且资源密集，特别是考虑到其规模和多样性。

Method: 提出Group-Aggregative Selection Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL)框架，通过集成多个基础模型的特征，保留它们的互补优势，避免手动特征选择和大量任务特定微调。

Result: 在前列腺癌(PANDA)、卵巢癌(UBC-OCEAN)和乳腺癌(TCGA-BrCa)三个癌症数据集的分类任务中，GAS-MIL始终实现优于或等同于单个基础模型和已建立MIL方法的性能。

Conclusion: GAS-MIL通过实现异构基础模型的高效集成，简化了病理学模型部署，并为未来多模态和精准肿瘤学应用提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed computational pathology by providing
powerful, general-purpose feature extractors. However, adapting and
benchmarking individual FMs for specific diagnostic tasks is often
time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially given their scale and
diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce Group-Aggregative Selection
Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL), a flexible ensemble framework that
seamlessly integrates features from multiple FMs, preserving their
complementary strengths without requiring manual feature selection or extensive
task-specific fine-tuning. Across classification tasks in three cancer
datasets-prostate (PANDA), ovarian (UBC-OCEAN), and breast (TCGA-BrCa)-GAS-MIL
consistently achieves superior or on-par performance relative to individual FMs
and established MIL methods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
By enabling efficient integration of heterogeneous FMs, GAS-MIL streamlines
model deployment for pathology and provides a scalable foundation for future
multimodal and precision oncology applications.

Motivation: 无人机快速递送纳洛酮为应对阿片类药物过量紧急情况提供了有前景的解决方案，但需要解决旁观者情境感知评估的关键研究空白，以支持有效的人机协作。

Method: 利用DANDSD数据集，提出基于图嵌入和Transformer模型的视频实时SA评估框架，整合几何、运动学和交互图特征等视觉感知和理解线索。

Result: 该方法实现了高性能的SA预测，在时间分割准确性上优于FINCH基线9%的帧平均准确率和5%的交并比。

Conclusion: 这项工作支持开发能够有效指导旁观者的自适应无人机系统，最终改善紧急响应结果并挽救生命。

Abstract: Rapid naloxone delivery via drones offers a promising solution for responding
to opioid overdose emergencies (OOEs), by extending lifesaving interventions to
medically untrained bystanders before emergency medical services (EMS) arrive.
Recognizing the critical role of bystander situational awareness (SA) in
human-autonomy teaming (HAT), we address a key research gap in real-time SA
assessment by introducing the Drone-Assisted Naloxone Delivery Simulation
Dataset (DANDSD). This pioneering dataset captures HAT during simulated OOEs,
where college students without medical training act as bystanders tasked with
administering intranasal naloxone to a mock overdose victim. Leveraging this
dataset, we propose a video-based real-time SA assessment framework that
utilizes graph embeddings and transformer models to assess bystander SA in real
time. Our approach integrates visual perception and comprehension cues--such as
geometric, kinematic, and interaction graph features--and achieves
high-performance SA prediction. It also demonstrates strong temporal
segmentation accuracy, outperforming the FINCH baseline by 9% in Mean over
Frames (MoF) and 5% in Intersection over Union (IoU). This work supports the
development of adaptive drone systems capable of guiding bystanders
effectively, ultimately improving emergency response outcomes and saving lives.

*Mayimunah Nagayi,Alice Khan,Tamryn Frank,Rina Swart,Clement Nyirenda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估四种开源OCR系统（Tesseract、EasyOCR、PaddleOCR、TrOCR）在食品包装图像上的性能，重点关注成分表和营养信息提取的准确性和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 包装上的准确OCR对于合规性和营养监测很重要，但由于多语言文本、密集布局、不同字体、反光和曲面等挑战而困难。

Method: 使用231个产品（1,628张图像）的数据集处理所有四种模型，评估速度和覆盖率，并创建113张图像（60个产品）的真实子集进行准确性评估。

Result: 在真实子集上，Tesseract实现了最低的字符错误率（0.912）和最高的BLEU分数（0.245）。EasyOCR在准确性和多语言支持之间提供了良好平衡。PaddleOCR实现了接近完整的覆盖率但速度较慢，TrOCR尽管有GPU加速但结果最弱。

Conclusion: 这些结果为包装特定场景提供了基准，建立了基线，并突出了布局感知方法和文本定位的发展方向。

Abstract: This study evaluates four open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
systems which are Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and TrOCR on real world food
packaging images. The aim is to assess their ability to extract ingredient
lists and nutrition facts panels. Accurate OCR for packaging is important for
compliance and nutrition monitoring but is challenging due to multilingual
text, dense layouts, varied fonts, glare, and curved surfaces. A dataset of 231
products (1,628 images) was processed by all four models to assess speed and
coverage, and a ground truth subset of 113 images (60 products) was created for
accuracy evaluation. Metrics include Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error
Rate (WER), BLEU, ROUGE-L, F1, coverage, and execution time. On the ground
truth subset, Tesseract achieved the lowest CER (0.912) and the highest BLEU
(0.245). EasyOCR provided a good balance between accuracy and multilingual
support. PaddleOCR achieved near complete coverage but was slower because it
ran on CPU only due to GPU incompatibility, and TrOCR produced the weakest
results despite GPU acceleration. These results provide a packaging-specific
benchmark, establish a baseline, and highlight directions for layout-aware
methods and text localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameOracle是一个轻量级即插即用模块，通过预测最相关帧和所需帧数来优化视频理解中的帧采样策略，在保持准确性的同时显著减少输入帧数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频语言模型受限于处理帧数，传统均匀采样或固定预算采样策略无法适应信息密度和任务复杂度的变化，导致效率低下和信息丢失。

Method: 采用四阶段课程学习训练，前三阶段使用跨模态相似度等弱代理信号，最后阶段利用新构建的FrameOracle-41K数据集提供的关键帧标注进行强监督训练。

Result: 在5个VLM和6个基准测试中，FrameOracle将16帧输入平均减少到10.4帧且准确率无损失；从64帧候选帧开始，平均减少到13.9帧同时准确率提升1.4%。

Conclusion: FrameOracle实现了可扩展视频理解中最优的效率-准确性权衡，为视频语言模型提供了高效的帧采样解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced video understanding, but their
performance is limited by the number of input frames they can process. Existing
frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, often
fail to adapt to variations in information density or task complexity,
resulting in inefficiency and information loss. To address this, we present
FrameOracle, a lightweight and plug-and-play module that predicts both (1)
which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are
needed. FrameOracle is trained using a four-stage curriculum, with the first
three stages relying on weak proxy signals such as cross-modal similarity. In
the final stage, it leverages stronger supervision from a new dataset we
introduce, FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA collection to provide
keyframe annotations specifying the minimal set of frames required to answer
each question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks
demonstrate that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4
frames without any loss in accuracy. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it
reduces the input to an average of 13.9 frames while improving accuracy by
1.4%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable
video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出混合协同微调(CFT)方法，结合标记和未标记数据来改进游戏视觉bug检测，减少对目标游戏标记数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动识别游戏视觉bug成本高且需要专业知识，监督模型依赖大量标记数据，但视觉bug出现频率低导致数据稀缺。

Method: 采用混合协同微调方法，整合目标游戏标记数据、协同领域游戏标记数据和未标记数据，增强特征表示学习。

Result: 实验结果显示CFT方法在多种游戏环境中优于传统基线方法，即使仅使用50%目标游戏标记数据仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: CFT框架提高了游戏视觉bug检测的可扩展性和适应性，有效利用所有可用数据，显著减少对特定目标游戏标记数据的依赖。

Abstract: Manual identification of visual bugs in video games is a resource-intensive
and costly process, often demanding specialized domain knowledge. While
supervised visual bug detection models offer a promising solution, their
reliance on extensive labeled datasets presents a significant challenge due to
the infrequent occurrence of such bugs. To overcome this limitation, we propose
a hybrid Co-FineTuning (CFT) method that effectively integrates both labeled
and unlabeled data. Our approach leverages labeled samples from the target game
and diverse co-domain games, additionally incorporating unlabeled data to
enhance feature representation learning. This strategy maximizes the utility of
all available data, substantially reducing the dependency on labeled examples
from the specific target game. The developed framework demonstrates enhanced
scalability and adaptability, facilitating efficient visual bug detection
across various game titles. Our experimental results show the robustness of the
proposed method for game visual bug detection, exhibiting superior performance
compared to conventional baselines across multiple gaming environments.
Furthermore, CFT maintains competitive performance even when trained with only
50% of the labeled data from the target game.

### [36] [Exploring the Hierarchical Reasoning Model for Small Natural-Image Classification Without Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03598)
*Alexander V. Mantzaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRM模型在MNIST上表现良好（约98%测试准确率），但在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上过拟合严重，性能远不如简单的CNN基线模型，表明当前HRM在小分辨率图像分类任务中缺乏足够的图像特定归纳偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究HRM模型是否可以作为实用的图像分类器，特别是在没有数据增强的原始训练机制下。

Method: 使用包含两个Transformer风格模块(f_L,f_H)的HRM模型，采用一步训练(DEQ风格)、深度监督、旋转位置嵌入和RMSNorm，在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上评估，训练机制严格限制：无数据增强、相同优化器家族、一周期预热后余弦衰减、标签平滑。

Result: HRM在MNIST上达到约98%测试准确率，但在CIFAR-10上仅65.0%（CNN基线77.2%），CIFAR-100上仅29.7%（CNN基线45.3%），且训练速度比CNN慢约30倍。损失曲线显示优化健康但过拟合严重。

Conclusion: 在当前形式下，HRM在小分辨率图像分类任务中无法与简单的卷积架构竞争，主要原因是缺乏足够的图像特定归纳偏置，但模型修改可能带来显著改进。

Abstract: This paper asks whether the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with the two
Transformer-style modules $(f_L,f_H)$, one step (DEQ-style) training, deep
supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm can serve as a practical
image classifier. It is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under a
deliberately raw regime: no data augmentation, identical optimizer family with
one-epoch warmup then cosine-floor decay, and label smoothing. HRM optimizes
stably and performs well on MNIST ($\approx 98\%$ test accuracy), but on small
natural images it overfits and generalizes poorly: on CIFAR-10, HRM reaches
65.0\% after 25 epochs, whereas a two-stage Conv--BN--ReLU baseline attains
77.2\% while training $\sim 30\times$ faster per epoch; on CIFAR-100, HRM
achieves only 29.7\% test accuracy despite 91.5\% train accuracy, while the
same CNN reaches 45.3\% test with 50.5\% train accuracy. Loss traces and error
analyses indicate healthy optimization but insufficient image-specific
inductive bias for HRM in this regime. It is concluded that, for
small-resolution image classification without augmentation, HRM is not
competitive with even simple convolutional architectures as the HRM currently
exist but this does not exclude possibilities that modifications to the model
may allow it to improve greatly.

Conclusion: 讨论了DINOv2的局限性、影响以及未来的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have made it possible to
learn general-purpose visual features that capture both the high-level
semantics and the fine-grained spatial structure of images. Most notably, the
recent DINOv2 has established a new state of the art by surpassing weakly
supervised methods (WSL) like OpenCLIP on most benchmarks. In this survey, we
examine the core ideas behind its approach, multi-crop view augmentation and
self-distillation with a mean teacher, and trace their development in previous
work. We then compare the performance of DINO and DINOv2 with other SSL and WSL
methods across various downstream tasks, and highlight some remarkable emergent
properties of their learned features with transformer backbones. We conclude by
briefly discussing DINOv2's limitations, its impact, and future research
directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FSCIL中由于数据稀缺导致的泛化能力不足问题，传统方法依赖有限数据集，而直接使用扩散模型可能产生语义不对齐或无效指导。

Method: 提出DCS框架，建立扩散模型与分类器的相互促进循环，采用奖励对齐学习策略，通过特征级和logits级的多层面奖励函数指导扩散模型生成图像。

Conclusion: DCS框架通过扩散模型与分类器的协同进化，有效解决了FSCIL中的数据稀缺和泛化问题，为小样本增量学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially
learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a
task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current
FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on
limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation,
their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective
guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel
framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and
FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a
dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state
directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the
feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored
maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits
level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class
discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session
confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated
images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better
reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL
benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class
learning.

Abstract: Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and
underground mining, are frequently caused by unsafe worker behaviors.
Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and
insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent
need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present
MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety
violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces
three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000
vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining
regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a
clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant
clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and
(3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve
fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in
precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM
significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving
improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score
over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further
integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation
reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of
multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and
beyond.

Abstract: The integration of Diffusion Models into Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) is a substantial improvement in the detection of accidents. We present a
novel hybrid model integrating guidance classification with diffusion
techniques. By leveraging fine-tuned ExceptionNet architecture outputs as input
for our proposed diffusion model and processing image tensors as our
conditioning, our approach creates a robust classification framework. Our model
consists of multiple conditional modules, which aim to modulate the linear
projection of inputs using time embeddings and image covariate embeddings,
allowing the network to adapt its behavior dynamically throughout the diffusion
process. To address the computationally intensive nature of diffusion models,
our implementation is cloud-based, enabling scalable and efficient processing.
Our strategy overcomes the shortcomings of conventional classification
approaches by leveraging diffusion models inherent capacity to effectively
understand complicated data distributions. We investigate important diffusion
characteristics, such as timestep schedulers, timestep encoding techniques,
timestep count, and architectural design changes, using a thorough ablation
study, and have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model
against the baseline models on a publicly available dataset. The proposed
diffusion model performs best in image-based accident detection with an
accuracy of 97.32%.

Conclusion: SAMSOD模型通过解决模态不平衡收敛和梯度差异问题，在多个RGB-T和RGB-D任务上取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: RGB-T salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment attractive objects by
combining RGB and thermal infrared images. To enhance performance, the Segment
Anything Model has been fine-tuned for this task. However, the imbalance
convergence of two modalities and significant gradient difference between high-
and low- activations are ignored, thereby leaving room for further performance
enhancement. In this paper, we propose a model called \textit{SAMSOD}, which
utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance the learning of non-dominant modality
and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting
gradients on model convergence. The method also leverages two decoupled
adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言学习在指代表达理解任务上取得了显著进展，但在自动驾驶等实际应用中，定位极小的目标仍然是一个重大挑战

Method: 1) 构建包含10万对指代表达和边界框的SOREC数据集；2) 提出渐进迭代缩放适配器PIZA，通过参数高效微调使模型能够逐步放大并定位小目标

Result: 将PIZA应用于GroundingDINO模型后，在SOREC数据集上准确率显著提升

Conclusion: 提出的SOREC数据集和PIZA方法有效解决了小目标指代表达理解的挑战，相关资源已公开

Abstract: Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to localize the target object
described by a natural language expression. Recent advances in vision-language
learning have led to significant performance improvements in REC tasks.
However, localizing extremely small objects remains a considerable challenge
despite its importance in real-world applications such as autonomous driving.
To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset and method for REC
targeting small objects. First, we present the small object REC (SOREC)
dataset, which consists of 100,000 pairs of referring expressions and
corresponding bounding boxes for small objects in driving scenarios. Second, we
propose the progressive-iterative zooming adapter (PIZA), an adapter module for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enables models to progressively zoom in
and localize small objects. In a series of experiments, we apply PIZA to
GroundingDINO and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy on the
SOREC dataset. Our dataset, codes and pre-trained models are publicly available
on the project page.

Conclusion: 基于注意力机制的Attention-WNet模型在视网膜血管动静脉分割任务中表现出色，为视网膜血管分析提供了一种有效的深度学习方法。

Abstract: Segmenting of clinically important retinal blood vessels into arteries and
veins is a prerequisite for retinal vessel analysis. Such analysis can provide
potential insights and bio-markers for identifying and diagnosing various
retinal eye diseases. Alteration in the regularity and width of the retinal
blood vessels can act as an indicator of the health of the vasculature system
all over the body. It can help identify patients at high risk of developing
vasculature diseases like stroke and myocardial infarction. Over the years,
various Deep Learning architectures have been proposed to perform retinal
vessel segmentation. Recently, attention mechanisms have been increasingly used
in image segmentation tasks. The work proposes a new Deep Learning approach for
artery-vein segmentation. The new approach is based on the Attention mechanism
that is incorporated into the WNet Deep Learning model, and we call the model
as Attention-WNet. The proposed approach has been tested on publicly available
datasets such as HRF and DRIVE datasets. The proposed approach has outperformed
other state-of-art models available in the literature.

Motivation: 解决大规模多模态数据集缺乏人口统计标注的问题，以理解训练数据在产生模型偏见中的作用。

Method: 通过结合目标检测、多模态字幕生成和微调分类器的验证自动标注流程，为LAION-400M数据集创建人物中心标注，包括边界框、感知性别和种族/民族标签。

Result: 发现数据集中存在人口统计不平衡和有害关联，如男性和被感知为黑人或中东裔的个体与犯罪相关和负面内容的不成比例关联。

Conclusion: 建立了数据集组成与下游模型偏见之间的大规模经验联系，证明训练数据中的直接共现可以解释大部分模型偏见。

Abstract: Vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets show strong
demographic biases, but the role of training data in producing these biases
remains unclear. A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations
in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating
person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million
bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically
generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic
labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and
finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and
harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and
individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and
negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable
Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our
resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset
composition and downstream model bias.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法尚未充分利用预训练神经网络的潜力，需要探索在贫民窟检测任务中，任务特异性预训练与大数据量预训练哪种策略更有效。

Method: 使用两种预训练神经网络：1）在大型通用图像数据集上预训练的通用网络；2）在卫星图像上预训练的专用网络，比较它们在里约热内卢贫民窟检测任务中的性能。

Result: 研究结果表明，在贫民窟检测任务中，任务特异性预训练与大数据量预训练的相对优势需要进一步实验验证。

Conclusion: 该研究为选择预训练策略提供了重要参考，有助于优化贫民窟检测模型的性能。

Abstract: While deep learning methods for detecting informal settlements have already
been developed, they have not yet fully utilized the potential offered by
recent pretrained neural networks. We compare two types of pretrained neural
networks for detecting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro: 1. Generic networks
pretrained on large diverse datasets of unspecific images, 2. A specialized
network pretrained on satellite imagery. While the latter is more specific to
the target task, the former has been pretrained on significantly more images.
Hence, this research investigates whether task specificity or data volume
yields superior performance in urban informal settlement detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LoRA Patching的新方法，通过向Deepfake生成器注入可插拔的LoRA补丁来绕过现有的主动防御系统，同时展示了该方法也能用于防御目的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Deepfake主动防御系统存在鲁棒性和可靠性不足的问题，需要揭示这些防御策略的弱点并开发更强大的对抗方法。

Method: 使用低秩适应(LoRA)补丁技术，结合可学习的门控机制防止梯度爆炸，并引入多模态特征对齐(MMFA)损失函数来在语义层面对齐特征。

Result: 仅使用1,000个面部样本和单个训练周期，LoRA补丁就能成功绕过多种先进的主动防御系统。

Conclusion: 当前Deepfake防御范式存在严重漏洞，需要开发更鲁棒的防御策略，同时提出的LoRA补丁方法既可用于攻击也可用于防御。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant societal risks, motivating the development of
proactive defenses that embed adversarial perturbations in facial images to
prevent manipulation. However, in this paper, we show that these preemptive
defenses often lack robustness and reliability. We propose a novel approach,
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching, which injects a plug-and-play LoRA patch
into Deepfake generators to bypass state-of-the-art defenses. A learnable
gating mechanism adaptively controls the effect of the LoRA patch and prevents
gradient explosions during fine-tuning. We also introduce a Multi-Modal Feature
Alignment (MMFA) loss, encouraging the features of adversarial outputs to align
with those of the desired outputs at the semantic level. Beyond bypassing, we
present defensive LoRA patching, embedding visible warnings in the outputs as a
complementary solution to mitigate this newly identified security
vulnerability. With only 1,000 facial examples and a single epoch of
fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses.
These results reveal a critical weakness in current paradigms and underscore
the need for more robust Deepfake defense strategies. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Reference-Set-Finetuning (RSF)方法，通过在测试时参考集上进行微调，提升视觉位置识别在挑战性数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VPR方法在训练-测试域差异大的挑战性基准上表现不佳，而测试时参考集包含目标域信息，可作为补充信息源来弥合域差距。

Method: 在测试时参考集上进行简单微调，利用地图中的图像和姿态信息提升模型在目标域的性能。

Result: 在挑战性数据集上平均提升Recall@1约2.3%，且微调后的模型保持泛化能力，在不同测试数据集上均有效。

Conclusion: RSF是一种简单有效的补充方法，能显著提升SOTA VPR方法在域差异大的挑战性基准上的性能。

Abstract: Given a query image, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is the task of retrieving
an image of the same place from a reference database with robustness to
viewpoint and appearance changes. Recent works show that some VPR benchmarks
are solved by methods using Vision-Foundation-Model backbones and trained on
large-scale and diverse VPR-specific datasets. Several benchmarks remain
challenging, particularly when the test environments differ significantly from
the usual VPR training datasets. We propose a complementary, unexplored source
of information to bridge the train-test domain gap, which can further improve
the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) VPR methods on such challenging
benchmarks. Concretely, we identify that the test-time reference set, the
"map", contains images and poses of the target domain, and must be available
before the test-time query is received in several VPR applications. Therefore,
we propose to perform simple Reference-Set-Finetuning (RSF) of VPR models on
the map, boosting the SOTA (~2.3% increase on average for Recall@1) on these
challenging datasets. Finetuned models retain generalization, and RSF works
across diverse test datasets.

*Jiaxin Deng,Junbiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARSAM通过自适应采样-重用-混合分解梯度的方法，在保持SAM泛化能力的同时显著加速训练，速度提升约40%且性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM虽然能提升模型泛化能力，但计算成本是SGD的两倍，需要寻找更高效的优化方法。

Method: 将SAM梯度分解为SGD梯度和二阶梯度在一阶梯度上的投影(PSF)，通过自适应重用PSF和及时更新PSF来加速训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100等数据集上，ARSAM达到与SAM相当的准确率，速度提升约40%，并在姿态估计、模型量化等挑战性任务中有效加速。

Conclusion: ARSAM是一种高效且通用的优化方法，能在不牺牲性能的情况下显著加速SAM训练过程。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization but doubles
the computational cost of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by requiring twice
the gradient calculations per optimization step. To mitigate this, we propose
Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients to significantly
accelerate SAM (ARSAM). Concretely, we firstly discover that SAM's gradient can
be decomposed into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order
gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). Furthermore, we observe that the
SGD gradient and PSF dynamically evolve during training, emphasizing the
growing role of the PSF to achieve a flat minima. Therefore, ARSAM is proposed
to the reused PSF and the timely updated PSF still maintain the model's
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ARSAM achieves
state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM across diverse network
architectures. On CIFAR-10/100, ARSAM is comparable to SAM while providing a
speedup of about 40\%. Moreover, ARSAM accelerates optimization for the various
challenge tasks (\textit{e.g.}, human pose estimation, and model quantization)
without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.% The

Motivation: 解决概念瓶颈模型在概念捕获能力方面的挑战，特别是仅依赖最终层特征而忽略浅层和多尺度特征，以及缺乏概念编码有效指导的问题。

Method: 提出概念提示和聚合框架，包括概念感知嵌入生成器从各层提取概念表示，以及概念提示调优利用这些表示作为提示来增强关键概念线索。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，CoPA优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CoPA框架能有效捕获和利用图像中的概念信息，显著提升概念和疾病预测性能。

Abstract: The transparency of deep learning models is essential for clinical
diagnostics. Concept Bottleneck Model provides clear decision-making processes
for diagnosis by transforming the latent space of black-box models into
human-understandable concepts. However, concept-based methods still face
challenges in concept capture capabilities. These methods often rely on encode
features solely from the final layer, neglecting shallow and multiscale
features, and lack effective guidance in concept encoding, hindering
fine-grained concept extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Concept
Prompting and Aggregating (CoPA), a novel framework designed to capture
multilayer concepts under prompt guidance. This framework utilizes the
Concept-aware Embedding Generator (CEG) to extract concept representations from
each layer of the visual encoder. Simultaneously, these representations serve
as prompts for Concept Prompt Tuning (CPT), steering the model towards
amplifying critical concept-related visual cues. Visual representations from
each layer are aggregated to align with textual concept representations. With
the proposed method, valuable concept-wise information in the images is
captured and utilized effectively, thus improving the performance of concept
and disease prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CoPA
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/yihengd/CoPA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D医学影像数据集规模日益增大且复杂，阻碍了协作研究和可移植性，需要找到既能压缩数据又不影响自动分割性能的方法。

Method: 在包含真实血管分割标签的大规模3D医学数据集上，应用ZFP压缩技术的误差容忍和固定速率两种模式，并与未压缩基准进行严格比较。

Result: ZFP实现了高达22.89:1的数据压缩比，同时保持了高保真度，平均Dice系数保持在0.87656（基准为0.8774）。

Conclusion: ZFP是一种可行且强大的工具，能够实现大规模医学数据集的高效和可访问性研究，促进更广泛的社区协作。

Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of medical imaging datasets, particularly
in 3D formats, present significant barriers to collaborative research and
transferability. This study investigates whether the ZFP compression technique
can mitigate these challenges without compromising the performance of automated
cerebrovascular segmentation, a critical first step in intracranial aneurysm
detection. We apply ZFP in both its error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a
large scale, and one of the most recent, datasets in the literature, 3D medical
dataset containing ground-truth vascular segmentations. The segmentation
quality on the compressed volumes is rigorously compared to the uncompressed
baseline (Dice approximately equals 0.8774). Our findings reveal that ZFP can
achieve substantial data reduction--up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance
mode--while maintaining a high degree of fidelity, with the mean Dice
coefficient remaining high at 0.87656. These results demonstrate that ZFP is a
viable and powerful tool for enabling more efficient and accessible research on
large-scale medical datasets, fostering broader collaboration across the
community.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown near-expert performance in
segmenting complex medical tissues and tumors. However, existing models are
often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical
regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging,
particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are
critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation
architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs,
Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture
local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN
decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual
consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by
emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both
encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale
communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and
generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By
effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a
practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code
and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support
reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Urban safety and infrastructure maintenance are critical components of smart
city development. Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly
costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for
automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with
polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ
polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop
a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly
collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based
model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve
78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong
performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score)
classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class
imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for
monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无配对图像翻译任务缺乏对齐样本，扩散模型能生成高质量多样化输出，对比学习能学习语义相似性而无需显式监督，两者结合可有效解决无配对I2I问题。

Method: 使用时间相关对比学习，通过SimCLR将图像与其域不变特征作为正样本对进行训练，学习到的对比模型指导预训练SDE进行图像翻译推理。

Result: 在三个常见无配对I2I任务上与多个基线方法比较，Contrastive-SDE在多个指标上达到与最先进方法相当的结果，且收敛更快、无需标签监督或分类器训练。

Conclusion: Contrastive-SDE是一种更高效的无配对图像翻译方法，结合了扩散模型和对比学习的优势，在保持性能的同时显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation involves learning mappings between source
domain and target domain in the absence of aligned or corresponding samples.
Score based diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
generative tasks. Their ability to approximate complex data distributions
through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) enables them to generate
high-fidelity and diverse outputs, making them particularly well-suited for
unpaired I2I settings. In parallel, contrastive learning provides a powerful
framework for learning semantic similarities without the need for explicit
supervision or paired data. By pulling together representations of semantically
similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, contrastive methods are
inherently aligned with the objectives of unpaired translation. Its ability to
selectively enforce semantic consistency at the feature level makes contrastive
learning particularly effective for guiding generation in unpaired scenarios.
In this work, we propose a time-dependent contrastive learning approach where a
model is trained with SimCLR by considering an image and its domain invarient
feature as a positive pair, enabling the preservation of domain-invariant
features and the discarding of domain-specific ones. The learned contrastive
model then guides the inference of a pretrained SDE for the I2I translation
task. We empirically compare Contrastive-SDE with several baselines across
three common unpaired I2I tasks, using four metrics for evaluation.
Constrastive-SDE achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art on several
metrics. Furthermore, we observe that our model converges significantly faster
and requires no label supervision or classifier training, making it a more
efficient alternative for this task.

TL;DR: LIBERO-PRO是一个扩展的VLA模型基准测试，通过系统性的扰动评估揭示现有模型在标准测试中90%的准确率在广义设置下崩溃至0%，暴露了模型依赖记忆而非真正理解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LIBERO基准测试的训练和评估设置存在问题，导致性能估计被夸大，无法公平比较模型。需要更严格的评估方法来测试模型的泛化能力和真实理解。

Method: 引入LIBERO-PRO基准，在四个维度上系统评估模型性能：操纵对象、初始状态、任务指令和环境，通过合理的扰动来测试模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有模型在标准LIBERO评估中达到90%以上准确率，但在广义设置下性能崩溃至0.0%，表明模型依赖训练集中的动作序列和环境布局记忆。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法存在严重缺陷，呼吁社区放弃误导性方法，采用能够评估模型泛化能力和理解的鲁棒评估方法。

Abstract: LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and
evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance
estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we
introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically
evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four
dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and
environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models
achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their
performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this
discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action
sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine
task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in
executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant
items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted
instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in
current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon
misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization
and comprehension. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 当前图像生成模型生成的合成图像越来越难以被标准AI检测器识别，但人类仍能区分。为了识别这种差异，需要研究新的检测方法。

Method: 构建Mirage数据集，包含具有可见伪影的多样化AI生成图像。研究大型视觉语言模型在AI图像检测中的应用，并在Mirage和现有基准数据集上进行实验。

Result: 大型视觉语言模型在检测具有可见伪影的AI生成图像方面非常有效，但在面对缺乏此类线索的图像时性能下降。

Conclusion: 大型视觉语言模型可用于可解释的AI图像检测，特别是在存在可见伪影的情况下，但对无伪影图像的检测能力有限。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models have led to models that produce
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult for standard AI detectors to
identify, even though they often remain distinguishable by humans. To identify
this discrepancy, we introduce \textbf{Mirage}, a curated dataset comprising a
diverse range of AI-generated images exhibiting visible artifacts, where
current state-of-the-art detection methods largely fail. Furthermore, we
investigate whether Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are
increasingly employed as substitutes for human judgment in various tasks, can
be leveraged for explainable AI image detection. Our experiments on both Mirage
and existing benchmark datasets demonstrate that while LVLMs are highly
effective at detecting AI-generated images with visible artifacts, their
performance declines when confronted with images lacking such cues.

Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法存在两个主要问题：(1)依赖固定的最后一层隐藏层，导致误差逐层累积；(2)使用<SEG>作为提示，缺乏明确的空间线索。

Method: 提出了Policy-Prompted Masking方法，包含两个关键组件：随机跳跃连接(SSC)和Mask as Prompt(MasP)。SSC通过强化学习策略动态选择连接层，MasP使用相似度图作为软逻辑掩码来提示SAM生成掩码。

Result: UGround首次在单一框架内统一了从传统指代表达到推理分割、从单目标到多目标、从正查询到错误前提的视觉定位任务。

Conclusion: UGround通过动态层选择和明确的掩码提示，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为视觉定位提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: We present UGround, a \textbf{U}nified visual \textbf{Ground}ing paradigm
that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \textbf{U}nrolled
transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that
leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\texttt{<SEG>} as prompt''. UGround
addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its
reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies
cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate
correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly
projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues
(\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which
comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as
Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic
sampling, allows each \texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer
layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision
model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer,
MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{<SEG>} token and image
tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering
explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the
effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding
within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from
traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning
segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise
(empty target). All codes and models are publicly available at

TL;DR: OMG4是一个优化4D高斯溅射的框架，通过三阶段渐进式剪枝和压缩技术，显著减少模型存储需求超过60%，同时保持重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D高斯溅射虽然能实时渲染动态场景，但需要数百万个高斯函数，存储开销巨大。现有压缩方法在压缩比或视觉质量方面仍有局限。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进式剪枝：高斯采样识别关键基元、高斯剪枝去除冗余、高斯合并融合相似基元；结合隐式外观压缩和广义子向量量化技术。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上的实验表明，OMG4显著优于现有方法，模型大小减少超过60%的同时保持重建质量。

Conclusion: OMG4为紧凑4D场景表示迈出了重要一步，为广泛应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene
representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions.
However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of
Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies
have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in
compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized
Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of
salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our
method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to
identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning
to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with
similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance
compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations,
further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms
recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while
maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a
significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new
possibilities for a wide range of applications. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的开放词汇目标检测框架，通过结构化域对齐将地面视图的预训练模型知识迁移到航拍图像领域，解决了跨域知识转移的挑战。


<details>

Motivation: 传统目标检测模型在固定类别集上训练，缺乏灵活性且扩展新类别成本高。开放词汇目标检测能识别未见类别，但地面视图预训练模型直接应用于航拍图像时，由于域偏移、视角变化和尺度差异等问题效果不佳。

Method: 采用结构化域对齐策略：对比性图像到图像对齐增强航拍与地面视图嵌入的相似性；多实例词汇关联对齐航拍图像与文本嵌入。

Result: 在xView、DOTAv2、VisDrone、DIOR和HRRSD数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。在零样本设置下，相比微调的封闭词汇模型，在DOTAv2上提升+6.32 mAP，VisDrone上+4.16 mAP，HRRSD上+3.46 mAP。

Conclusion: 该方法为航拍应用中的目标检测系统提供了更灵活和可扩展的解决方案，成功实现了从地面视图到航拍图像的开放词汇知识迁移。

Abstract: Traditional object detection models are typically trained on a fixed set of
classes, limiting their flexibility and making it costly to incorporate new
categories. Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by
enabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training.
Leveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available
ground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for
open-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint
variations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across
domains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for adapting open-vocabulary
representations from ground-view images to solve object detection in aerial
imagery through structured domain alignment. The method introduces contrastive
image-to-image alignment to enhance the similarity between aerial and
ground-view embeddings and employs multi-instance vocabulary associations to
align aerial images with text embeddings. Extensive experiments on the xView,
DOTAv2, VisDrone, DIOR, and HRRSD datasets are used to validate our approach.
Our open-vocabulary model achieves improvements of +6.32 mAP on DOTAv2, +4.16
mAP on VisDrone (Images), and +3.46 mAP on HRRSD in the zero-shot setting when
compared to finetuned closed-vocabulary dataset-specific model performance,
thus paving the way for more flexible and scalable object detection systems in
aerial applications.

Conclusion: SDAKD方法有效解决了GAN知识蒸馏中的容量不匹配问题，在超分辨率任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) achieve excellent performance in
generative tasks, such as image super-resolution, but their computational
requirements make difficult their deployment on resource-constrained devices.
While knowledge distillation is a promising research direction for GAN
compression, effectively training a smaller student generator is challenging
due to the capacity mismatch between the student generator and the teacher
discriminator. In this work, we propose Student Discriminator Assisted
Knowledge Distillation (SDAKD), a novel GAN distillation methodology that
introduces a student discriminator to mitigate this capacity mismatch. SDAKD
follows a three-stage training strategy, and integrates an adapted feature map
distillation approach in its last two training stages. We evaluated SDAKD on
two well-performing super-resolution GANs, GCFSR and Real-ESRGAN. Our
experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over the baselines and SOTA GAN
knowledge distillation methods. The SDAKD source code will be made openly

Abstract: Diagnosing ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) requires a
comprehensive analysis of both head pose and ocular movements. However,
existing datasets focus on these aspects separately, limiting the development
of integrated diagnostic approaches and restricting AI-driven advancements in
AHP analysis. To address this gap, we introduce PoseGaze-AHP, a novel 3D
dataset that synchronously captures head pose and gaze movement information for
ocular-induced AHP assessment. Structured clinical data were extracted from
medical literature using large language models (LLMs) through an iterative
process with the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, combining stepwise, hierarchical, and
complex prompting strategies. The extracted records were systematically imputed
and transformed into 3D representations using the Neural Head Avatar (NHA)
framework. The dataset includes 7,920 images generated from two head textures,
covering a broad spectrum of ocular conditions. The extraction method achieved
an overall accuracy of 91.92%, demonstrating its reliability for clinical
dataset construction. PoseGaze-AHP is the first publicly available resource
tailored for AI-driven ocular-induced AHP diagnosis, supporting the development
of accurate and privacy-compliant diagnostic tools.

Conclusion: DHQA-4D数据集和DynaMesh-Rater方法为动态4D数字人网格的质量评估提供了有效解决方案，能够准确评估纹理和非纹理4D网格的质量。

Abstract: With the rapid development of 3D scanning and reconstruction technologies,
dynamic digital human avatars based on 4D meshes have become increasingly
popular. A high-precision dynamic digital human avatar can be applied to
various fields such as game production, animation generation, and remote
immersive communication. However, these 4D human avatar meshes are prone to
being degraded by various types of noise during the processes of collection,
compression, and transmission, thereby affecting the viewing experience of
users. In light of this fact, quality assessment of dynamic 4D digital humans
becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we first propose a large-scale
dynamic digital human quality assessment dataset, DHQA-4D, which contains 32
high-quality real-scanned 4D human mesh sequences, 1920 distorted textured 4D
human meshes degraded by 11 textured distortions, as well as their
corresponding textured and non-textured mean opinion scores (MOSs). Equipped
with DHQA-4D dataset, we analyze the influence of different types of distortion
on human perception for textured dynamic 4D meshes and non-textured dynamic 4D
meshes. Additionally, we propose DynaMesh-Rater, a novel large multimodal model
(LMM) based approach that is able to assess both textured 4D meshes and
non-textured 4D meshes. Concretely, DynaMesh-Rater elaborately extracts
multi-dimensional features, including visual features from a projected 2D
video, motion features from cropped video clips, and geometry features from the
4D human mesh to provide comprehensive quality-related information. Then we
utilize a LMM model to integrate the multi-dimensional features and conduct a
LoRA-based instruction tuning technique to teach the LMM model to predict the
quality scores. Extensive experimental results on the DHQA-4D dataset
demonstrate the superiority of our DynaMesh-Rater method over previous quality
assessment methods.

Conclusion: 该方法为计算机辅助皮肤癌诊断提供了更有效和高效的解决方案，增强了特征学习能力。

Abstract: Skin cancer classification remains a challenging problem due to high
inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and image noise in dermoscopic
images. To address these issues, we propose an improved ResNet-50 model
enhanced with Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF), which adaptively
integrates multi-scale semantic and surface features to improve feature
representation and reduce overfitting. The ResNet-50 model is enhanced with an
adaptive feature fusion mechanism to achieve more effective multi-scale feature
extraction and improve overall performance. Specifically, a dual-branch design
fuses high-level semantic and mid-level detail features, which are processed
through global average pooling and fully connected layers to generate adaptive
weights for weighted fusion, thereby strengthening feature learning and
reducing the impact of noise on classification. The method is evaluated on a
subset of the ISIC 2020 dataset containing 3297 benign and malignant skin
lesion images. Experimental results show that the proposed ASFF-based ResNet-50
achieves the best overall performance compared with 5 classic convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) models. The proposed model reached an accuracy of 93.18%
along with higher precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. The improved
model achieves an AUC value of 0.9670 and 0.9717 in the P-R and ROC curve,
respectively. Then, the evaluation based on Grad-CAM further proved that the
improved model adaptively focuses on lesion-relevant regions while suppressing
irrelevant background information, thereby validating its enhanced feature
learning capability from a deep representation perspective. These findings
demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a more effective and efficient
solution for computer-aided skin cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Aims Late diagnosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) contributes
significantly to its high global mortality rate, with over 50\% of cases
detected at advanced stages and a 5-year survival rate below 50\% according to
WHO statistics. This study aims to improve early detection of OSCC by
developing a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates clinical,
radiological, and histopathological images using a weighted ensemble of
DenseNet-121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Material and Methods A
retrospective study was conducted using publicly available datasets
representing three distinct medical imaging modalities. Each modality-specific
dataset was used to train a DenseNet-121 CNN via transfer learning.
Augmentation and modality-specific preprocessing were applied to increase
robustness. Predictions were fused using a validation-weighted ensemble
strategy. Evaluation was performed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Results High validation accuracy was achieved for radiological (100\%) and
histopathological (95.12\%) modalities, with clinical images performing lower
(63.10\%) due to visual heterogeneity. The ensemble model demonstrated improved
diagnostic robustness with an overall accuracy of 84.58\% on a multimodal
validation dataset of 55 samples. Conclusion The multimodal ensemble framework
bridges gaps in the current diagnostic workflow by offering a non-invasive,
AI-assisted triage tool that enhances early identification of high-risk
lesions. It supports clinicians in decision-making, aligning with global
oncology guidelines to reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), explainable image quality assessment (IQA) has
gradually become popular, aiming at providing quality-related descriptions and
answers of images. To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a
large-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality
perception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large
amount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and
redundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model.
To cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and
systematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning
dataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first
investigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different
sizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data
set randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than
training with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the
redundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data. Beyond randomly
sampling a subset, we propose a clustering-based data selection framework with
three stages: clustering feature extraction, cluster quota allocation, and
cluster sampling strategy. Then we systematically analyze the choices of each
stage and propose a simple but efficient data selection method IQA-Select for
explainable IQA. The experimental results demonstrate that IQA-Select can
achieve 102.1% and 103.7% performance of full fine-tuning using only 10%
selected data in Q-Bench and AesBench respectively, significantly reducing
computational costs while achieving better performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可泛化动作专家的框架，使用稀疏3D轨迹作为中间表示，将VLM的高级规划能力与低级物理动作模块连接起来，解决了传统VLA模型泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Vision-Language-Action模型将推理和动作集成在单一架构中，由于受限于稀缺的窄领域数据而泛化能力差。双系统方法虽然尝试解耦"思考"和"行动"，但受到动作模块语义模糊性的限制，难以进行大规模跨任务训练。

Method: 使用稀疏3D轨迹作为中间表示，VLM只需生成粗略的3D路径点，然后由可泛化动作专家通过采样实时点云观测将其细化为密集可执行动作序列。采用"动作预训练，点云微调"的新范式。

Result: 该方法结合了VLM在视觉理解和规划方面的广泛泛化能力与动作专家在细粒度动作级别的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了VLA模型在物理世界部署中的泛化问题，通过解耦规划和执行，实现了更好的跨环境适应性和训练效率。

Abstract: Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning
and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world
introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture,
generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data.
While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from
"acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action
module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible.
Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly
collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation
mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these
limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a
generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an
intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning
capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the
planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These
waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines
them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud
observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust
generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud
Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization
capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the
fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.

intervention technique. We also address a key limitation in existing datasets
by developing more comprehensive and precise class description benchmarks. We
validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimentation

conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details
critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from
handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image
fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and
segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving
questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical
study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical
filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants
(filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven
visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images.
Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance
on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals
when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how
VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate
qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment
with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these
results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods
and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves
autonomous perception in adverse weather.

TL;DR: CAMEO是一个用于通用人体运动视频生成的分层框架，通过连接文本到运动模型和条件视频扩散模型，解决了训练和推理过程中的次优因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视频扩散模型快速发展，但在通用人体视频生成方面仍未被充分探索，大多数工作局限于图像到视频设置或舞蹈视频等狭窄领域。

Method: 设计了一个分层框架，精心准备文本提示和视觉条件来有效训练视频扩散模型，并引入相机感知条件模块自动选择与输入文本对齐的视角。

Result: 在MovieGen基准和新设计的基准上验证了方法的有效性，展示了在不同用例中的多功能性。

Conclusion: CAMEO框架成功弥合了文本到运动模型和条件视频扩散模型之间的差距，提高了生成视频的连贯性并减少了人工干预。

Abstract: Human video generation is becoming an increasingly important task with broad
applications in graphics, entertainment, and embodied AI. Despite the rapid
progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human
video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to
image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we
propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation.
It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs,
mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both
training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we
analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively
train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions,
conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a
camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically
selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and
reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the
T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use
cases.

TL;DR: OpenFLAME是一个联邦化的视觉定位系统后端，允许独立组织分别3D扫描和管理自己的空间，解决集中式VPS在隐私、监管和维护方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式视觉定位系统无法覆盖私人室内空间，存在隐私担忧、监管限制和维护瓶颈。需要分布式解决方案来扩大覆盖范围并保护数据隐私。

Method: 提出联邦化图像定位概念，采用分布式VPS服务架构，各组织维护独立的3D扫描和VPS服务，通过参考解决方案管理和合并跨地图数据而不共享私有数据。

Result: 实现了分布式VPS后端，支持室内空间的访问控制、分布式维护和更大覆盖范围，解决了服务分片带来的定位结果一致性、质量控制和服务选择等挑战。

Conclusion: 联邦化VPS方法能够有效解决集中式系统的局限性，为大规模AR应用提供更广泛、更隐私保护的定位服务。

Abstract: World-scale augmented reality (AR) applications need a ubiquitous 6DoF
localization backend to anchor content to the real world consistently across
devices. Large organizations such as Google and Niantic are 3D scanning outdoor
public spaces in order to build their own Visual Positioning Systems (VPS).
These centralized VPS solutions fail to meet the needs of many future AR
applications -- they do not cover private indoor spaces because of privacy
concerns, regulations, and the labor bottleneck of updating and maintaining 3D
scans. In this paper, we present OpenFLAME, a federated VPS backend that allows
independent organizations to 3D scan and maintain a separate VPS service for
their own spaces. This enables access control of indoor 3D scans, distributed
maintenance of the VPS backend, and encourages larger coverage. Sharding of VPS
services introduces several unique challenges -- coherency of localization
results across spaces, quality control of VPS services, selection of the right
VPS service for a location, and many others. We introduce the concept of
federated image-based localization and provide reference solutions for managing
and merging data across maps without sharing private data.

Motivation: 现有系统虽然能准确分类网球击球动作，但缺乏将生物力学洞察转化为对球员和教练有意义的可操作语言反馈。

Method: 使用CNN-LSTM模型从运动数据中提取关键生物力学特征（关节角度、肢体速度、动力链模式），分析这些特征与击球效果和受伤风险的关系，然后利用大语言模型生成反馈。

Result: 基于THETIS数据集和特征提取技术，该方法能够产生技术上准确、生物力学基础扎实且对最终用户可操作的反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架在分类性能和可解释性方面进行了评估，弥合了可解释AI与运动生物力学之间的差距。

Abstract: Automated tennis stroke analysis has advanced significantly with the
integration of biomechanical motion cues alongside deep learning techniques,
enhancing stroke classification accuracy and player performance evaluation.
Despite these advancements, existing systems often fail to connect
biomechanical insights with actionable language feedback that is both
accessible and meaningful to players and coaches. This research project
addresses this gap by developing a novel framework that extracts key
biomechanical features (such as joint angles, limb velocities, and kinetic
chain patterns) from motion data using Convolutional Neural Network Long
Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM)-based models. These features are analyzed for
relationships influencing stroke effectiveness and injury risk, forming the
basis for feedback generation using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging
the THETIS dataset and feature extraction techniques, our approach aims to
produce feedback that is technically accurate, biomechanically grounded, and
actionable for end-users. The experimental setup evaluates this framework on
classification performance and interpretability, bridging the gap between
explainable AI and sports biomechanics.

TL;DR: TimeWarp方法通过创建针对性合成时间数据集，显著提升了视频大语言模型在细粒度时间理解任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在一般视频理解任务上表现良好，但在需要细粒度时间理解的任务上表现不佳，主要因为缺乏视觉复杂性和时间细微差别的数据集，导致模型过度依赖语言推理而非真正理解视频动态。

Method: 提出TimeWarp方法，系统性地创建针对性合成时间数据集来微调模型，使其更关注输入视频内容。构建了一个大规模偏好数据集，捕捉常被忽视的复杂时间动态，将模型响应锚定在视觉和时间信息上。

Result: 应用该方法后，在时间理解基准测试上性能显著提升，在七个基准测试中均取得绝对性能改进。

Conclusion: TimeWarp方法通过创建针对性时间数据集，有效提升了视频大语言模型的时间理解能力，证明了所提数据集在推进视频大语言模型时间理解方面的有效性。

Abstract: While Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across general video understanding benchmarks-particularly in video
captioning and descriptive tasks-they consistently underperform on tasks that
require fine-grained temporal understanding. This limitation arises due to the
lack of visual complexity and temporal nuance in current fine-tuning datasets,
leading these models to rely heavily on language-based reasoning rather than
truly understanding video dynamics. In this work, we propose TimeWarp, a
systematic method to create a targeted synthetic temporal dataset to fine-tune
the model's responses to encourage it to focus on the given input video. We
introduce a large-scale preference dataset, created using TimeWarp, that
captures intricate temporal dynamics often overlooked, grounding the model's
responses to visual and temporal information. We demonstrate that when our
method is applied to existing models, it significantly improves performance on
temporal understanding benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our
proposed datasets in advancing temporal understanding in Video-LLMs, resulting
in an absolute improvement in performance across seven benchmarks. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在生物医学视觉语言模型中扩展文本编码器上下文长度的影响，发现更长的上下文能带来更好的检索和分类性能，并提出了BIOMEDICA-LongCAP数据集和BMC-LongCLIP模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型通常使用短文本窗口（<77个token）进行预训练，这导致长格式的生物医学描述被截断。然而，大规模开源文献中的生物医学描述有很大部分远超77个token，因此需要研究长上下文预训练的影响。

Method: 扩展视觉语言模型中文本编码器的上下文长度，创建了BIOMEDICA-LongCAP数据集（包含100万张图像-描述对，具有来自全文文章的上下文感知描述），并训练了BMC-LongCLIP模型，支持最多512个token的文本窗口。

Result: BMC-LongCLIP将上下文容量扩展了6.6倍，token浪费率从55%降至2.2%。在长描述检索基准测试中，Recall@1获得了高达30%的绝对增益，分类任务平均提升2%，且收敛速度比短上下文模型更快。

Conclusion: 长上下文建模是推进生物医学视觉语言模型发展的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short
text windows (<77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions.
Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source
literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To
this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical
captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that
longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format
captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance.
Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M
image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text
articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using
BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a
text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context
capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption
retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in
Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging
faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling
is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出CPG框架，通过可控伪标签生成解决未知分布的无标签数据在长尾半监督学习中的挑战，实现模型性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长尾半监督学习方法假设无标签数据遵循预定义分布，但实际上无标签数据分布未知且可能任意，这限制了方法性能。

Method: 采用可控自增强优化循环：动态可控过滤机制选择可靠伪标签，构建贝叶斯最优分类器，并辅以类感知自适应增强模块和辅助分支。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上取得一致改进，准确率最高提升15.97%，超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: CPG框架能有效处理未知分布的无标签数据，通过可控伪标签生成显著提升长尾半监督学习性能。

Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data
exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical
predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed).
However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may
follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled
dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the
unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a
known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution.
Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization
cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism
selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into
the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known
distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit
adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved
classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next
training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can
significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions.
Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further
improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to
maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples.
Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that
CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up
to \textbf{15.97\%} in accuracy. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OCR系统在处理越南历史文献中的古典汉喃文字时，难以应对图像退化、非标准字形和手写变体等问题，阻碍了文献数字化和跨语言语义研究。

Method: 使用精选的越南古典汉喃手稿数据集，对PaddleOCRv5的文本识别模块进行微调，构建完整的训练流程包括预处理、LMDB转换、评估和可视化。

Result: 微调后模型在汉喃文字识别任务上准确率从37.5%显著提升至50.0%，在噪声图像条件下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了古典汉喃文字的识别性能，并开发了交互式演示工具，支持汉越语义对齐、机器翻译和历史语言学研究等下游应用。

Abstract: Recognizing and processing Classical Chinese (Han-Nom) texts play a vital
role in digitizing Vietnamese historical documents and enabling cross-lingual
semantic research. However, existing OCR systems struggle with degraded scans,
non-standard glyphs, and handwriting variations common in ancient sources. In
this work, we propose a fine-tuning approach for PaddleOCRv5 to improve
character recognition on Han-Nom texts. We retrain the text recognition module
using a curated subset of ancient Vietnamese Chinese manuscripts, supported by
a full training pipeline covering preprocessing, LMDB conversion, evaluation,
and visualization. Experimental results show a significant improvement over the
base model, with exact accuracy increasing from 37.5 percent to 50.0 percent,
particularly under noisy image conditions. Furthermore, we develop an
interactive demo that visually compares pre- and post-fine-tuning recognition
results, facilitating downstream applications such as Han-Vietnamese semantic
alignment, machine translation, and historical linguistics research. The demo

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaSeg是一个基于元学习的隐式神经表示框架，用于医学图像分割，通过同时预测像素强度和类别标签，在保持90%参数减少的同时达到与U-Net相当的Dice分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INRs)在信号表示方面表现出色，但不适合分割等预测任务，需要学习信号分布上的语义结构。

Method: 使用底层INR同时预测像素强度值和类别标签，通过元学习过程在训练数据集上找到最优初始参数，使INR能够简单微调以适应未见测试图像并自动解码类别标签。

Result: 在2D和3D脑部MRI分割任务中评估，报告了与常用U-Net模型相当的Dice分数，但参数减少了90%。

Conclusion: MetaSeg为医学图像分割提供了一个新颖、可扩展的替代方案，替代了传统的资源密集型架构如U-Net和视觉变换器。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have achieved remarkable successes in
learning expressive yet compact signal representations. However, they are not
naturally amenable to predictive tasks such as segmentation, where they must
learn semantic structures over a distribution of signals. In this study, we
introduce MetaSeg, a meta-learning framework to train INRs for medical image
segmentation. MetaSeg uses an underlying INR that simultaneously predicts per
pixel intensity values and class labels. It then uses a meta-learning procedure
to find optimal initial parameters for this INR over a training dataset of
images and segmentation maps, such that the INR can simply be fine-tuned to fit
pixels of an unseen test image, and automatically decode its class labels. We
evaluated MetaSeg on 2D and 3D brain MRI segmentation tasks and report Dice
scores comparable to commonly used U-Net models, but with $90\%$ fewer
parameters. MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional
resource-heavy architectures such as U-Nets and vision transformers for medical
image segmentation. Our project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频问答中计算效率低下的问题，传统方法需要处理大量帧导致计算成本高，需要一种能在固定token预算下高效处理长视频的方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用低帧率浏览定位问题相关时间段；2) 通过span感知的token重新分配在更高有效帧率下回答问题，使用交错组相对目标进行端到端训练。

Result: 在固定token预算下，ViTL在长视频QA和时间定位任务上达到最高8.6%的性能提升，同时减少50%的帧输入，span感知的token重新分配始终优于均匀采样。

Conclusion: ViTL和配套数据集提供了一个可解释、计算高效的解决方案，为可扩展的长视频问答提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We present \emph{Video-in-the-Loop} (ViTL), a two-stage long-video QA
framework that preserves a fixed token budget by first \emph{localizing}
question-relevant interval(s) with a low-fps skim and then \emph{answering} via
span-aware reallocation of visual tokens at higher effective frame rate,
emitting an interleaved output with both spans and the final option for direct
attribution. We also introduce \dataname{}, which converts description based
event graphs into \emph{span-grounded} multiple-choice QA by pairing each
question with \emph{ground-truth} time span(s) and related reasoning. ViTL is
trained end-to-end with an interleaved group-relative objective that couples
temporal IoU for localization with answer correctness, allowing credit to flow
from answers back to spans without increasing compute. Under fixed token
budgets, ViTL attains up to 8.6% with 50% less frame input on long-video QA and
temporal grounding (e.g., Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions) and ablations
show that span-aware token reallocation consistently surpasses uniform
sampling. Together, \dataname{} and ViTL provide an interpretable,
compute-efficient recipe for scalable long-video QA.

Motivation: 现有假新闻视频检测器由于训练数据有限且多样性不足，导致模式偏见和性能受限。真实场景中视频素材与伪造新闻事件存在复杂的多对多关系，但现有数据集未能充分反映这种关系。

Method: AgentAug框架实现多个基于LLM的四种伪造类别管道来创建新闻视频，结合基于不确定性采样的主动学习策略选择有用的增强样本。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，AgentAug持续提升了短视频假新闻检测器的性能。

Conclusion: AgentAug通过模拟假新闻创作过程和主动学习策略，有效解决了训练数据不足和多样性缺乏的问题，提高了假新闻视频检测的准确性。

Abstract: The emergence of fake news on short video platforms has become a new
significant societal concern, necessitating automatic video-news-specific
detection. Current detectors primarily rely on pattern-based features to
separate fake news videos from real ones. However, limited and less diversified
training data lead to biased patterns and hinder their performance. This
weakness stems from the complex many-to-many relationships between video
material segments and fabricated news events in real-world scenarios: a single
video clip can be utilized in multiple ways to create different fake
narratives, while a single fabricated event often combines multiple distinct
video segments. However, existing datasets do not adequately reflect such
relationships due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating large-scale
real-world data, resulting in sparse coverage and non-comprehensive learning of
the characteristics of potential fake news video creation. To address this
issue, we propose a data augmentation framework, AgentAug, that generates
diverse fake news videos by simulating typical creative processes. AgentAug
implements multiple LLM-driven pipelines of four fabrication categories for
news video creation, combined with an active learning strategy based on
uncertainty sampling to select the potentially useful augmented samples during
training. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AgentAug consistently improves the performance of short video fake news
detectors.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing have shifted from manual pixel manipulation
to employing deep learning methods like stable diffusion models, which now
leverage cross-attention mechanisms for text-driven control. This transition
has simplified the editing process but also introduced variability in results,
such as inconsistent hair color changes. Our research aims to enhance the
precision and reliability of prompt-to-prompt image editing frameworks by
exploring and optimizing hyperparameters. We present a comprehensive study of
the "word swap" method, develop an "attention re-weight method" for better
adaptability, and propose the "CL P2P" framework to address existing
limitations like cycle inconsistency. This work contributes to understanding
and improving the interaction between hyperparameter settings and the
architectural choices of neural network models, specifically their attention

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro基准测试中，仅用18.5K训练样本就达到52.8%的准确率，超越了V2P-7B（50.6%，9.6M样本）和GTA-1-7B（50.1%，1.56M样本）。

Conclusion: GUI-Spotlight通过迭代聚焦方法显著提高了视觉定位精度，为多模态大语言模型在图形用户界面系统中的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have markedly expanded the
competence of graphical user-interface (GUI) systems, propelling them beyond
controlled simulations into complex, real-world environments across diverse
platforms. However, practical usefulness is still bounded by the reliability of
visual grounding, i.e., mapping textual references to exact on-screen elements.
This limitation prevents the system from accurately performing pointer-level
actions such as clicking or dragging. To address it, we introduce GUI-Spotlight
-- a model trained for image-grounded reasoning that dynamically invokes
multiple specialized tools to iteratively narrow its focus to the relevant
region of the screen, thereby substantially improving visual grounding
accuracy. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Spotlight trained with only
18.5K training samples achieves 52.8\% accuracy, surpassing V2P-7B (50.6\% with
9.6M training samples) and GTA-1-7B (50.1\% with 1.56M training samples).

Abstract: Post-training quantization for reducing the storage of deep neural network
models has been demonstrated to be an effective way in various tasks. However,
low-bit quantization while maintaining model accuracy is a challenging problem.
In this paper, we present a range estimation method to improve the quantization
performance for post-training quantization. We model the range estimation into
an optimization problem of minimizing quantization errors by layer-wise local
minima. We prove this problem is locally convex and present an efficient search
algorithm to find the optimal solution. We propose the application of the above
search algorithm to the transformed weights space to do further improvement in
practice. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art performance generally on top-1 accuracy for image
classification tasks on the ResNet series models and Inception-v3 model. The
experimental results show that the proposed method has almost no loss of top-1
accuracy in 8-bit and 6-bit settings for image classifications, and the
accuracy of 4-bit quantization is also significantly improved. The code is

Method: 提出灵活的检索机制，支持文本、图像和3D模态的任意组合查询，通过联合建模对象级特征（包括外观）和场景级布局结构来增强空间推理和风格一致性。引入即插即用的等变布局编码器ESSGNN来捕捉空间关系和对象外观特征。

Result: 实证评估表明，MetaFind在各种检索任务中相比基线方法具有改进的空间和风格一致性。

Conclusion: MetaFind通过三模态组合检索框架有效提升了3D资产检索的空间和风格一致性，支持迭代式场景构建，为元宇宙场景生成提供了更可靠的资产检索解决方案。

Abstract: We present MetaFind, a scene-aware tri-modal compositional retrieval
framework designed to enhance scene generation in the metaverse by retrieving
3D assets from large-scale repositories. MetaFind addresses two core
challenges: (i) inconsistent asset retrieval that overlooks spatial, semantic,
and stylistic constraints, and (ii) the absence of a standardized retrieval
paradigm specifically tailored for 3D asset retrieval, as existing approaches
mainly rely on general-purpose 3D shape representation models. Our key
innovation is a flexible retrieval mechanism that supports arbitrary
combinations of text, image, and 3D modalities as queries, enhancing spatial
reasoning and style consistency by jointly modeling object-level features
(including appearance) and scene-level layout structures. Methodologically,
MetaFind introduces a plug-and-play equivariant layout encoder ESSGNN that
captures spatial relationships and object appearance features, ensuring
retrieved 3D assets are contextually and stylistically coherent with the
existing scene, regardless of coordinate frame transformations. The framework
supports iterative scene construction by continuously adapting retrieval
results to current scene updates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the
improved spatial and stylistic consistency of MetaFind in various retrieval
tasks compared to baseline methods.

Result: 该方法通过利用数据的序数特性来增强模型学习过程，旨在提高整体预测性能。

Conclusion: 整合序数信息的损失函数能够更好地处理耀斑预测中的序数关系，有望改善模型在预测阈值附近的分类准确性。

Abstract: The prediction of solar flares is typically formulated as a binary
classification task, distinguishing events as either Flare (FL) or No-Flare
(NF) according to a specified threshold (for example, greater than or equal to
C-class, M-class, or X-class). However, this binary framework neglects the
inherent ordinal relationships among the sub-classes contained within each
category (FL and NF). Several studies on solar flare prediction have
empirically shown that the most frequent misclassifications occur near this
prediction threshold. This suggests that the models struggle to differentiate
events that are similar in intensity but fall on opposite sides of the binary
threshold. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a modified loss function
that integrates the ordinal information among the sub-classes of the binarized
flare labels into the conventional binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This
approach serves as an ordinality-aware, data-driven regularization method that
penalizes the incorrect predictions of flare events in close proximity to the
prediction threshold more heavily than those away from the boundary during
model optimization. By incorporating ordinal weighting into the loss function,
we aim to enhance the model's learning process by leveraging the ordinal
characteristics of the data, thereby improving its overall performance.

Motivation: 现有深度学习去摩尔纹方法需要大量计算资源，难以在边缘设备部署。直接应用现有量化方法会导致严重性能下降，主要原因是分布异常值和平滑区域表示弱化。

Method: 1. 异常值感知量化器：使用基于采样的范围估计减少激活异常值，保留少量极端权重为FP16；2. 频率感知校准策略：在微调过程中强调低中频分量，减轻低比特量化引起的带状伪影。

Result: QuantDemoire在W4A4配置下比现有量化方法性能提升超过4dB，同时大幅减少参数和计算量。

Conclusion: 该框架为去摩尔纹任务提供了高效的量化解决方案，在保持图像质量的同时显著降低了计算需求，适合边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Demoir\'eing aims to remove moir\'e artifacts that often occur in images.
While recent deep learning-based methods have achieved promising results, they
typically require substantial computational resources, limiting their
deployment on edge devices. Model quantization offers a compelling solution.
However, directly applying existing quantization methods to demoir\'eing models
introduces severe performance degradation. The main reasons are distribution
outliers and weakened representations in smooth regions. To address these
issues, we propose QuantDemoire, a post-training quantization framework
tailored to demoir\'eing. It contains two key components. **First}, we
introduce an outlier-aware quantizer to reduce errors from outliers. It uses
sampling-based range estimation to reduce activation outliers, and keeps a few
extreme weights in FP16 with negligible cost. **Second**, we design a
frequency-aware calibration strategy. It emphasizes low- and mid-frequency
components during fine-tuning, which mitigates banding artifacts caused by
low-bit quantization. Extensive experiments validate that our QuantDemoire
achieves large reductions in parameters and computation while maintaining
quality. Meanwhile, it outperforms existing quantization methods by over **4
dB** on W4A4. Code is released at:

TL;DR: TV-LoRA是一种结合扩散生成先验和多正则化约束的低剂量稀疏视图CT重建方法，在ADMM框架下实现高效3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极稀疏视图下CT重建的病态问题和纹理丢失问题，结合生成先验和物理约束来提升重建质量。

Method: 结合扩散生成先验(NCSN++ SDE模型)和TV、核范数(LoRA)多正则化约束，采用ADMM框架，使用2D切片策略和FFT加速、张量并行优化。

Result: 在AAPM-2016、CTHD和LIDC数据集上，TV-LoRA在SSIM、纹理恢复、边缘清晰度和伪影抑制方面均优于基准方法，展现强鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 扩散模型+TV-LoRA实现了高保真、高效的3D CT重建，在低剂量稀疏采样场景下具有广泛的临床应用前景。

Abstract: This work presents TV-LoRA, a novel method for low-dose sparse-view CT
reconstruction that combines a diffusion generative prior (NCSN++ with SDE
modeling) and multi-regularization constraints, including anisotropic TV and
nuclear norm (LoRA), within an ADMM framework. To address ill-posedness and
texture loss under extremely sparse views, TV-LoRA integrates generative and
physical constraints, and utilizes a 2D slice-based strategy with FFT
acceleration and tensor-parallel optimization for efficient inference.
Experiments on AAPM-2016, CTHD, and LIDC datasets with
$N_{\mathrm{view}}=8,4,2$ show that TV-LoRA consistently surpasses benchmarks
in SSIM, texture recovery, edge clarity, and artifact suppression,
demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability. Ablation studies confirm
the complementary effects of LoRA regularization and diffusion priors, while
the FFT-PCG module provides a speedup. Overall, Diffusion + TV-LoRA achieves
high-fidelity, efficient 3D CT reconstruction and broad clinical applicability
in low-dose, sparse-sampling scenarios.

Method: 1) 将拓扑一致性形式化为拓扑图的基本属性，使用定位精度作为替代指标；2) 提出数据集模糊度的量化方法；3) 构建具有校准模糊度的多样化基准数据集，并实现深度学习基线系统。

Result: 实验和分析揭示了当前方法在感知混淆下的局限性，所有数据集、基线和评估工具都已开源。

Conclusion: 该工作为拓扑映射研究提供了标准化评估框架，促进了该领域的一致性和可复现性研究。

Abstract: Topological mapping offers a compact and robust representation for
navigation, but progress in the field is hindered by the lack of standardized
evaluation metrics, datasets, and protocols. Existing systems are assessed
using different environments and criteria, preventing fair and reproducible
comparisons. Moreover, a key challenge - perceptual aliasing - remains
under-quantified, despite its strong influence on system performance. We
address these gaps by (1) formalizing topological consistency as the
fundamental property of topological maps and showing that localization accuracy
provides an efficient and interpretable surrogate metric, and (2) proposing the
first quantitative measure of dataset ambiguity to enable fair comparisons
across environments. To support this protocol, we curate a diverse benchmark
dataset with calibrated ambiguity levels, implement and release deep-learned
baseline systems, and evaluate them alongside classical methods. Our
experiments and analysis yield new insights into the limitations of current
approaches under perceptual aliasing. All datasets, baselines, and evaluation
tools are fully open-sourced to foster consistent and reproducible research in
topological mapping.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of event-based meshflow estimation, a
novel task that involves predicting a spatially smooth sparse motion field from
event cameras. To start, we review the state-of-the-art in event-based flow
estimation, highlighting two key areas for further research: i) the lack of
meshflow-specific event datasets and methods, and ii) the underexplored
challenge of event data density. First, we generate a large-scale
High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset, which showcases its superiority
by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280x720, handling dynamic
objects and complex motion patterns, and offering both optical flow and
meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works.
Besides, we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network, a
lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to
facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore, we upgrade
EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow, in which a
Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp
motion boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the exceptional
performance and runtime efficiency (30x faster) of our EEMFlow model compared
to the recent state-of-the-art flow method. As an extension, we expand HREM
into HREM+, a multi-density event dataset contributing to a thorough study of
the robustness of existing methods across data with varying densities, and
propose an Adaptive Density Module (ADM) to adjust the density of input event
data to a more optimal range, enhancing the model's generalization ability. We
empirically demonstrate that ADM helps to significantly improve the performance
of EEMFlow and EEMFlow+ by 8% and 10%, respectively. Code and dataset are
released at https://github.com/boomluo02/EEMFlowPlus.

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，通过预训练编码器和采样指导策略，显著提升了6D物体姿态估计的性能和效率。

Abstract: Latest diffusion models have shown promising results in category-level 6D
object pose estimation by modeling the conditional pose distribution with depth
image input. The existing methods, however, suffer from slow convergence during
training, learning its encoder with the diffusion denoising network in
end-to-end fashion, and require an additional network that evaluates sampled
pose hypotheses to filter out low-quality pose candidates. In this paper, we
propose a novel pipeline that tackles these limitations by two key components.
First, the proposed method pretrains the encoder with the direct pose
regression head, and jointly learns the networks via the regression head and
the denoising diffusion head, significantly accelerating training convergence
while achieving higher accuracy. Second, sampling guidance via time-dependent
score scaling is proposed s.t. the exploration-exploitation trade-off is
effectively taken, eliminating the need for the additional evaluation network.
The sampling guidance maintains multi-modal characteristics of symmetric
objects at early denoising steps while ensuring high-quality pose generation at
final steps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including REAL275,
HouseCat6D, and ROPE, demonstrate that the proposed method, simple yet
effective, achieves state-of-the-art accuracies even with single-pose
inference, while being more efficient in both training and inference.

Motivation: 多教师模型蒸馏中存在概念漂移问题，即多个教师的推理轨迹分布会不可预测地演化，并将偏见传递给学生模型，最终损害其性能。

Method: 建立了概念漂移与知识蒸馏的理论联系，提出"学习、比较、批判"范式，通过自主偏好优化(APO)进行概念对齐，让学生模型在教师指导下学习、比较多个教师，并对漂移推理进行批判性反思。

Result: 实验证明该方法在知识蒸馏中具有优越的一致性、鲁棒性和泛化性能，并贡献了包含170,982条蒸馏推理轨迹的大规模数据集CXR-MAX。

Conclusion: 该方法能够产生鲁棒、一致且可泛化的模型，有效解决了多教师蒸馏中的概念漂移问题。

Abstract: This paper identifies a critical yet underexplored challenge in distilling
from multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the reasoning trajectories
generated by multiple drifting teachers exhibit concept drift, whereby their
reasoning distributions evolve unpredictably and transmit biases to the student
model, ultimately compromising its performance. To tackle this issue, we
pioneer a theoretical connection between concept drift and knowledge
distillation, casting the non-stationary reasoning dynamics from multiple MLLM
teachers as next-token prediction of multi-stream reasoning trajectories.Guided
by concept drift, we introduce the "learn, compare, critique" paradigm,
culminating in autonomous preference optimization (APO). Under the active
guidance of the teachers, the student model first learns and self-distils
preferred thinking by comparing multiple teachers. It then engages in critical
reflection over the drifting inference from teachers, performing concept
alignment through APO, ultimately yielding a robust, consistent, and
generalizable model.Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance
of consistency, robustness and generalization within knowledge distillation.
Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset, CXR-MAX (Multi-teachers
Alignment X-rays), comprising 170,982 distilled reasoning trajectories derived
from publicly accessible MLLMs based on MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public

Motivation: 传统建筑安全检查方法效率低下，需要处理大量信息。现有的大语言模型应用存在响应不相关、模态输入受限和幻觉问题，且缺乏实时适应性。

Method: 开发了SiteShield框架，采用多模态LVLM和检索增强生成技术，整合视觉和音频输入来自动化安全检查报告生成。

Result: SiteShield在真实数据上表现优异：F1分数0.82，汉明损失0.04，精确率0.76，召回率0.96，显著优于无RAG的单模态LLM。

Conclusion: SiteShield为增强信息检索和安全报告生成效率提供了一条新途径，证明了多模态RAG框架在建筑安全检查中的有效性。

Abstract: Conventional construction safety inspection methods are often inefficient as
they require navigating through large volume of information. Recent advances in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety
inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However,
existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific
responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of
training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces
SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating
visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed
unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04,
precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield
offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in
generating safety reports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络容易学习训练数据中的虚假相关性，现有方法需要先验偏见知识或偏见冲突样本，这在现实场景中往往不切实际。

Method: 训练生成模型进行跨偏见域图像翻译，保持任务相关特征；基于图像对偏见的敏感性自适应精炼；通过对齐任务相关特征相同但偏见不同的样本，以及错开偏见相同的样本来鼓励鲁棒表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，在损坏CIFAR-10数据集的最差组设置下比最接近的基线方法绝对提升约18%。

Conclusion: BLADE在无需显式监督的情况下建立了偏见缓解的新基准，展示了开发更鲁棒深度学习模型的潜力。

Abstract: Neural networks have revolutionized numerous fields, yet they remain
vulnerable to a critical flaw: the tendency to learn implicit biases, spurious
correlations between certain attributes and target labels in training data.
These biases are often more prevalent and easier to learn, causing models to
rely on superficial patterns rather than task-relevant features necessary for
generalization. Existing methods typically rely on strong assumptions, such as
prior knowledge of these biases or access to bias-conflicting samples, i.e.,
samples that contradict spurious correlations and counterbalance bias-aligned
samples, samples that conform to these spurious correlations. However, such
assumptions are often impractical in real-world settings. We propose BLADE
({B}ias-{L}inked {A}daptive {DE}biasing), a generative debiasing framework that
requires no prior knowledge of bias or bias-conflicting samples. BLADE first
trains a generative model to translate images across bias domains while
preserving task-relevant features. Then, it adaptively refines each image with
its synthetic counterpart based on the image's susceptibility to bias. To
encourage robust representations, BLADE aligns an image with its
bias-translated synthetic counterpart that shares task-relevant features but
differs in bias, while misaligning it with samples sharing the same bias. We
evaluate BLADE on multiple benchmark datasets and show that it significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it exceeds the closest baseline
by an absolute margin of around 18% on the corrupted CIFAR-10 dataset under the
worst group setting, establishing a new benchmark in bias mitigation and
demonstrating its potential for developing more robust deep learning models
without explicit supervision.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在关键应用中缺乏可解释性，现有概念瓶颈模型需要昂贵的概念标注且缺乏空间定位，无法识别支持每个概念的具体区域。

Method: 将概念引导图像分割集成到基于注意力的多实例学习框架中，将每个分割区域视为实例，学习跨区域聚合证据，通过语义区域推理实现概念级解释。

Conclusion: SEG-MIL-CBM通过语义区域推理实现了无需概念标注的鲁棒性能和空间定位的概念级解释，解决了现有模型在可解释性和可靠性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision;
however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and
trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is
crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not
only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading
features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their
explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by
reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly
concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which
regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that
integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple
instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an
instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning
over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our
model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and
produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring
annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance
across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies
between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade
visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent,
concept-level explanations.

Motivation: 扩散变换器的迭代采样过程由于每个时间步都需要进行昂贵的transformer前向传播而成为主要瓶颈，现有缓存方法对所有特征维度采用统一策略，忽略了它们不同的动态行为。

Method: 将隐藏特征演化建模为跨维度的ODE混合，引入HyCa框架应用维度级缓存策略，基于混合ODE求解器思想。

Result: 在FLUX上实现5.55倍加速，HunyuanVideo上5.56倍加速，Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit上6.24倍加速，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: HyCa通过维度级缓存策略有效解决了扩散变换器采样瓶颈，在多个领域和模型上实现了接近无损的显著加速效果。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers offer state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video
synthesis, but their iterative sampling process remains a major bottleneck due
to the high cost of transformer forward passes at each timestep. To mitigate
this, feature caching has emerged as a training-free acceleration technique
that reuses or forecasts hidden representations. However, existing methods
often apply a uniform caching strategy across all feature dimensions, ignoring
their heterogeneous dynamic behaviors. Therefore, we adopt a new perspective by
modeling hidden feature evolution as a mixture of ODEs across dimensions, and
introduce HyCa, a Hybrid ODE solver inspired caching framework that applies
dimension-wise caching strategies. HyCa achieves near-lossless acceleration
across diverse domains and models, including 5.55 times speedup on FLUX, 5.56
times speedup on HunyuanVideo, 6.24 times speedup on Qwen-Image and
Qwen-Image-Edit without retraining.

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models can synthesize high-quality images, their
performance degrades significantly when prompted with novel or
out-of-distribution (OOD) entities due to inherent knowledge cutoffs. We
introduce World-To-Image, a novel framework that bridges this gap by empowering
T2I generation with agent-driven world knowledge. We design an agent that
dynamically searches the web to retrieve images for concepts unknown to the
base model. This information is then used to perform multimodal prompt
optimization, steering powerful generative backbones toward an accurate
synthesis. Critically, our evaluation goes beyond traditional metrics,
utilizing modern assessments like LLMGrader and ImageReward to measure true
semantic fidelity. Our experiments show that World-To-Image substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic alignment and visual
aesthetics, achieving +8.1% improvement in accuracy-to-prompt on our curated
NICE benchmark. Our framework achieves these results with high efficiency in
less than three iterations, paving the way for T2I systems that can better
reflect the ever-changing real world. Our demo code is available

vast, unstructured vocabulary of visual tokens. This conventional approach
treats tokens as a flat vocabulary, disregarding the intrinsic structure of the
token embedding space where proximity often correlates with semantic
similarity. This oversight results in a highly complex prediction task, which
hinders training efficiency and limits final generation quality. To resolve
this, we propose Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC), a principled
framework that constructs a hierarchical semantic tree directly from the
codebook's intrinsic structure. MASC employs a novel geometry-aware distance
metric and a density-driven agglomerative construction to model the underlying
manifold of the token embeddings. By transforming the flat, high-dimensional
prediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a
beneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem
for the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive
experiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57%
and significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL
from 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly
competitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the
prediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable
generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像的快速增长模糊了真实与合成内容的边界，现有视觉语言模型在检测高质量合成图像的细微伪影方面存在不足。

Method: 模仿人类视觉检查，ZoomIn首先扫描图像定位可疑区域，然后对这些放大区域进行聚焦分析。使用MagniFake数据集（20,000张真实和高质量合成图像）进行训练。

Result: 该方法达到96.39%的准确率，具有强大的泛化能力，并提供基于视觉证据的人类可理解解释。

Conclusion: ZoomIn框架在AI生成图像检测方面实现了高准确性和可解释性，为数字完整性提供了有效的取证解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI-generated imagery has blurred the boundary between
real and synthetic content, raising critical concerns for digital integrity.
Vision-language models (VLMs) offer interpretability through explanations but
often fail to detect subtle artifacts in high-quality synthetic images. We
propose ZoomIn, a two-stage forensic framework that improves both accuracy and
interpretability. Mimicking human visual inspection, ZoomIn first scans an
image to locate suspicious regions and then performs a focused analysis on
these zoomed-in areas to deliver a grounded verdict. To support training, we
introduce MagniFake, a dataset of 20,000 real and high-quality synthetic images
annotated with bounding boxes and forensic explanations, generated through an
automated VLM-based pipeline. Our method achieves 96.39% accuracy with robust
generalization, while providing human-understandable explanations grounded in
visual evidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像配准问题，即寻找使两幅图像对应点位置一致的变换，需要开发简单高效的算法来应对训练数据有限、训练时间短或代码复杂度受限的场景。

Method: 采用端到端可训练的简单算法，仅需少量Python代码实现，通过74张图像在19x15输入窗口上进行训练，展示了在立体视觉中的应用。

Result: 该算法在训练数据极少和训练时间很短的情况下，在某些设置中能够获得准确的结果，代码简洁性突出。

Conclusion: 这种简洁的算法为训练数据、训练时间或代码复杂度受限的相关场景提供了一个良好的起点。

Abstract: The problem of image registration is finding a transformation that aligns two
images, such that the corresponding points are in the same location. This paper
introduces a simple, end-to-end trainable algorithm that is implementable in a
few lines of Python code. The approach is shown to work with very little
training data and training time, while achieving accurate results in some
settings. An example application to stereo vision was trained from 74 images on
a 19x15 input window. With just a dozen lines of Python code this algorithm
excels in brevity and may serve as a good start in related scenarios with
limitations to training data, training time or code complexity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ArConv的新型卷积层，通过重新设计和优化卷积层来降低计算复杂度，创建了仅含130万参数的轻量级模型，在RfMiD数据集上比MobileNetV2表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高深度神经网络模型的可访问性，特别是在移动设备上应用，用于眼部疾病早期诊断。现有方法计算复杂，需要更高效的模型。

Method: 在基础层面重新设计和优化卷积层，开发了新型ArConv卷积层，构建了轻量级通用模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化卷积层设计的轻量级模型在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，适合移动设备部署，提高了神经网络在医疗诊断中的可访问性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are continually evolving, with some efforts
aimed at improving accuracy, others at increasing speed, and some at enhancing
accessibility. Improving accessibility broadens the application of neural
networks across a wider range of tasks, including the detection of eye
diseases. Early diagnosis of eye diseases and consulting an ophthalmologist can
prevent many vision disorders. Given the importance of this issue, various
datasets have been collected from the cornea to facilitate the process of
making neural network models. However, most of the methods introduced in the
past are computationally complex. In this study, we tried to increase the
accessibility of deep neural network models. We did this at the most
fundamental level, specifically by redesigning and optimizing the convolutional
layers. By doing so, we created a new general model that incorporates our novel
convolutional layer named ArConv layers. Thanks to the efficient performance of
this new layer, the model has suitable complexity for use in mobile phones and
can perform the task of diagnosing the presence of disease with high accuracy.
The final model we present contains only 1.3 million parameters. In comparison
to the MobileNetV2 model, which has 2.2 million parameters, our model
demonstrated better accuracy when trained and evaluated on the RfMiD dataset
under identical conditions, achieving an accuracy of 0.9328 versus 0.9266 on
the RfMiD test set.

TL;DR: Kaleido是一个用于照片级真实感神经渲染的生成模型，将3D视为视频的特殊子域，通过序列到序列的图像合成实现生成式视图合成，无需显式3D表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经渲染方法依赖显式3D表示和大量相机标注数据，限制了可扩展性和性能。Kaleido旨在通过统一3D和视频建模，利用大规模视频数据进行预训练，减少对稀缺3D数据的依赖。

Method: 采用序列到序列生成框架，通过掩码自回归框架实现多视图条件生成，使用仅解码器的整流流变换器统一3D和视频建模，利用大规模视频数据进行预训练。

Result: 在多个视图合成基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在少视图设置中零样本性能显著优于其他生成方法，在多视图设置中首次匹配逐场景优化方法的质量。

Conclusion: Kaleido证明了将3D视为视频子域的统一框架的有效性，通过大规模视频预训练显著提升了神经渲染的性能和泛化能力，为生成式视图合成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a family of generative models designed for
photorealistic, unified object- and scene-level neural rendering. Kaleido
operates on the principle that 3D can be regarded as a specialised sub-domain
of video, expressed purely as a sequence-to-sequence image synthesis task.
Through a systemic study of scaling sequence-to-sequence generative neural
rendering, we introduce key architectural innovations that enable our model to:
i) perform generative view synthesis without explicit 3D representations; ii)
generate any number of 6-DoF target views conditioned on any number of
reference views via a masked autoregressive framework; and iii) seamlessly
unify 3D and video modelling within a single decoder-only rectified flow
transformer. Within this unified framework, Kaleido leverages large-scale video
data for pre-training, which significantly improves spatial consistency and
reduces reliance on scarce, camera-labelled 3D datasets -- all without any
architectural modifications. Kaleido sets a new state-of-the-art on a range of
view synthesis benchmarks. Its zero-shot performance substantially outperforms
other generative methods in few-view settings, and, for the first time, matches
the quality of per-scene optimisation methods in many-view settings.

TL;DR: 提出CoSSeg-TTA框架，基于nnU-Netv2，结合半监督均值教师方案和领域适应模块，用于Gd-EOB-DTPA增强肝胆期MRI的肝脏分割，在低标注条件下实现优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比增强MRI肝脏分割面临标注数据有限、增强协议异质、跨扫描仪和机构领域偏移等挑战，现有图像翻译方法存在结构扭曲、训练不稳定等问题。

Method: 基于nnU-Netv2构建紧凑分割框架，采用半监督均值教师方案利用未标注数据，集成随机化直方图风格外观转换函数和可训练对比感知网络的领域适应模块，并使用持续测试时适应策略。

Result: 在广泛实验中，该框架持续优于nnU-Netv2基线，获得更高的Dice分数和更优的Hausdorff距离，在低标注条件下对未见领域表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoSSeg-TTA框架有效解决了GED4模态肝脏分割的挑战，通过领域适应和测试时适应策略显著提升了模型性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation from contrast-enhanced MRI is essential for
diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, it remains
challenging due to limited annotated data, heterogeneous enhancement protocols,
and significant domain shifts across scanners and institutions. Traditional
image-to-image translation frameworks have made great progress in domain
generalization, but their application is not straightforward. For example,
Pix2Pix requires image registration, and cycle-GAN cannot be integrated
seamlessly into segmentation pipelines. Meanwhile, these methods are originally
used to deal with cross-modality scenarios, and often introduce structural
distortions and suffer from unstable training, which may pose drawbacks in our
single-modality scenario. To address these challenges, we propose CoSSeg-TTA, a
compact segmentation framework for the GED4 (Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced hepatobiliary
phase MRI) modality built upon nnU-Netv2 and enhanced with a semi-supervised
mean teacher scheme to exploit large amounts of unlabeled volumes. A domain
adaptation module, incorporating a randomized histogram-based style appearance
transfer function and a trainable contrast-aware network, enriches domain
diversity and mitigates cross-center variability. Furthermore, a continual
test-time adaptation strategy is employed to improve robustness during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms the nnU-Netv2 baseline, achieving superior Dice score and Hausdorff
Distance while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen domains under
low-annotation conditions.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于概念解释的对抗补丁防御方法，无需预先知道补丁大小或位置，通过抑制最具影响力的概念激活向量来中和补丁效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法通常需要预先知道补丁大小或位置，限制了实际应用。需要开发一种补丁无关的防御策略。

Method: 利用基于概念的解释来识别和抑制最具影响力的概念激活向量，从而在不显式检测的情况下中和补丁效果。

Result: 在Imagenette数据集上使用ResNet-50评估，相比最先进的PatchCleanser方法，获得了更高的鲁棒性和清洁准确率，在不同补丁大小和位置下保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: 将可解释性与鲁棒性结合具有前景，概念驱动的防御策略为保护机器学习模型免受对抗补丁攻击提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a practical threat to deep learning models by
forcing targeted misclassifications through localized perturbations, often
realized in the physical world. Existing defenses typically assume prior
knowledge of patch size or location, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose a patch-agnostic defense that leverages concept-based
explanations to identify and suppress the most influential concept activation
vectors, thereby neutralizing patch effects without explicit detection.
Evaluated on Imagenette with a ResNet-50, our method achieves higher robust and
clean accuracy than the state-of-the-art PatchCleanser, while maintaining
strong performance across varying patch sizes and locations. Our results
highlight the promise of combining interpretability with robustness and suggest
concept-driven defenses as a scalable strategy for securing machine learning
models against adversarial patch attacks.

TL;DR: 提出Adapt-STformer方法，通过循环可变形Transformer编码器实现灵活高效的序列视觉地点识别，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率和降低内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的序列视觉地点识别方法过于注重性能而牺牲了灵活性、推理速度和内存效率，无法满足实时应用需求。

Method: 设计循环可变形Transformer编码器(Recurrent-DTE)，采用迭代循环机制融合多帧序列信息，支持可变序列长度。

Result: 在Nordland、Oxford和NuScenes数据集上，召回率提升高达17%，序列提取时间减少36%，内存使用降低35%。

Conclusion: Adapt-STformer在保持高性能的同时实现了灵活性、快速推理和低内存使用，为实时序列视觉地点识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Sequential Visual Place Recognition (Seq-VPR) leverages transformers to
capture spatio-temporal features effectively; however, existing approaches
prioritize performance at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. In
practice, a transformer-based Seq-VPR model should be flexible to the number of
frames per sequence (seq-length), deliver fast inference, and have low memory
usage to meet real-time constraints. To our knowledge, no existing
transformer-based Seq-VPR method achieves both flexibility and efficiency. To
address this gap, we propose Adapt-STformer, a Seq-VPR method built around our
novel Recurrent Deformable Transformer Encoder (Recurrent-DTE), which uses an
iterative recurrent mechanism to fuse information from multiple sequential
frames. This design naturally supports variable seq-lengths, fast inference,
and low memory usage. Experiments on the Nordland, Oxford, and NuScenes
datasets show that Adapt-STformer boosts recall by up to 17% while reducing
sequence extraction time by 36% and lowering memory usage by 35% compared to
the second-best baseline.

Motivation: 现有大型生成模型在图像编辑和上下文图像生成方面取得进展，但在确保物理一致性方面存在关键差距，这对于世界模拟相关任务尤为重要。

Method: 将输入和编辑图像视为视频的首尾帧，利用预训练视频生成模型；引入时间推理阶段，在推理时联合去噪目标帧和推理token来想象合理的编辑轨迹。

Result: 在PBench-Edit基准测试中，ChronoEdit在视觉保真度和物理合理性方面均优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ChronoEdit通过将图像编辑重新定义为视频生成问题，有效解决了物理一致性问题，为需要物理一致性的图像编辑任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have significantly advanced image
editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring
physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This
capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this
paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a
video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images
as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large
pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but
also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal
consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that
explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target
frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing
trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable
transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to
avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate
ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for
contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical
plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit
will be released on the project page:

Motivation: 帕金森病的客观步态评估受限于缺乏大型、多样化且临床注释的运动数据集。

Method: 将所有记录（RGB视频或运动捕捉）通过统一预处理流程转换为匿名SMPL网格，支持监督临床评分预测和无监督运动预训练任务。

Result: 编码器始终优于手工特征，在CARE-PD上预训练可将MPJPE从60.8mm降至7.5mm，并将PD严重程度宏F1提高17个百分点。

Conclusion: CARE-PD展示了临床策划、多样化训练数据的价值，所有数据和基准代码已发布供非商业研究使用。

Abstract: Objective gait assessment in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is limited by the
absence of large, diverse, and clinically annotated motion datasets. We
introduce CARE-PD, the largest publicly available archive of 3D mesh gait data
for PD, and the first multi-site collection spanning 9 cohorts from 8 clinical
centers. All recordings (RGB video or motion capture) are converted into
anonymized SMPL meshes via a harmonized preprocessing pipeline. CARE-PD
supports two key benchmarks: supervised clinical score prediction (estimating
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS, gait scores) and unsupervised
motion pretext tasks (2D-to-3D keypoint lifting and full-body 3D
reconstruction). Clinical prediction is evaluated under four generalization
protocols: within-dataset, cross-dataset, leave-one-dataset-out, and
multi-dataset in-domain adaptation. To assess clinical relevance, we compare
state-of-the-art motion encoders with a traditional gait-feature baseline,
finding that encoders consistently outperform handcrafted features. Pretraining
on CARE-PD reduces MPJPE (from 60.8mm to 7.5mm) and boosts PD severity macro-F1
by 17 percentage points, underscoring the value of clinically curated, diverse
training data. CARE-PD and all benchmark code are released for non-commercial

TL;DR: GenAR是一个多尺度自回归框架，通过从粗到细的方式预测空间转录组学数据，将基因聚类为层次组以捕捉跨基因依赖关系，直接预测原始计数而非连续值，并在解码时融合组织学和空间嵌入信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学(ST)成本高昂，而从广泛可用的H&E染色图像预测基因表达是一种经济有效的替代方案。现有方法存在两个问题：(i)独立预测每个基因，忽略了共表达结构；(ii)将任务视为连续回归，而表达是离散计数，这会导致生物学上不合理的输出并复杂化下游分析。

Method: GenAR采用多尺度自回归框架，将基因聚类为层次组以暴露跨基因依赖关系，将表达建模为无码本的离散标记生成以直接预测原始计数，并在解码时基于融合的组织学和空间嵌入进行条件解码。

Result: 在四个不同组织类型的空间转录组学数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，GenAR实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GenAR通过离散建模和从粗到细的因子分解避免了log诱导的偏差，为精准医学和经济有效的分子分析提供了潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) offers spatially resolved gene expression but
remains costly. Predicting expression directly from widely available
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images presents a cost-effective
alternative. However, most computational approaches (i) predict each gene
independently, overlooking co-expression structure, and (ii) cast the task as
continuous regression despite expression being discrete counts. This mismatch
can yield biologically implausible outputs and complicate downstream analyses.
We introduce GenAR, a multi-scale autoregressive framework that refines
predictions from coarse to fine. GenAR clusters genes into hierarchical groups
to expose cross-gene dependencies, models expression as codebook-free discrete
token generation to directly predict raw counts, and conditions decoding on
fused histological and spatial embeddings. From an information-theoretic
perspective, the discrete formulation avoids log-induced biases and the
coarse-to-fine factorization aligns with a principled conditional
decomposition. Extensive experimental results on four Spatial Transcriptomics
datasets across different tissue types demonstrate that GenAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, offering potential implications for precision
medicine and cost-effective molecular profiling. Code is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模仿学习缺乏恢复数据，小错误会累积导致失败。现有基于神经渲染或游戏引擎的方法成本高、速度慢，主要仅用于评估。作者认为逼真性对训练端到端规划器不重要，关键是语义保真度和可扩展性。

Method: 提出3D栅格化技术，用轻量级栅格化替代昂贵渲染；引入栅格到实景特征空间对齐来弥合仿真与现实的差距；结合形成RAP数据增强流水线。

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2、Waymo Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving和Bench2Drive四个主要基准测试中排名第一，实现了最先进的闭环鲁棒性和长尾泛化能力。

Conclusion: 轻量级栅格化配合特征对齐足以扩展端到端训练，为逼真渲染提供了实用替代方案。

Abstract: Imitation learning for end-to-end driving trains policies only on expert
demonstrations. Once deployed in a closed loop, such policies lack recovery
data: small mistakes cannot be corrected and quickly compound into failures. A
promising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories
beyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via
neural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and
costly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that
photorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is
semantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics,
not textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which
replaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated
primitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers
and cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively
to real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment
that bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization
Augmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning.
RAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail
generalization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo
Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive. Our results show that
lightweight rasterization with feature alignment suffices to scale E2E
training, offering a practical alternative to photorealistic rendering. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中如盲区突然出现行人时，往往缺乏足够的观测数据（瞬时轨迹），导致准确预测困难并增加交通事故风险，因此需要研究极端场景下的行人轨迹预测。

Method: 使用两个序列连接的扩散模型：反向预测模型生成未观测历史轨迹，前向预测模型预测未来轨迹。提出双头参数化机制估计不确定性，并设计时间自适应噪声模块动态调节噪声尺度。

Result: 在ETH/UCY和Stanford Drone数据集上实现了瞬时轨迹预测的最新最优性能。

Conclusion: Diffusion^2框架有效解决了瞬时轨迹预测问题，为自动驾驶和人机交互场景中的交通安全提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier
studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future
trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly
emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable
(i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and
increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on
pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for
enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed
Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists
of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction,
which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward
prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated
unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a
dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty
and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the
noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a
new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford
Drone datasets.

Abstract: World models that support controllable
  and editable spatiotemporal environments are valuable
  for robotics, enabling scalable training data, repro ducible evaluation, and
flexible task design. While
  recent text-to-video models generate realistic dynam ics, they are
constrained to 2D views and offer limited
  interaction. We introduce MorphoSim, a language guided framework that
generates 4D scenes with
  multi-view consistency and object-level controls. From
  natural language instructions, MorphoSim produces
  dynamic environments where objects can be directed,
  recolored, or removed, and scenes can be observed
  from arbitrary viewpoints. The framework integrates
  trajectory-guided generation with feature field dis tillation, allowing edits
to be applied interactively

### [109] [Your Vision-Language Model Can't Even Count to 20: Exposing the Failures of VLMs in Compositional Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04401)
*Xuyang Guo,Zekai Huang,Zhenmei Shi,Zhao Song,Jiahao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了VLMCountBench基准测试，专门评估视觉语言模型在简单几何形状计数任务中的表现，发现当前模型在组合计数方面存在显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在各种任务上表现出色，但它们在基本计数能力方面的表现尚未被系统研究，特别是在组合计数场景下。

Method: 设计了极简的基准测试VLMCountBench，使用基本几何形状（三角形、圆形等）及其组合，严格控制变量，系统研究颜色、大小和提示词优化等因素的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，当只有单一形状类型时，VLMs能够可靠计数；但当多种形状类型组合时，模型在组合计数方面出现显著失败。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在组合计数方面存在基本经验局限性，这为未来研究指明了重要方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a central focus of today's AI
community, owing to their impressive abilities gained from training on
large-scale vision-language data from the Web. These models have demonstrated
strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video
understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these
noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects
correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark,
VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric
shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively
on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict
independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple
properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation.
Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one
shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape
types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a
fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important
directions for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CodeFormer++是一个用于盲人脸恢复的新框架，通过分解任务为身份保持恢复、高质量生成和动态融合，解决了现有方法在视觉质量和身份保真度之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有盲人脸恢复方法在整合生成先验时，往往面临视觉质量与身份保真度之间的权衡，导致身份失真或降质去除不理想。

Method: 提出三个关键技术：(1)基于学习的可变形人脸配准模块进行语义对齐；(2)纹理引导恢复网络动态提取和传递生成人脸纹理；(3)结合深度度量学习生成信息性正负样本以更好地融合身份保持和生成特征。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据集上的广泛实验表明，CodeFormer++在视觉保真度和身份一致性方面均取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: CodeFormer++通过最大化生成先验的效用，实现了高质量人脸恢复同时保持身份信息，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) has attracted increasing attention with the rise
of generative methods. Most existing approaches integrate generative priors
into the restoration pro- cess, aiming to jointly address facial detail
generation and identity preservation. However, these methods often suffer from
a trade-off between visual quality and identity fidelity, leading to either
identity distortion or suboptimal degradation removal. In this paper, we
present CodeFormer++, a novel framework that maximizes the utility of
generative priors for high-quality face restoration while preserving identity.
We decompose BFR into three sub-tasks: (i) identity- preserving face
restoration, (ii) high-quality face generation, and (iii) dynamic fusion of
identity features with realistic texture details. Our method makes three key
contributions: (1) a learning-based deformable face registration module that
semantically aligns generated and restored faces; (2) a texture guided
restoration network to dynamically extract and transfer the texture of
generated face to boost the quality of identity-preserving restored face; and
(3) the integration of deep metric learning for BFR with the generation of
informative positive and hard negative samples to better fuse identity-
preserving and generative features. Extensive experiments on real-world and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that, the pro- posed CodeFormer++ achieves
superior performance in terms of both visual fidelity and identity consistency.

*Yuanhao Zou,Shengji Jin,Andong Deng,Youpeng Zhao,Jun Wang,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出A.I.R.方法，一种无需训练的自适应迭代推理帧选择方法，用于视频问答中的高效帧选择，平衡了准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有帧选择方法面临关键权衡：轻量级相似度模型无法捕捉复杂查询的细微差别，而使用VLM进行深度分析的方法计算成本过高。

Method: 利用强大的VLM对复杂查询进行深度语义分析，在成本效益高的迭代循环中每次只处理一小批最有潜力的帧。

Result: 在多个VideoQA基准测试中表现优于现有帧选择方法，显著提升了基础VLM的性能，并在计算效率上实现了大幅提升。

Conclusion: A.I.R.方法有效解决了视频问答中帧选择的准确性与计算效率之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Effectively applying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to Video Question
Answering (VideoQA) hinges on selecting a concise yet comprehensive set of
frames, as processing entire videos is computationally infeasible. However,
current frame selection methods face a critical trade-off: approaches relying
on lightweight similarity models, such as CLIP, often fail to capture the
nuances of complex queries, resulting in inaccurate similarity scores that
cannot reflect the authentic query-frame relevance, which further undermines
frame selection. Meanwhile, methods that leverage a VLM for deeper analysis
achieve higher accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs. To address
these limitations, we propose A.I.R., a training-free approach for Adaptive,
Iterative, and Reasoning-based frame selection. We leverage a powerful VLM to
perform deep, semantic analysis on complex queries, and this analysis is
deployed within a cost-effective iterative loop that processes only a small
batch of the most high-potential frames at a time. Extensive experiments on
various VideoQA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
frame selection methods, significantly boosts the performance of the foundation
VLM, and achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency over other
VLM-based techniques.

*Qiyuan He,Yicong Li,Haotian Ye,Jinghao Wang,Xinyao Liao,Pheng-Ann Heng,Stefano Ermon,James Zou,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出reAR训练策略，通过token-wise正则化解决自回归视觉生成中的生成器-分词器不一致问题，显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归生成性能落后于扩散模型，核心瓶颈在于生成器与分词器的不一致性——AR生成的token可能无法被分词器良好解码

Method: 引入token-wise正则化目标：在预测下一个token时，因果transformer同时训练恢复当前token的视觉嵌入，并在噪声上下文中预测目标token的嵌入

Result: 在ImageNet上，gFID从3.02降至1.86，IS提升至316.9；应用于先进分词器时，仅用177M参数达到gFID 1.42，匹配675M参数扩散模型性能

Conclusion: reAR是一种简单有效的训练策略，无需改变分词器、生成顺序、推理流程或外部模型，就能显著提升视觉自回归生成性能

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (AR) generation offers a promising path toward unifying
vision and language models, yet its performance remains suboptimal against
diffusion models. Prior work often attributes this gap to tokenizer limitations
and rasterization ordering. In this work, we identify a core bottleneck from
the perspective of generator-tokenizer inconsistency, i.e., the AR-generated
tokens may not be well-decoded by the tokenizer. To address this, we propose
reAR, a simple training strategy introducing a token-wise regularization
objective: when predicting the next token, the causal transformer is also
trained to recover the visual embedding of the current token and predict the
embedding of the target token under a noisy context. It requires no changes to
the tokenizer, generation order, inference pipeline, or external models.
Despite its simplicity, reAR substantially improves performance. On ImageNet,
it reduces gFID from 3.02 to 1.86 and improves IS to 316.9 using a standard
rasterization-based tokenizer. When applied to advanced tokenizers, it achieves
a gFID of 1.42 with only 177M parameters, matching the performance with larger
state-of-the-art diffusion models (675M).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPEGNet提出了一种统一的伪装目标检测方法，通过通道校准和空间增强集成多尺度特征，避免传统方法中复杂组件累积带来的计算负担和细节丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪装目标检测方法依赖累积复杂组件（如边界模块、注意力机制、多尺度处理器），导致计算负担增加但性能提升不成比例，且为管理复杂度而降低分辨率会丢失精细细节。

Method: SPEGNet采用统一设计，通过通道校准和空间增强集成多尺度特征，边界直接从上下文丰富的表示中产生，保持语义-空间对齐，并采用渐进式细化和尺度自适应边缘调制。

Result: 在CAMO数据集上达到0.887 Sα，COD10K上0.890，NC4K上0.895，同时保持实时推理速度，在从微小复杂物体到大型模式相似物体的各种尺度上表现优异。

Conclusion: SPEGNet在边界精度和区域一致性之间取得平衡，能够处理遮挡和模糊边界，提供了一种高效且有效的伪装目标检测解决方案。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection segments objects with intrinsic similarity and
edge disruption. Current detection methods rely on accumulated complex
components. Each approach adds components such as boundary modules, attention
mechanisms, and multi-scale processors independently. This accumulation creates
a computational burden without proportional gains. To manage this complexity,
they process at reduced resolutions, eliminating fine details essential for
camouflage. We present SPEGNet, addressing fragmentation through a unified
design. The architecture integrates multi-scale features via channel
calibration and spatial enhancement. Boundaries emerge directly from
context-rich representations, maintaining semantic-spatial alignment.
Progressive refinement implements scale-adaptive edge modulation with peak
influence at intermediate resolutions. This design strikes a balance between
boundary precision and regional consistency. SPEGNet achieves 0.887 $S_\alpha$
on CAMO, 0.890 on COD10K, and 0.895 on NC4K, with real-time inference speed.
Our approach excels across scales, from tiny, intricate objects to large,
pattern-similar ones, while handling occlusion and ambiguous boundaries. Code,

Motivation: 将临床诊断推理与AI结合是医学影像中的核心挑战，需要开发能够生成逐步推理的医学视觉语言模型。

Method: 提出MedCLM自动化流程，将检测数据集转换为医学VQA数据，并采用集成推理链-课程策略，包含简单（显式病灶框）、中等（隐式定位）和困难（弱监督推理）三个阶段。

Result: MedCLM在多个医学VQA基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MedCLM为开发临床对齐的医学视觉语言模型提供了一个可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Bridging clinical diagnostic reasoning with AI remains a central challenge in
medical imaging. We introduce MedCLM, an automated pipeline that converts
detection datasets into large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA)
data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by linking lesion boxes to organ
segmentation and structured rationales. These contextual signals enable medical
vision-language models to generate question-answer pairs with step-by-step
reasoning. To utilize this data effectively, we propose an Integrated
CoT-Curriculum Strategy composed of an Easy stage with explicit lesion boxes
for visual grounding, a Medium stage that encourages implicit localization, and
a Hard stage for weakly supervised reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate
that MedCLM attains state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA
benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for developing clinically aligned
medical vision-language models.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在文化遗产等专业领域面临数据稀缺和领域知识不足的挑战，特别是在3D陶器文物分析方面表现不佳。

Method: 构建了包含664个古希腊陶器3D模型的VaseVQA-3D数据集，并开发了VaseVLM模型通过领域自适应训练提升模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress in
multimodal understanding tasks, demonstrating strong capabilities particularly
in general tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. However, when
dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts,
existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain
knowledge limitations. Due to the lack of targeted training data, current VLMs
struggle to effectively handle such culturally significant specialized tasks.
To address these challenges, we propose the VaseVQA-3D dataset, which serves as
the first 3D visual question answering dataset for ancient Greek pottery
analysis, collecting 664 ancient Greek vase 3D models with corresponding
question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We
further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact
analysis through domain-adaptive training. Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of our approach, where we improve by 12.8% on R@1 metrics and by
6.6% on lexical similarity compared with previous state-of-the-art on the
VaseVQA-3D dataset, significantly improving the recognition and understanding
of 3D vase artifacts, providing new technical pathways for digital heritage
preservation research.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation and editing technologies have enabled
state-of-the-art models to achieve impressive results in general domains.
However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often
encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce
TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain.
Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training
strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while
maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for
data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline,
encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to
acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing
data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a
hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting
modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a
two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first
stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency
enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate
datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a
self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that
TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both
objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出异步扩散模型，通过为不同像素分配不同的时间步长，让提示相关区域比无关区域更渐进地去噪，从而利用更清晰的像素间上下文，显著改善文本到图像的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用同步去噪，所有像素同时从噪声演化到清晰图像，导致提示相关区域只能参考相同噪声水平的无关区域，无法获得清晰上下文，最终影响文本到图像的对齐质量。

Method: 提出异步扩散模型框架，为不同像素分配不同的时间步长，重新制定逐像素去噪过程。通过动态调节单个像素的时间步长调度，让提示相关区域比无关区域更渐进地去噪。

Result: 大量实验表明，异步扩散模型能够显著改善各种提示下的文本到图像对齐效果。

Conclusion: 异步扩散模型通过差异化像素去噪策略，有效解决了传统同步去噪导致的文本对齐问题，为扩散模型的文本到图像生成提供了新的改进方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating high-quality
images. Yet, they often struggle to faithfully align the generated images with
the input prompts. This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all
pixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result,
during generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated
regions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately
impairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose
asynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct
timesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising
process. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels,
prompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions,
thereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently,
these prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can
significantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts. The code
repository for this work is available at https://github.com/hu-zijing/AsynDM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像生成中常出现语义不一致或幻觉问题，现有引导方法依赖外部信号或架构修改，计算开销大。

Method: 利用中间样本作为投影基，放大估计分数相对于该基的切向分量来修正采样轨迹，基于一阶泰勒展开形式化引导过程。

Result: TAG作为即插即用模块，以最小计算开销提高扩散采样保真度，提供扩散引导的新视角。

Conclusion: TAG是一种高效直接的引导方法，仅利用轨迹信号操作，无需修改扩散模型，能有效减少不一致性并提升样本质量。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image
generation, but often suffer from semantic inconsistencies or hallucinations.
While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they
often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural
modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this
paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and
direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without
modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample
as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated
scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We
formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion,
which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state
toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and
enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module
that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition,
offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示学习方法学习的是主要捕捉主导语义的通用表示，可能与定制化下游任务不匹配。例如在动物栖息地分析中，研究者优先考虑场景相关特征，而通用嵌入强调类别语义，导致次优结果。现有方法需要监督微调，计算和标注成本高。

Method: CRL首先使用大语言模型(LLM)根据用户指定的标准生成描述性文本来构建语义基，然后利用视觉语言模型(VLM)将图像表示投影到这个条件特征空间中。

Result: 在分类和检索任务上的大量实验证明了所提CRL方法的优越性和通用性。

Conclusion: 条件表示能够更好地捕捉特定标准的语义，可用于多个定制化任务，解决了通用表示与定制任务不匹配的问题。

Abstract: Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation
that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with
customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis,
researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings
emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution,
existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high
computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional
Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to
arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics
of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive
words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon
this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large
language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic
basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature
space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation
better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized
for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and
retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL.

Motivation: 现有病理学基础模型虽然强大，但缺乏能够决定查看区域、调整放大倍数并提供可解释诊断的实用智能体系统，主要障碍是缺乏临床对齐的专家行为监督数据。

Abstract: Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process
involving changes in magnification and movement between fields. Although recent
pathology foundation models are strong, practical agentic systems that decide
what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable
diagnoses are still lacking. The blocker is data: scalable, clinically aligned
supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not
written in textbooks or online, and therefore absent from large language model
training. We introduce the AI Session Recorder, which works with standard WSI
viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs
into standardized behavioral commands (inspect or peek at discrete
magnifications) and bounding boxes. A lightweight human-in-the-loop review
turns AI-drafted rationales into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired
"where to look" and "why it matters" supervision produced at roughly six times
lower labeling time. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathologist-o3, a
two-stage agent that first proposes regions of interest and then performs
behavior-guided reasoning. On gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection,
it achieved 84.5% precision, 100.0% recall, and 75.4% accuracy, exceeding the
state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our
knowledge, this constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems
in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated
supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a
path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant success in remote
sensing Earth observation data analysis. Numerous feature fusion techniques
address multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global
and local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract
structural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal
images. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and
sparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency
interaction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across
the spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a
high-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse
spatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency
filter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is
introduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses
low-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a
high-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity.
In addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances
feature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four
benchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that
S$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at https://github.com/HaoLiu-XDU/SSFin.

Abstract: Detecting manipulated media has now become a pressing issue with the recent
rise of deepfakes. Most existing approaches fail to generalize across diverse
datasets and generation techniques. We thus propose a novel ensemble framework,
combining the strengths of transformer-based architectures, such as Swin
Transformers and ViTs, and texture-based methods, to achieve better detection
accuracy and robustness. Our method introduces innovative data-splitting,
sequential training, frequency splitting, patch-based attention, and face
segmentation techniques to handle dataset imbalances, enhance high-impact
regions (e.g., eyes and mouth), and improve generalization. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance when tested on the DFWild-Cup dataset, a diverse
subset of eight deepfake datasets. The ensemble benefits from the
complementarity of these approaches, with transformers excelling in global
feature extraction and texturebased methods providing interpretability. This
work demonstrates that hybrid models can effectively address the evolving
challenges of deepfake detection, offering a robust solution for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了四种最佳分割方法与SLIC在森林砍伐检测中的性能，发现通过分类器融合方法能显著提升平衡准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在ForestEyes项目中，传统使用SLIC算法进行图像分割，但研究表明其他超像素方法在遥感图像分割中表现更好，可能更适合森林砍伐检测任务。

Method: 研究比较了四种最佳分割方法与SLIC，使用PyCaret AutoML库选择前五个分类器，并应用分类器融合方法。

Result: 初始结果显示不同分割方法间性能差异不大，但通过分类器融合方法后，平衡准确率有明显提升。

Conclusion: 分割方法的选择和机器学习模型的组合对于森林砍伐检测任务都很重要，分类器融合能显著改善检测性能。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a crucial step in various visual applications,
including environmental monitoring through remote sensing. In the context of
the ForestEyes project, which combines citizen science and machine learning to
detect deforestation in tropical forests, image segments are used for labeling
by volunteers and subsequent model training. Traditionally, the Simple Linear
Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm is adopted as the segmentation method.
However, recent studies have indicated that other superpixel-based methods
outperform SLIC in remote sensing image segmentation, and might suggest that
they are more suitable for the task of detecting deforested areas. In this
sense, this study investigated the impact of the four best segmentation
methods, together with SLIC, on the training of classifiers for the target
application. Initially, the results showed little variation in performance
among segmentation methods, even when selecting the top five classifiers using
the PyCaret AutoML library. However, by applying a classifier fusion approach
(ensemble of classifiers), noticeable improvements in balanced accuracy were
observed, highlighting the importance of both the choice of segmentation method
and the combination of machine learning-based models for deforestation
detection tasks.

TL;DR: EduPersona是一个大规模教育基准，专注于评估虚拟学生代理在课堂环境中的主观能力，包含多语言、多学科、多人格类型的数据集和三层评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育中的应用增多，虚拟学生代理在课堂模拟和教师培训中变得重要，但其课堂导向的主观能力尚未得到充分评估，限制了模型边界理解和可信部署。

Method: 构建EduPersona基准，包含1,308个真实课堂对话轮次，扩展到128k轮次；将主观性能分解为三个渐进任务：基本连贯性、学生真实性和长期人格一致性；对三个代表性LLM进行系统实验。

Result: 在所有任务上均显示显著改进：TASK1 +33.6%、TASK2 +30.6%、TASK3 +14.9%，证明了数据集的有效性和研究价值，同时揭示了人格建模的异质性难度。

Conclusion: EduPersona提供了首个专注于主观能力的课堂基准，建立了可解耦和可验证的研究范式，将开源数据集和框架以支持教育领域可信和类人AI的发展。

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly integrated into education, virtual
student agents are becoming vital for classroom simulation and teacher
training. Yet their classroom-oriented subjective abilities remain largely
unassessed, limiting understanding of model boundaries and hindering
trustworthy deployment. We present EduPersona, a large-scale benchmark spanning
two languages, three subjects, and ten persona types based on the Big Five
theory. The dataset contains 1,308 authentic classroom dialogue rounds,
corresponding to 12,814 teacher-student Q&A turns, and is further expanded
through persona stylization into roughly 10 times larger scale (128k turns),
providing a solid foundation for evaluation. Building on this resource, we
decompose hard-to-quantify subjective performance into three progressive tasks:
TASK1 basic coherence (whether behavior, emotion, expression, and voice align
with classroom context), TASK2 student realism, and TASK3 long-term persona
consistency, thereby establishing an evaluation framework grounded in
educational theory and research value. We conduct systematic experiments on
three representative LLMs, comparing their original versions with ten
persona-fine-tuned variants trained on EduPersona. Results show consistent and
significant average improvements across all tasks: TASK1 +33.6%, TASK2 +30.6%,
and TASK3 +14.9%. These improvements highlight the dataset's effectiveness and
research value, while also revealing the heterogeneous difficulty of persona
modeling. In summary, EduPersona delivers the first classroom benchmark
centered on subjective abilities, establishes a decoupled and verifiable
research paradigm, and we will open-source both the dataset and the framework
to support the broader research community in advancing trustworthy and
human-like AI for education.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层多阶段运动专家混合架构，用于从步态序列中预测心理特征，在PsyMo基准测试中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态编码了丰富的生物特征和行为信息，但利用行走方式推断心理特征仍是一个具有挑战性且未充分探索的问题

Method: 使用多阶段运动专家混合架构，在四个运动复杂度阶段处理行走周期，采用轻量级专家模型提取时空特征和任务特定门控模块

Result: 在涵盖17个心理特征的PsyMo基准测试中，该方法优于最先进的步态分析模型，运行级别加权F1得分为37.47%，受试者级别为44.6%

Conclusion: 多任务步态学习对于心理特征估计是可行的，为未来基于运动的心理推断研究奠定了基础

Abstract: Gait encodes rich biometric and behavioural information, yet leveraging the
manner of walking to infer psychological traits remains a challenging and
underexplored problem. We introduce a hierarchical Multi-Stage Mixture of
Movement Experts (MoME) architecture for multi-task prediction of psychological
attributes from gait sequences represented as 2D poses. MoME processes the
walking cycle in four stages of movement complexity, employing lightweight
expert models to extract spatio-temporal features and task-specific gating
modules to adaptively weight experts across traits and stages. Evaluated on the
PsyMo benchmark covering 17 psychological traits, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art gait analysis models, achieving a 37.47% weighted F1 score at
the run level and 44.6% at the subject level. Our experiments show that
integrating auxiliary tasks such as identity recognition, gender prediction,
and BMI estimation further improves psychological trait estimation. Our
findings demonstrate the viability of multi-task gait-based learning for
psychological trait estimation and provide a foundation for future research on
movement-informed psychological inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多概念个性化生成中，多个学习的概念在输出图像中会产生不希望的干扰或混合，即"概念混合"问题，需要解决。

Method: 提出ConceptSplit框架：1) Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA) - 仅调整交叉注意力中的值投影，避免修改键投影破坏注意力机制；2) Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA) - 在推理时优化输入潜在空间以缓解注意力纠缠。

Result: 通过大量定性和定量实验证明，ConceptSplit能够实现鲁棒的多概念个性化，减轻意外的概念干扰。

Conclusion: ConceptSplit通过创新的训练和推理方法有效解决了多概念个性化中的概念混合问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-concept personalization for text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models to represent several subjects in an image has gained much more
attention. The main challenge of this task is "concept mixing", where multiple
learned concepts interfere or blend undesirably in the output image. To address
this issue, in this paper, we present ConceptSplit, a novel framework to split
the individual concepts through training and inference. Our framework comprises
two key components. First, we introduce Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA), a
merging-free training method that focuses exclusively on adapting the value
projection in cross-attention. Based on our empirical analysis, we found that
modifying the key projection, a common approach in existing methods, can
disrupt the attention mechanism and lead to concept mixing. Second, we propose
Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA), which alleviates
attention entanglement during inference by optimizing the input latent. Through
extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that
ConceptSplit achieves robust multi-concept personalization, mitigating
unintended concept interference. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法展示了结合基础模型适应与协同训练在真实临床成像任务中的潜力，为多相多厂商MRI肝脏分割提供了有效的标签高效基线。

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation in multi-phase MRI is vital for liver fibrosis
assessment, yet labeled data is often scarce and unevenly distributed across
imaging modalities and vendor systems. We propose a label-efficient
segmentation approach that promotes cross-modality generalization under
real-world conditions, where GED4 hepatobiliary-phase annotations are limited,
non-contrast sequences (T1WI, T2WI, DWI) are unlabeled, and spatial
misalignment and missing phases are common. Our method integrates a
foundation-scale 3D segmentation backbone adapted via fine-tuning, co-training
with cross pseudo supervision to leverage unlabeled volumes, and a standardized
preprocessing pipeline. Without requiring spatial registration, the model
learns to generalize across MRI phases and vendors, demonstrating robust
segmentation performance in both labeled and unlabeled domains. Our results
exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed label-efficient baseline for liver
segmentation in multi-phase, multi-vendor MRI and highlight the potential of
combining foundation model adaptation with co-training for real-world clinical
imaging tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在保持面部身份一致性和实现精细表情控制之间存在挑战，需要一种能够忠实再现任何主体在任何特定面部表情下的生成模型。

Method: 基于ID一致的人脸基础模型，采用组合式设计，包含由FLAME blendshape参数引导的表情交叉注意力模块，并在丰富的图像和视频数据上进行训练。

Result: 模型在定性和定量评估中均优于现有方法，能够生成定制化且身份一致的表情，包括微表情和表情转换。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了身份一致性和精细表情控制之间的平衡问题，为AI驱动的故事讲述提供了更可靠的人类中心生成模型。

Abstract: Human-centric generative models designed for AI-driven storytelling must
bring together two core capabilities: identity consistency and precise control
over human performance. While recent diffusion-based approaches have made
significant progress in maintaining facial identity, achieving fine-grained
expression control without compromising identity remains challenging. In this
work, we present a diffusion-based framework that faithfully reimagines any
subject under any particular facial expression. Building on an ID-consistent
face foundation model, we adopt a compositional design featuring an expression
cross-attention module guided by FLAME blendshape parameters for explicit
control. Trained on a diverse mixture of image and video data rich in
expressive variation, our adapter generalizes beyond basic emotions to subtle
micro-expressions and expressive transitions, overlooked by prior works. In
addition, a pluggable Reference Adapter enables expression editing in real
images by transferring the appearance from a reference frame during synthesis.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model
outperforms existing methods in tailored and identity-consistent expression
generation. Code and models can be found at

Motivation: 现有方法无法建模真实人类反应的随机性和动态特性，导致生成的面部反应缺乏多样性和自然度。

Method: 提出ReactDiff框架，在扩散过程中融入两个关键先验：时序面部行为运动学和面部动作单元依赖关系，以引导模型生成符合人类面部解剖约束的平滑连贯反应。

Result: 在REACT2024数据集上的实验表明，该方法在反应质量、多样性和反应适切性方面均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ReactDiff通过整合面部运动学约束，成功解决了面部反应生成的多样性和自然度问题，为人类-计算机交互系统提供了更逼真的面部反应生成能力。

Abstract: The automatic generation of diverse and human-like facial reactions in dyadic
dialogue remains a critical challenge for human-computer interaction systems.
Existing methods fail to model the stochasticity and dynamics inherent in real
human reactions. To address this, we propose ReactDiff, a novel temporal
diffusion framework for generating diverse facial reactions that are
appropriate for responding to any given dialogue context. Our key insight is
that plausible human reactions demonstrate smoothness, and coherence over time,
and conform to constraints imposed by human facial anatomy. To achieve this,
ReactDiff incorporates two vital priors (spatio-temporal facial kinematics)
into the diffusion process: i) temporal facial behavioral kinematics and ii)
facial action unit dependencies. These two constraints guide the model toward
realistic human reaction manifolds, avoiding visually unrealistic jitters,
unstable transitions, unnatural expressions, and other artifacts. Extensive
experiments on the REACT2024 dataset demonstrate that our approach not only
achieves state-of-the-art reaction quality but also excels in diversity and
reaction appropriateness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于3D语义场景图预测的新方法，通过设计高区分度的物体特征编码器和对比预训练策略，显著提升了物体分类和关系预测的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在3D语义场景图预测中过度依赖图神经网络，但物体和关系特征的表示能力不足，限制了整体性能。研究发现物体特征质量对场景图准确性至关重要。

Method: 设计高区分度的物体特征编码器，采用对比预训练策略将物体表示学习与场景图预测解耦，并有效结合几何和语义特征进行关系预测。

Result: 在3DSSG数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有评估指标上显著优于现有最先进方法，将预训练编码器插入现有框架也能带来实质性性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过优化物体特征表示并有效整合关系信息，该方法在3D语义场景图预测任务中取得了突破性进展，为机器人和AR/VR应用提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Graph Prediction aims to detect objects and their semantic
relationships in 3D scenes, and has emerged as a crucial technology for
robotics and AR/VR applications. While previous research has addressed dataset
limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings,
they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and
relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks
despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate
through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical
role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we
design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive
pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the
scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification
accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction.
Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we
observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics.
Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the
integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric
and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction.
Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/OCRL-3DSSG-Codes.

TL;DR: 该研究首次建立了野生动物监测中的单目度量深度估计基准，评估了四种先进深度估计方法在相机陷阱图像上的性能，发现Depth Anything V2表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机陷阱广泛用于野生动物监测，但从单目图像中提取准确距离测量仍然具有挑战性，因为缺乏深度信息。现有单目深度估计方法在自然野生动物环境中的性能尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 在93张带有校准ChARUCO图案地面真实距离的相机陷阱图像上，评估了四种最先进的MDE方法（Depth Anything V2、ML Depth Pro、ZoeDepth和Metric3D）以及几何基线方法。

Result: Depth Anything V2实现了最佳整体性能，平均绝对误差为0.454m，相关性为0.962；而ZoeDepth在户外自然环境中表现显著下降（MAE：3.087m）。中值深度提取在所有深度学习方法中都优于均值方法。

Conclusion: 该基准为野生动物应用建立了性能基线，并为在保护监测系统中实施深度估计提供了实用指导。Depth Anything V2在准确性和速度之间提供了最佳平衡。

Abstract: Camera traps are widely used for wildlife monitoring, but extracting accurate
distance measurements from monocular images remains challenging due to the lack
of depth information. While monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods have
advanced significantly, their performance in natural wildlife environments has
not been systematically evaluated. This work introduces the first benchmark for
monocular metric depth estimation in wildlife monitoring conditions. We
evaluate four state-of-the-art MDE methods (Depth Anything V2, ML Depth Pro,
ZoeDepth, and Metric3D) alongside a geometric baseline on 93 camera trap images
with ground truth distances obtained using calibrated ChARUCO patterns. Our
results demonstrate that Depth Anything V2 achieves the best overall
performance with a mean absolute error of 0.454m and correlation of 0.962,
while methods like ZoeDepth show significant degradation in outdoor natural
environments (MAE: 3.087m). We find that median-based depth extraction
consistently outperforms mean-based approaches across all deep learning
methods. Additionally, we analyze computational efficiency, with ZoeDepth being
fastest (0.17s per image) but least accurate, while Depth Anything V2 provides
an optimal balance of accuracy and speed (0.22s per image). This benchmark
establishes performance baselines for wildlife applications and provides
practical guidance for implementing depth estimation in conservation monitoring
systems.

Abstract: Quantifying sponsor visibility in sports broadcasts is a critical marketing
task traditionally hindered by manual, subjective, and unscalable analysis
methods. While automated systems offer an alternative, their reliance on
axis-aligned Horizontal Bounding Box (HBB) leads to inaccurate exposuremetrics
when logos appear rotated or skewed due to dynamic camera angles and
perspective distortions. This paper introduces ExposureEngine, an end-to-end
system designed for accurate, rotation-aware sponsor visibility analytics in
sports broadcasts, demonstrated in a soccer case study. Our approach predicts
Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) to provide a geometrically precise fit to each logo
regardless of the orientation on-screen. To train and evaluate our detector, we
developed a new dataset comprising 1,103 frames from Swedish elite soccer,
featuring 670 unique sponsor logos annotated with OBBs. Our model achieves a
mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.859, with a precision of 0.96 and recall
of 0.87, demonstrating robust performance in localizing logos under diverse
broadcast conditions. The system integrates these detections into an analytical
pipeline that calculates precise visibility metrics, such as exposure duration
and on-screen coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate a language-driven agentic
layer, enabling users to generate reports, summaries, and media content through
natural language queries. The complete system, including the dataset and the
analytics dashboard, provides a comprehensive solution for auditable and
interpretable sponsor measurement in sports media. An overview of the

Motivation: 红外小目标检测在国防应用中面临复杂背景和小目标尺寸的挑战，传统目标检测器会产生大量误报。

Method: 在YOLO检测头中集成统计异常检测测试，将小目标视为背景中的异常模式。

Result: 在多个IRSTD基准测试中取得有竞争力的性能，在训练数据有限、噪声和域偏移场景下表现出显著鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AA-YOLO设计通用性强，可应用于各种YOLO骨干网络，包括轻量级模型，是资源受限实际部署的有吸引力的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) is a challenging task in defense
applications, where complex backgrounds and tiny target sizes often result in
numerous false alarms using conventional object detectors. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Anomaly-Aware YOLO (AA-YOLO), which integrates a
statistical anomaly detection test into its detection head. By treating small
targets as unexpected patterns against the background, AA-YOLO effectively
controls the false alarm rate. Our approach not only achieves competitive
performance on several IRSTD benchmarks, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness in scenarios with limited training data, noise, and domain shifts.
Furthermore, since only the detection head is modified, our design is highly
generic and has been successfully applied across various YOLO backbones,
including lightweight models. It also provides promising results when
integrated into an instance segmentation YOLO. This versatility makes AA-YOLO
an attractive solution for real-world deployments where resources are
constrained. The code will be publicly released.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of transformer-based architectures
for person identification in natural, face-to-face conversation scenario. We
implement and evaluate a two-stream framework that separately models spatial
configurations and temporal motion patterns of 133 COCO WholeBody keypoints,
extracted from a subset of the CANDOR conversational corpus. Our experiments
compare pre-trained and from-scratch training, investigate the use of velocity
features, and introduce a multi-scale temporal transformer for hierarchical
motion modeling. Results demonstrate that domain-specific training
significantly outperforms transfer learning, and that spatial configurations
carry more discriminative information than temporal dynamics. The spatial
transformer achieves 95.74% accuracy, while the multi-scale temporal
transformer achieves 93.90%. Feature-level fusion pushes performance to 98.03%,
confirming that postural and dynamic information are complementary. These
findings highlight the potential of transformer architectures for person

Conclusion: PG-Occ框架通过渐进式表示增强和自适应特征聚合，有效解决了文本对齐场景建模中的权衡问题，为开放词汇3D占用预测提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent
years, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While
traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches
have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary
text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in
text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to
capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs
significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present
PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables
open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive
online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D
Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively
enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and
detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of
an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which
adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and
stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene
information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ
achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement
over the previous best performing method. Code and pretrained models will be
released upon publication on our project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的开放词汇学习方法，通过生成未见类数据来估计开放环境中的分布，解决了现有方法因缺乏未见类数据而导致的分布估计误差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用已见类数据估计开放环境分布，由于未见类的缺失导致估计误差无法识别。学习超越已见类对于分布估计至关重要。

Method: 提出类域级数据生成流程和分布对齐算法。数据生成流程在层次语义树和从已见类数据推断的域信息指导下生成未见类数据；分布对齐算法估计并最大化后验概率以增强泛化能力。

Result: 在11个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法比基线方法性能提升高达14%，证明了其有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 通过理论证明和实验验证，生成未见类数据可以有效估计开放环境分布并上界估计误差，提出的方法在开放词汇学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary learning requires modeling the data distribution in open
environments, which consists of both seen-class and unseen-class data.
  Existing methods estimate the distribution in open environments using
seen-class data, where the absence of unseen classes makes the estimation error
inherently unidentifiable.
  Intuitively, learning beyond the seen classes is crucial for distribution
estimation to bound the estimation error.
  We theoretically demonstrate that the distribution can be effectively
estimated by generating unseen-class data, through which the estimation error
is upper-bounded.
  Building on this theoretical insight, we propose a novel open-vocabulary
learning method, which generates unseen-class data for estimating the
distribution in open environments. The method consists of a class-domain-wise
data generation pipeline and a distribution alignment algorithm. The data
generation pipeline generates unseen-class data under the guidance of a
hierarchical semantic tree and domain information inferred from the seen-class
data, facilitating accurate distribution estimation. With the generated data,
the distribution alignment algorithm estimates and maximizes the posterior
probability to enhance generalization in open-vocabulary learning. Extensive
experiments on $11$ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline
approaches by up to $14\%$, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

TL;DR: FedSurg挑战赛旨在评估联邦学习在手术视频分类中的泛化能力和适应性，使用多中心Appendix300数据集，发现ViViT模型表现最佳，但泛化能力有限且排名稳定性低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估联邦学习方法在手术视频分类中的泛化能力，测试模型对未见临床中心的适应性和本地微调效果，同时实现不共享患者数据的协作模型开发。

Method: 参与者开发策略对阑尾炎炎症阶段进行分类，评估两个任务：对未见中心的泛化能力和中心特定适应性。方法包括基础模型线性探测、三元组损失度量学习、联邦平均、联邦中位数和联邦SAM等聚合方案。

Result: 泛化任务中跨中心性能有限，适应任务中所有团队在微调后都有改善但排名稳定性低。ViViT提交获得最强整体性能，挑战凸显了泛化限制、类别不平衡敏感性和去中心化训练中超参数调优困难。

Conclusion: FedSurg挑战赛建立了手术视频分类中联邦学习策略的首个基准，揭示了本地个性化与全局鲁棒性之间的权衡，强调了架构选择、预处理和损失设计的重要性。

Abstract: Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art
in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess
how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt
through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development
without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to
classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the
multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks:
generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after
fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear
probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes
(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and
Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and
statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across
centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after
fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission
achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted
limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties
in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal
modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies.
Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for
evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight
the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and
underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss
design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of
imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化双机器人3D扫描系统，用于文化遗产数字化，通过协调的机器人操作和高分辨率扫描实现全自动工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D扫描方法需要专业知识和手动干预来维持最佳扫描条件和覆盖范围，限制了文化遗产数字化的效率和可及性。

Method: 将扫描空间参数化为不同区域，使用扫描机器人和平板处理机器人进行协调运动规划，通过优化的轨迹规划和路径点分布确保全面表面覆盖。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法相比基线方法显著降低了Chamfer距离并提高了F分数，提供了更优的几何精度和数字化效率。

Conclusion: 该系统能够减少对专家操作员的依赖，为文化遗产保护提供高效、准确的自动化3D扫描解决方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D scanning is essential for preserving cultural heritage
artefacts, supporting documentation, analysis, and long-term conservation.
However, conventional methods typically require specialized expertise and
manual intervention to maintain optimal scanning conditions and coverage. We
present an automated two-robot scanning system that eliminates the need for
handheld or semi-automatic workflows by combining coordinated robotic
manipulation with high-resolution 3D scanning. Our system parameterizes the
scanning space into distinct regions, enabling coordinated motion planning
between a scanner-equipped robot and a tray-handling robot. Optimized
trajectory planning and waypoint distribution ensure comprehensive surface
coverage, minimize occlusions, and balance reconstruction accuracy with system
efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly
lower Chamfer Distance and higher F-score compared to baseline methods,
offering superior geometric accuracy, improved digitization efficiency, and
reduced reliance on expert operators.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较ViT和CNN在几何估计任务中的表现，发现在大数据场景下ViT表现更好，但在小数据场景下CNN的归纳偏置和较小容量使其表现与ViT相当，ViT在跨域评估中泛化能力更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ViT和CNN作为骨干网络在几何估计任务（如图像刚性变换和基础矩阵估计）中的效率，特别是在低数据场景下的表现。

Method: 系统比较大规模CNN（ResNet、EfficientNet、CLIP-ResNet）与ViT基础模型（CLIP-ViT变体和DINO）在不同数据规模设置下的性能，包括少样本场景。

Result: 在大数据场景下，ViT在微调时优于CNN；在小数据场景下，CNN的归纳偏置和较小容量使其表现与ViT相当；ViT在跨域评估中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 需要根据任务需求仔细选择模型架构进行微调，未来研究应关注平衡局部和全局表示的混合架构。

Abstract: Vision-transformers (ViTs) and large-scale convolution-neural-networks (CNNs)
have reshaped computer vision through pretrained feature representations that
enable strong transfer learning for diverse tasks. However, their efficiency as
backbone architectures for geometric estimation tasks involving image
deformations in low-data regimes remains an open question. This work considers
two such tasks: 1) estimating 2D rigid transformations between pairs of images
and 2) predicting the fundamental matrix for stereo image pairs, an important
problem in various applications, such as autonomous mobility, robotics, and 3D
scene reconstruction. Addressing this intriguing question, this work
systematically compares large-scale CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP-ResNet)
with ViT-based foundation models (CLIP-ViT variants and DINO) in various data
size settings, including few-shot scenarios. These pretrained models are
optimized for classification or contrastive learning, encouraging them to focus
mostly on high-level semantics. The considered tasks require balancing local
and global features differently, challenging the straightforward adoption of
these models as the backbone. Empirical comparative analysis shows that,
similar to training from scratch, ViTs outperform CNNs during refinement in
large downstream-data scenarios. However, in small data scenarios, the
inductive bias and smaller capacity of CNNs improve their performance, allowing
them to match that of a ViT. Moreover, ViTs exhibit stronger generalization in
cross-domain evaluation where the data distribution changes. These results
emphasize the importance of carefully selecting model architectures for
refinement, motivating future research towards hybrid architectures that
balance local and global representations.

TL;DR: DiT-VTON是一个基于扩散变换器的虚拟试穿框架，通过多种配置探索最佳图像条件设置，在扩展数据集上训练以增强鲁棒性，支持多种产品类别和图像编辑功能，在VITON-HD数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿模型在细节保留、真实图像鲁棒性、高效采样、图像编辑能力和跨产品类别泛化方面存在挑战，需要开发更强大的解决方案。

Method: 利用扩散变换器适应图像条件虚拟试穿任务，探索多种配置（上下文标记连接、通道连接、ControlNet集成），在包含多样化背景和非服装类别的扩展数据集上训练。

Result: 在VITON-HD数据集上超越最先进方法，实现更好的细节保留和鲁棒性，无需额外条件编码器；在涵盖数千产品类别的多样化数据集上，在虚拟试穿和图像编辑能力方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DiT-VTON重新定义了虚拟试穿任务，提供通用的虚拟试穿解决方案，能够处理广泛产品类别并支持高级图像编辑功能，展示了数据扩展对虚拟试穿适应性的益处。

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified the demand for Virtual Try-On
(VTO) technologies, enabling customers to realistically visualize products
overlaid on their own images. Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face
challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world
imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization
across diverse product categories. In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel
VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its
performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the
image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT
configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel
concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO
image conditioning.
  To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing
varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories,
demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also
redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual
Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories
and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose
preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level
customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation
and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also
outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset
spanning thousands of product categories.

TL;DR: EgoSurg是一个从固定摄像头视频重建手术室人员第一人称视角回放的框架，无需干扰临床工作流程，通过几何驱动的神经渲染和扩散模型增强视图质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手术观察方法依赖固定视角或回忆，无法记录指导临床决策的第一人称视觉视角，限制了手术安全、培训和流程优化的洞察。

Method: 结合几何驱动的神经渲染与基于扩散的视图增强，从壁挂固定摄像头视频合成任意时刻的任意第一人称视角。

Result: 在多地点手术案例和受控研究中，EgoSurg能够以高视觉质量和保真度重建人员特定的视觉场和任意视角。

Conclusion: EgoSurg将现有手术室摄像头基础设施转变为可导航的动态3D记录，为沉浸式手术数据科学奠定新基础，使手术实践可以从每个角度可视化、体验和分析。

Abstract: Observing surgical practice has historically relied on fixed vantage points
or recollections, leaving the egocentric visual perspectives that guide
clinical decisions undocumented. Fixed-camera video can capture surgical
workflows at the room-scale, but cannot reconstruct what each team member
actually saw. Thus, these videos only provide limited insights into how
decisions that affect surgical safety, training, and workflow optimization are
made. Here we introduce EgoSurg, the first framework to reconstruct the
dynamic, egocentric replays for any operating room (OR) staff directly from
wall-mounted fixed-camera video, and thus, without intervention to clinical
workflow. EgoSurg couples geometry-driven neural rendering with diffusion-based
view enhancement, enabling high-visual fidelity synthesis of arbitrary and
egocentric viewpoints at any moment. In evaluation across multi-site surgical
cases and controlled studies, EgoSurg reconstructs person-specific visual
fields and arbitrary viewpoints with high visual quality and fidelity. By
transforming existing OR camera infrastructure into a navigable dynamic 3D
record, EgoSurg establishes a new foundation for immersive surgical data
science, enabling surgical practice to be visualized, experienced, and analyzed
from every angle.

TL;DR: 本文研究多模态语言模型（MLMs）在感知任务上的表现不佳问题，通过分析视觉键值令牌的信息流动，发现图像值令牌包含足够信息执行感知任务，但语言模型对视觉信息的处理存在缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解为什么多模态语言模型在感知密集型任务上表现不佳，特别是研究视觉键值令牌在模型中的信息流动和处理机制。

Method: 分析流行MLMs（LLaVA-OneVision、Qwen2.5-VL、Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT）的视觉键值令牌处理过程，研究视觉信息在语言模型中的流动，比较投影前后的视觉信息变化。

Result: 发现图像值令牌编码了足够的视觉信息来零样本执行分割、语义对应、时间对应和指代表达检测等任务；语言模型对视觉信息的增强与整体感知能力相关，但包含的视觉信息少于未经MLM微调的视觉编码器；后期语言层中的图像键令牌存在降低感知能力的人工痕迹。

Conclusion: 多模态语言模型的感知能力受限于语言模型对视觉信息的控制能力，改进视觉编码器和语言模型组件的训练方法可以显著提升感知性能。

Abstract: Despite interpretability work analyzing VIT encoders and transformer
activations, we don't yet understand why Multimodal Language Models (MLMs)
struggle on perception-heavy tasks. We offer an under-studied perspective by
examining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and
Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the
flow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value
tokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks
zero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and
referring expression detection. We find that while the language model does
augment the visual information received from the projection of input visual
encodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it
contains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual
encoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that
the visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in
later layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception
capability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information
in the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input
improves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal
that if language models were able to better control their visual information,
their perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style
questions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the
language model is not surfaced to the output! Our findings reveal insights into
the role of key-value tokens in multimodal systems, paving the way for deeper
mechanistic interpretability of MLMs and suggesting new directions for training
their visual encoder and language model components.

Motivation: 现有方法需要多视角服装捕捉或物理先验，无法在单视角监督下实现动态服装交互。AvatarVTON旨在解决这一问题，实现无需多视图数据或物理先验的动态虚拟试穿。

Method: 框架包含两个关键模块：1）互易流校正器，无先验的光流校正策略，稳定虚拟形象拟合并确保时间一致性；2）非线性变形器，将高斯图分解为视角姿态不变和视角姿态特定组件，实现自适应非线性服装变形。

Result: 扩展了现有基准测试，建立了4D虚拟试穿基准。广泛实验表明，AvatarVTON实现了高保真度、多样性和动态服装真实感。

Conclusion: AvatarVTON在AR/VR、游戏和数字人应用中表现出色，为4D虚拟试穿提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose AvatarVTON, the first 4D virtual try-on framework that generates
realistic try-on results from a single in-shop garment image, enabling free
pose control, novel-view rendering, and diverse garment choices. Unlike
existing methods, AvatarVTON supports dynamic garment interactions under
single-view supervision, without relying on multi-view garment captures or
physics priors. The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Reciprocal
Flow Rectifier, a prior-free optical-flow correction strategy that stabilizes
avatar fitting and ensures temporal coherence; and (2) a Non-Linear Deformer,
which decomposes Gaussian maps into view-pose-invariant and view-pose-specific
components, enabling adaptive, non-linear garment deformations. To establish a
benchmark for 4D virtual try-on, we extend existing baselines with unified
modules for fair qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Extensive
experiments show that AvatarVTON achieves high fidelity, diversity, and dynamic
garment realism, making it well-suited for AR/VR, gaming, and digital-human
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成合成CT(sCT)在实现MRI-only和CBCT自适应放疗中至关重要，可以提高治疗精度并减少患者辐射暴露。

Method: 采用完全3D流匹配框架，通过积分学习到的流匹配速度场将高斯噪声体积转换为sCT图像，使用轻量级3D编码器从输入MRI或CBCT中提取特征作为条件。

Result: 在SynthRAD2025挑战基准测试中，该方法能准确重建全局解剖结构，但由于内存和运行时间限制导致的训练分辨率较低，保留精细细节的能力有限。

Conclusion: 该方法在全局结构重建方面表现良好，但需要进一步研究基于补丁的训练和潜在空间流模型来提高分辨率和局部结构保真度。

Abstract: Generating synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI or CBCT plays a crucial role in
enabling MRI-only and CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy, improving treatment
precision while reducing patient radiation exposure. To address this task, we
adopt a fully 3D Flow Matching (FM) framework, motivated by recent work
demonstrating FM's efficiency in producing high-quality images. In our
approach, a Gaussian noise volume is transformed into an sCT image by
integrating a learned FM velocity field, conditioned on features extracted from
the input MRI or CBCT using a lightweight 3D encoder. We evaluated the method
on the SynthRAD2025 Challenge benchmark, training separate models for MRI
$\rightarrow$ sCT and CBCT $\rightarrow$ sCT across three anatomical regions:
abdomen, head and neck, and thorax. Validation and testing were performed
through the challenge submission system. The results indicate that the method
accurately reconstructs global anatomical structures; however, preservation of
fine details was limited, primarily due to the relatively low training
resolution imposed by memory and runtime constraints. Future work will explore
patch-based training and latent-space flow models to improve resolution and
local structural fidelity.

TL;DR: 提出AT-BPTT框架，通过动态调整截断位置和窗口大小来改进数据集蒸馏中的内循环优化，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法中的随机截断策略缺乏灵活性且效果欠佳，神经网络在不同训练阶段具有不同的学习动态，需要更智能的截断方法。

Method: AT-BPTT框架包含三个关键组件：基于概率的阶段感知时间步选择机制、基于梯度变化的自适应窗口大小策略、以及低秩Hessian近似来降低计算开销。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet和ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，AT-BPTT平均准确率比基线方法提高6.16%，内循环优化加速3.9倍，节省63%内存成本。

Conclusion: AT-BPTT通过动态适应梯度行为实现了更高效的数据集蒸馏，在性能和效率方面都达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient deep learning has positioned dataset
distillation as a pivotal technique for compressing training dataset while
preserving model performance. However, existing inner-loop optimization methods
for dataset distillation typically rely on random truncation strategies, which
lack flexibility and often yield suboptimal results. In this work, we observe
that neural networks exhibit distinct learning dynamics across different
training stages-early, middle, and late-making random truncation ineffective.
To address this limitation, we propose Automatic Truncated Backpropagation
Through Time (AT-BPTT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts both
truncation positions and window sizes according to intrinsic gradient behavior.
AT-BPTT introduces three key components: (1) a probabilistic mechanism for
stage-aware timestep selection, (2) an adaptive window sizing strategy based on
gradient variation, and (3) a low-rank Hessian approximation to reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that AT-BPTT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving accuracy by an average of 6.16% over baseline methods.
Moreover, our approach accelerates inner-loop optimization by 3.9x while saving
63% memory cost.

Abstract: An accurate and up-to-date model of a photovoltaic (PV) power plant is
essential for its optimal operation and maintenance. However, such a model may
not be easily available. This work introduces a novel approach for PV power
plant mapping based on aerial overview images. It enables the automation of the
mapping process while removing the reliance on third-party data. The presented
mapping method takes advantage of the structural layout of the power plants to
achieve detailed modeling down to the level of individual PV modules. The
approach relies on visual segmentation of PV modules in overview images and the
inference of structural information in each image, assigning modules to
individual benches, rows, and columns. We identify visual keypoints related to
the layout and use these to merge detections from multiple images while
maintaining their structural integrity. The presented method was experimentally
verified and evaluated on two different power plants. The final fusion of 3D
positions and semantic structures results in a compact georeferenced model
suitable for power plant maintenance.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic relationship between humans and the built
environment is a key challenge in disciplines ranging from environmental
psychology to reinforcement learning (RL). A central obstacle in modeling these
interactions is the inability to capture human psychological states in a way
that is both generalizable and privacy preserving. Traditional methods rely on
theoretical models or questionnaires, which are limited in scope, static, and
labor intensive. We present a kinesics recognition framework that infers the
communicative functions of human activity -- known as kinesics -- directly from
3D skeleton joint data. Combining a spatial-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the framework
leverages transfer learning to bypass the need for manually defined mappings
between physical actions and psychological categories. The approach preserves
user anonymity while uncovering latent structures in bodily movements that
reflect cognitive and emotional states. Our results on the Dyadic User
EngagemenT (DUET) dataset demonstrate that this method enables scalable,
accurate, and human-centered modeling of behavior, offering a new pathway for
enhancing RL-driven simulations of human-environment interaction.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate sensing, computing, and control to
improve infrastructure performance, focusing on economic goals like performance
and safety. However, they often neglect potential human-centered (or
''social'') benefits. Cyber-physical-social infrastructure systems (CPSIS) aim
to address this by aligning CPS with social objectives. This involves defining
social benefits, understanding human interactions with each other and
infrastructure, developing privacy-preserving measurement methods, modeling
these interactions for prediction, linking them to social benefits, and
actuating the physical environment to foster positive social outcomes. This
paper delves into recognizing dyadic human interactions using real-world data,
which is the backbone to measuring social behavior. This lays a foundation to
address the need to enhance understanding of the deeper meanings and mutual
responses inherent in human interactions. While RGB cameras are informative for
interaction recognition, privacy concerns arise. Depth sensors offer a
privacy-conscious alternative by analyzing skeletal movements. This study
compares five skeleton-based interaction recognition algorithms on a dataset of
12 dyadic interactions. Unlike single-person datasets, these interactions,
categorized into communication types like emblems and affect displays, offer

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合早期退出和知识蒸馏的方法，通过引入基于熵的损失函数来优化学生模型训练，在保持分类性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络虽然性能优越但计算成本高，不适用于实时和边缘应用。需要开发压缩技术来平衡准确性和效率。

Method: 整合早期退出和知识蒸馏技术，训练简化的学生早期退出模型。创新性地在教师分类错误时使用基于熵的损失函数。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100和SVHN数据集上的实验验证了该方法能显著降低计算复杂度而不影响分类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效优化了准确性与效率的权衡，为知识蒸馏在其他场景的应用开辟了新研究视角。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification with
relatively high efficiency, they still exhibit high computational costs, often
rendering them impractical for real-time and edge applications. Therefore, a
multitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs
while maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been
introduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a
desirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed
method effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques:
early exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit
model is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary
contribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student
early-exit model. In comparison to the conventional Knowledge Distillation
loss, our approach incorporates a new entropy-based loss for images where the
teacher's classification was incorrect. The proposed method optimizes the
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving significant
reductions in computational complexity without compromising classification
performance. The validity of this approach is substantiated by experimental
results on image classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN, which
further opens new research perspectives for Knowledge Distillation in other
contexts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: μDeepIQA是一种基于深度学习的图像质量评估方法，专门针对光学显微镜图像，通过卷积神经网络提供快速稳定的质量预测，并能可视化图像中空间变化的质量分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像质量评估方法在处理大规模数据集时计算成本高，且对超出理想域的图像表现不稳定。深度学习IQA方法能提供更好的性能、泛化能力和快速预测。

Method: 将用于自然图像的深度卷积神经网络架构重新训练，应用于光学显微镜数据，预测单个质量指标和全局质量分数，并提供基于图像块的质量预测。

Result: μDeepIQA能够提供快速稳定的图像质量预测，即使在标准方法理想范围之外也能泛化质量估计，并能可视化单个图像中空间变化的质量分布。

Conclusion: 光学显微镜研究可以从深度学习模型的泛化能力中受益，包括在存在异常值时的稳定性能、评估小图像块的能力以及快速预测。

Abstract: Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research
studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable
experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples
and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct
processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with
variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward
implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when
evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for
well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal
domain.
  To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based
IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability
and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by
previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for
IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same
architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores
for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable
predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside
the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA
provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize
spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that
optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep
learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers,
the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end, IoT-enabled robotic system for the
non-destructive, real-time, and spatially-resolved mapping of grape yield and
quality (Brix, Acidity) in vineyards. The system features a comprehensive
analytical pipeline that integrates two key modules: a high-performance model
for grape bunch detection and weight estimation, and a novel deep learning
framework for quality assessment from hyperspectral (HSI) data. A critical
barrier to in-field HSI is the ``domain shift" caused by variable illumination.
To overcome this, our quality assessment is powered by the Light-Invariant
Spectral Autoencoder (LISA), a domain-adversarial framework that learns
illumination-invariant features from uncalibrated data. We validated the
system's robustness on a purpose-built HSI dataset spanning three distinct
illumination domains: controlled artificial lighting (lab), and variable
natural sunlight captured in the morning and afternoon. Results show the
complete pipeline achieves a recall (0.82) for bunch detection and a $R^2$
(0.76) for weight prediction, while the LISA module improves quality prediction
generalization by over 20% compared to the baselines. By combining these robust
modules, the system successfully generates high-resolution, georeferenced data
of both grape yield and quality, providing actionable, data-driven insights for
precision viticulture.

Abstract: Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems,
guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management.
Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a
thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS)
tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by
bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted
surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000}
of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable
supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data,
together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and
algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for
AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles,
facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying
open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance
accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a
standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements
in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义感知层次共识(SAHC)方法，通过集成层次特定分类头来学习层次特征和关系，使用可训练层次矩阵指导网络以自监督方式学习层次结构，并引入层次共识机制确保不同层次级别概率分布的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在遥感图像分类中日益重要，但预定义的标签层次结构经常被忽视，大多数方法只关注细粒度分类方案，需要充分利用层次语义关系。

Method: 在深度网络架构中集成层次特定分类头，每个头专门处理不同粒度的类别；使用可训练层次矩阵以自监督方式学习层次结构；引入层次共识机制作为加权集成，确保跨层次概率分布一致性。

Result: 在三个具有不同层次复杂度的基准数据集上评估，使用不同骨干架构，实验结果显示该方法在指导网络学习和层次共识鲁棒性方面都有效。

Conclusion: SAHC方法能够有效利用层次分类任务的固有结构，在遥感图像分类任务中表现出良好的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning has become increasingly important in remote sensing image
classification due to its ability to extract semantic information from complex
data. Classification tasks often include predefined label hierarchies that
represent the semantic relationships among classes. However, these hierarchies
are frequently overlooked, and most approaches focus only on fine-grained
classification schemes. In this paper, we present a novel Semantics-Aware
Hierarchical Consensus (SAHC) method for learning hierarchical features and
relationships by integrating hierarchy-specific classification heads within a
deep network architecture, each specialized in different degrees of class
granularity. The proposed approach employs trainable hierarchy matrices, which
guide the network through the learning of the hierarchical structure in a
self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical consensus
mechanism to ensure consistent probability distributions across different
hierarchical levels. This mechanism acts as a weighted ensemble being able to
effectively leverage the inherent structure of the hierarchical classification
task. The proposed SAHC method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with
different degrees of hierarchical complexity on different tasks, using distinct
backbone architectures to effectively emphasize its adaptability. Experimental
results show both the effectiveness of the proposed approach in guiding network
learning and the robustness of the hierarchical consensus for remote sensing
image classification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对医学图像分类的解剖学引导混合专家框架REN，通过区域特异性专家网络和多重门控机制，在间质性肺病分类中显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE系统缺乏医学成像所需的解剖学约束，而肺部的解剖结构和区域疾病异质性对病理模式有重要影响。

Method: 利用解剖学先验训练7个专门针对不同肺叶和双侧肺组合的专家网络，通过多模态门控机制整合放射组学生物标志物和深度学习特征来优化专家贡献权重。

Result: 在ILD分类中，REN达到平均AUC 0.8646±0.0467，比SwinUNETR基线提升12.5%；下叶模型AUC达0.88-0.90，优于CNN模型(0.76-0.79)。

Conclusion: REN展示了强大的泛化能力和临床可解释性，为结构化医学成像应用提供了可扩展的解剖学引导方法。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have significantly contributed to
scalable machine learning by enabling specialized subnetworks to tackle complex
tasks efficiently. However, traditional MoE systems lack domain-specific
constraints essential for medical imaging, where anatomical structure and
regional disease heterogeneity strongly influence pathological patterns. Here,
we introduce Regional Expert Networks (REN), the first anatomically-informed
MoE framework tailored specifically for medical image classification. REN
leverages anatomical priors to train seven specialized experts, each dedicated
to distinct lung lobes and bilateral lung combinations, enabling precise
modeling of region-specific pathological variations. Multi-modal gating
mechanisms dynamically integrate radiomics biomarkers and deep learning (DL)
features (CNN, ViT, Mamba) to weight expert contributions optimally. Applied to
interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, REN achieves consistently
superior performance: the radiomics-guided ensemble reached an average AUC of
0.8646 +/- 0.0467, a +12.5 percent improvement over the SwinUNETR baseline (AUC
0.7685, p = 0.031). Region-specific experts further revealed that lower-lobe
models achieved AUCs of 0.88-0.90, surpassing DL counterparts (CNN: 0.76-0.79)
and aligning with known disease progression patterns. Through rigorous
patient-level cross-validation, REN demonstrates strong generalizability and
clinical interpretability, presenting a scalable, anatomically-guided approach
readily extensible to other structured medical imaging applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习需要大量人工标注，无监督主动学习(UAL)虽然减少了标注负担，但现有方法性能不足，主要依赖局部梯度评分，对噪声敏感且无法充分代表数据分布。

Method: 使用特定特征学习机(SFLM)量化样本重要性，定义重构差异指标进行初始样本选择，构建自然特征渐进框架(NFPF)。

Result: NFPF在视觉数据集上显著优于所有现有UAL方法，性能与监督AL方法相当，具有更强的鲁棒性和更好的数据分布覆盖。

Conclusion: NFPF通过创新的样本重要性度量方法，成功解决了UAL的性能瓶颈，为减少标注成本提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The effectiveness of modern deep learning models is predicated on the
availability of large-scale, human-annotated datasets, a process that is
notoriously expensive and time-consuming. While Active Learning (AL) offers a
strategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative
data, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement.
Unsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the
annotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing
UAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches
typically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance
estimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data
but also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the
full data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear
selection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the
Natural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes
how sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature
Learning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to
model performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful
Reconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our
comprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all
established UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL
methods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative
visualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance,
enhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CA3D-Diff是一个基于条件扩散模型的双向乳腺X线摄影视图转换框架，通过柱感知交叉注意力和隐式3D结构重建来解决乳腺图像视图转换中的结构不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实临床工作流中，乳腺X线摄影的CC和MLO视图可能因采集错误或压缩伪影而缺失或损坏，限制了后续分析的效能。视图间转换可以帮助恢复缺失视图并改善病灶对齐，但乳腺X线摄影中的大变形和组织重叠使得这项任务极具挑战性。

Method: 提出柱感知交叉注意力机制，利用解剖对应区域在视图间具有相似列位置的几何特性，应用高斯衰减偏置强调局部列相关性；引入隐式3D结构重建模块，将噪声2D潜在特征反投影到基于乳腺视图投影几何的粗略3D特征体积中，通过精炼后的3D结构指导跨视图生成。

Result: 广泛实验表明CA3D-Diff在双向任务中取得优越性能，在视觉保真度和结构一致性方面优于最先进方法。合成的视图有效改善了筛查环境中的单视图恶性分类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界诊断中具有实用价值，能够通过视图转换提升乳腺X线摄影分析的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Dual-view mammography, including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique
(MLO) projections, offers complementary anatomical views crucial for breast
cancer diagnosis. However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be
missing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression
artifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view
translation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike
natural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large
non-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which
obscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and
Implicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view
translation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address
cross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware
cross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that
anatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions
across views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise
correlations while suppressing distant mismatches. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit 3D structure reconstruction module that back-projects noisy 2D latents
into a coarse 3D feature volume based on breast-view projection geometry. The
reconstructed 3D structure is refined and injected into the denoising UNet to
guide cross-view generation with enhanced anatomical awareness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CA3D-Diff achieves superior performance in
bidirectional tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity
and structural consistency. Furthermore, the synthesized views effectively
improve single-view malignancy classification in screening settings,
demonstrating the practical value of our method in real-world diagnostics.

Motivation: 当前基于KL-VAE的tokenizer需要对抗损失，而扩散解码器虽然更理论化但需要迭代采样导致解码时间较长。为了解决这些限制，需要开发一种无需对抗训练且能快速采样的解码器。

Method: 提出新的像素扩散解码器架构，利用transformer组件和无GAN训练提高扩展性和训练稳定性，并通过蒸馏技术将扩散解码器性能复制到高效的单步解码器中。

Result: SSDD在重建FID上从0.87提升到0.50，吞吐量提高1.4倍，在DiTs中保持生成质量的同时采样速度提高3.8倍。

Conclusion: SSDD可以作为KL-VAE的直接替代品，用于构建更高质量和更快的生成模型。

Abstract: Tokenizers are a key component of state-of-the-art generative image models,
extracting the most important features from the signal while reducing data
dimension and redundancy. Most current tokenizers are based on KL-regularized
variational autoencoders (KL-VAE), trained with reconstruction, perceptual and
adversarial losses. Diffusion decoders have been proposed as a more principled
alternative to model the distribution over images conditioned on the latent.
However, matching the performance of KL-VAE still requires adversarial losses,
as well as a higher decoding time due to iterative sampling. To address these
limitations, we introduce a new pixel diffusion decoder architecture for
improved scaling and training stability, benefiting from transformer components
and GAN-free training. We use distillation to replicate the performance of the
diffusion decoder in an efficient single-step decoder. This makes SSDD the
first diffusion decoder optimized for single-step reconstruction trained
without adversarial losses, reaching higher reconstruction quality and faster
sampling than KL-VAE. In particular, SSDD improves reconstruction FID from
$0.87$ to $0.50$ with $1.4\times$ higher throughput and preserve generation
quality of DiTs with $3.8\times$ faster sampling. As such, SSDD can be used as
a drop-in replacement for KL-VAE, and for building higher-quality and faster
generative models.

Abstract: Being trained on large and vast datasets, visual foundation models (VFMs) can
be fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks, achieving remarkable performance
and efficiency in various computer vision applications. The high computation
cost of data collection and training motivates the owners of some VFMs to
distribute them alongside the license to protect their intellectual property
rights. However, a dishonest user of the protected model's copy may illegally
redistribute it, for example, to make a profit. As a consequence, the
development of reliable ownership verification tools is of great importance
today, since such methods can be used to differentiate between a redistributed
copy of the protected model and an independent model. In this paper, we propose
an approach to ownership verification of visual foundation models by
fine-tuning a small set of expressive layers of a VFM along with a small
encoder-decoder network to embed digital watermarks into an internal
representation of a hold-out set of input images. Importantly, the watermarks
embedded remain detectable in the functional copies of the protected model,
obtained, for example, by fine-tuning the VFM for a particular downstream task.
Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed method
yields a low probability of false detection of a non-watermarked model and a
low probability of false misdetection of a watermarked model.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly applied to safety-critical tasks
in resource-constrained environments, such as video-based driver action and
intention recognition. While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL)
methods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance
varies. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending
pre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent
representations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty
representation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against
eight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention
recognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and
uncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action
labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our
results show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution
classification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based
OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more
efficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition
characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons, leading to various movement
disorder symptoms. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to prevent adverse effects,
yet traditional diagnostic methods are often cumbersome and costly. In this
study, a machine learning-based approach is proposed using hand-drawn spiral
and wave images as potential biomarkers for PD detection. Our methodology
leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and
attention mechanisms to improve model performance and resilience against
overfitting. To enhance the diversity and richness of both spiral and wave
categories, the training dataset undergoes augmentation to increase the number
of images. The proposed architecture comprises three phases: utilizing
pre-trained CNNs, incorporating custom convolutional layers, and ensemble
voting. Employing hard voting further enhances performance by aggregating
predictions from multiple models. Experimental results show promising accuracy
rates. For spiral images, weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are

Abstract: Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer
vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships,
long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of
Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders
with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that
transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated
reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature.
This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training
methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars:
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL)
from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced
inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the
roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques,
addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal
grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through
systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design
principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open
challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We
further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate
rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM
capabilities. Additional resources and updates are maintained at:

Conclusion: 该方法在宽基线分割匹配中表现出色，并在3D实例分割和图像目标导航等下游任务中展示了优势

Abstract: Segment matching is an important intermediate task in computer vision that
establishes correspondences between semantically or geometrically coherent
regions across images. Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized
features, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater
robustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this
paper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle
wide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme
viewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of
these 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180
degree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and
local feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++
and Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on
relevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance segmentation and image-goal
navigation. Project Page: https://segmast3r.github.io/

Method: 使用一组对比度增强算法生成视觉上接近真实参考图像的伪参考图像，通过训练分类网络根据图像内容和失真选择最合适的对比度增强算法，最终以全参考方式评估对比度增强图像与退化图像之间的质量差异。

Result: 在包含对比度失真的三个数据库（CCID2014、TID2013和CSIQ）上的性能评估表明，该方法具有优异的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将无参考问题转化为全参考问题，有效解决了对比度失真图像的质量评估问题，在多个数据库上表现出色。

Abstract: Contrast change is an important factor that affects the quality of images.
During image capturing, unfavorable lighting conditions can cause contrast
change and visual quality loss. While various methods have been proposed to
assess the quality of images under different distortions such as blur and
noise, contrast distortion has been largely overlooked as its visual impact and
properties are different from other conventional types of distortions. In this
paper, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric for
contrast-distorted images. Using a set of contrast enhancement algorithms, we
aim to generate pseudo-reference images that are visually close to the actual
reference image, such that the NR problem is transformed to a Full-reference
(FR) assessment with higher accuracy. To this end, a large dataset of
contrast-enhanced images is produced to train a classification network that can
select the most suitable contrast enhancement algorithm based on image content
and distortion for pseudo-reference image generation. Finally, the evaluation
is performed in the FR manner to assess the quality difference between the
contrast-enhanced (pseudoreference) and degraded images. Performance evaluation
of the proposed method on three databases containing contrast distortions
(CCID2014, TID2013, and CSIQ), indicates the promising performance of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate classification of waste and industrial surface defects
is essential for ensuring sustainable waste management and maintaining high
standards in quality control. This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular
Classifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image
classification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone
for localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture
global semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is
incorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data,
enriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is
the neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that
dynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by
biological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data
complexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification,
we validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2),
which involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental
results across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms
traditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability. The Neuroplastic
Modular Classifier offers a scalable, high-performance solution for real-world
image classification, with strong applicability in both environmental and
industrial domains.

Abstract: While modern visual generation models excel at creating aesthetically
pleasing natural images, they struggle with producing or editing structured
visuals like charts, diagrams, and mathematical figures, which demand
composition planning, text rendering, and multimodal reasoning for factual
fidelity. To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic
investigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training,
and an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3
million high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing
programs and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on
it, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a
lightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage
training curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion,
and reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at
inference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for
generation and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an
accompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\&A
protocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models
reveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory.
Our model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning
yields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset,
model, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for
structured visuals.

Motivation: 研究如何在文本到视频生成中实现跨角色自然交互，解决角色身份保持和行为逻辑一致性的挑战，避免风格混淆问题

Conclusion: 该框架实现了先前不共存角色间的自然交互，同时保持风格保真度，为生成式故事叙述开辟了新形式

Abstract: Imagine Mr. Bean stepping into Tom and Jerry--can we generate videos where
characters interact naturally across different worlds? We study inter-character
interaction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve
each character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context
interaction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and
because mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters
appear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these
issues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and
behavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation
(CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style
data. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously
uncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a
curated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show
clear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and
robustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative
storytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page:

Result: 在复杂多步骤场景的广泛实验中，VChain显著提升了生成视频的质量

Conclusion: VChain通过注入多模态模型的视觉推理信号，有效解决了视频生成中复杂动态建模的挑战

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce smooth and visually appealing
clips, but they often struggle to synthesize complex dynamics with a coherent
chain of consequences. Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state
transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and
multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and
future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain,
a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual
reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically,
VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to
generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used
to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only
at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal
overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex,
multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of
generated videos.

Abstract: Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research
communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often
requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10
minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves
distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal
information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple
aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To
address these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101
research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and
speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta
Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos
convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we
propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation
video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout
refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,
subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing
slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate
that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and
informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward
automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and
code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.
