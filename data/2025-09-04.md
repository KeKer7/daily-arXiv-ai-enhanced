Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the
end-to-end driving tasks remain a question. In our work, we demonstrate that
combining end-to-end architectural design and knowledgeable VLMs yield
impressive performance on the driving tasks. It is worth noting that our method
only uses a single camera and is the best camera-only solution across the
leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based driving approach
and the potential for end-to-end driving tasks.

*Mennatullah Siam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究多模态大语言模型在视频中的像素级视觉基准能力，特别是识别物体运动模式的能力，并提出了新的运动中心性能力测试方法和基准测试集。


<details>

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/MSiam/PixFoundation-2.0.git.

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

Method: 提出一种基于强化学习的主动视频采集框架，该框架能够动态选择每个患者最信息丰富的心超视频。与依赖固定视频集的传统方法不同，该方法持续评估是否需要额外的成像，以优化准确性和效率。

Result: 在2,572名患者的数据上进行测试，该方法在仅使用47%心超视频的情况下达到了80.6%的分类准确率，相比完整采集减少了过半的视频采集量。

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了主动特征采集在改善主动莘缩症诊断方面的潜力，使心超声动图评估更加高效、可扩展和个性化。

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Method: 开发了LiGuard开源框架，提供结构化目录、内置数据处理功能、交互式算法调整和可视化工具，支持分类、检测、分割和跟踪任务。

Result: 通过案例研究证明了LiGuard的有效性，能够显著提高开发效率并促进代码共享。

Conclusion: LiGuard为激光雷达研究提供了一个高效、可扩展的软件开发框架，有助于减少重复工作并促进研究社区的合作与共享。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KG-DG是一个神经符号框架，通过整合视觉变换器和专家指导的符号推理，在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中实现了跨域泛化的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中模型在真实世界分布偏移下泛化能力不足的问题，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中的域泛化挑战。

Method: 结合视觉变换器和基于临床病变本体的符号推理，通过结构化规则特征和视网膜血管分割，采用置信度加权集成策略融合深度视觉表示，最小化域嵌入间的KL散度来对齐高层临床语义。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上取得显著改进：跨域设置下准确率提升5.2%，比基线ViT模型提高6%。符号模型在MDG中达到63.67%平均准确率，神经符号集成在SDG场景中达到最高准确率。病变特征准确率达84.65%，大幅超越纯神经方法。

Conclusion: 神经符号集成是构建临床鲁棒、域不变医学AI系统的有前景范式，符号组件不仅增强可解释性，还作为有效的正则化器。

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

*Victor Solomon,Piet Martens,Jingyu Liu,Rafal Angryk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EdgeAttNet网络，通过可学习边缘图增强U-Net的注意力机制，显著提升太阳细丝分割精度，特别是对细丝倒钩结构的识别能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉太阳细丝细尺度结构（特别是倒钩），主要由于长程依赖建模能力和空间细节处理能力有限

Method: 基于U-Net架构，引入从输入图像直接学习的边缘图，通过线性变换注意力Key和Query矩阵来引导自注意力机制，将结构先验显式整合到注意力计算中

Result: 在MAGFILO数据集上优于U-Net和其他基于U-Net的transformer基线，获得更高分割精度和显著更好的细丝倒钩识别能力，推理速度更快

Conclusion: EdgeAttNet通过将边缘结构先验整合到注意力机制中，有效提升了太阳细丝分割的空间敏感性和准确性，同时减少了可训练参数数量，适合实际部署

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

TL;DR: InstaDA是一个无需训练的双智能体系统，通过LLM和扩散模型的深度协作来增强实例分割数据集，在LVIS验证集上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实例分割数据标注成本高、类别不平衡的问题，现有方法缺乏LLM与扩散模型的深度协作，未能充分利用训练数据中的丰富信息。

Method: 提出训练免费的双智能体系统：1) Text-Agent通过Prompt Rethink机制迭代优化提示词，促进LLM与扩散模型协作；2) Image-Agent基于训练图像生成新实例来丰富数据分布。两个智能体作为独立自动化工作流运行。

Conclusion: InstaDA通过双智能体架构有效提升了实例分割数据集的多样性和质量，证明了LLM与扩散模型深度协作的价值，为数据增强提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

TL;DR: SPENet是一个用于少样本医学图像分割的自引导原型增强网络，通过多级原型生成和查询引导的局部原型增强来解决传统方法忽略类内变化的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于原型的方法在少样本医学图像分割中通常为支持图像生成单一全局原型来匹配查询图像，忽略了类内变化，导致性能受限

Method: 提出SPENet网络，包含两个核心模块：1) 多级原型生成(MPG)模块，同时生成全局原型和自适应数量的局部原型；2) 查询引导的局部原型增强(QLPE)模块，根据查询图像指导自适应优化支持原型

Result: 在三个公共医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，SPENet优于现有的最先进方法，实现了卓越的性能

Conclusion: SPENet通过多粒度原型匹配和查询引导的原型增强，有效解决了少样本医学图像分割中的类内变化问题，显著提升了分割性能

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像中小目标分割研究不足，缺乏专用数据集，且SAM模型在小目标分割上性能显著下降，主要由于粗粒度特征分辨率导致空间细节丢失

Method: SOPSeg框架包含区域自适应放大策略保持细节，定制化解码器集成边缘预测和渐进细化，以及针对遥感应用中广泛采用的定向边界框的新提示机制

Result: SOPSeg在小目标分割方面优于现有方法，并支持遥感任务的高效数据集构建

Conclusion: 构建了基于SODA-A的全面小目标实例分割数据集，将发布模型和数据集以支持未来研究

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

Conclusion: 集成攻击网络训练策略有效增强了后处理水印方法的鲁棒性，为深度水印技术提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

TL;DR: LVLMs存在将文本输入误认为图像内容的幻觉问题，研究发现特定FFN神经元能识别视觉缺失，基于此开发了检测模块来改善输出质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理文本和视觉输入时，经常错误地将文本中缺乏视觉证据的概念误认为是图像内容，导致错误响应

Method: 发现并利用视觉缺失感知(VA)神经元的特定激活模式，开发检测模块来分类输入token是否具有视觉基础，通过重新解释问题提示或替换检测到的缺失token来优化输出

Result: 实验表明该方法有效缓解了模型错误假定文本输入视觉存在的倾向，并在多种LVLM中具有通用性

Conclusion: 通过识别和利用内部神经元模式，可以系统性地改善LVLMs的视觉-文本理解能力，减少幻觉错误

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Conclusion: 背景语义信息对ReID任务具有重要价值，联合建模前景和背景信息的双分支框架能有效提升模型性能

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: MedLiteNet通过创新的混合架构设计，成功解决了皮肤病变分割中全局上下文建模与计算效率之间的平衡问题，为小样本医学图像分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for
computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while
effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to
model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet
their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the
small-sample medical datasets common in dermatology. We introduce the
MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic
segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between
resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen
lesion contours.

Conclusion: 动态条件方法显著提升了多份务激洞模型的学习效果，特别是在训练数据缺乏的不良问题中表现优异。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and

classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to

cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CAIM-Net网络，通过从变化时刻推断变化区域，确保时间序列变化检测中变化区域和变化时刻结果的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法将变化区域检测和变化时刻识别作为独立任务处理，但变化区域可以从变化时刻推断出来，需要确保两者结果的一致性。

Method: CAIM-Net包含三个关键步骤：差异提取与增强、粗变化时刻提取、精细变化时刻提取与变化区域推断。使用轻量级编码器提取差异特征，通过边界增强卷积放大特征，进行时空相关性分析，最后利用多尺度时间CAM模块推断变化区域。

Result: 该方法通过从变化时刻推断变化区域，实现了变化检测任务中空间和时间维度结果的一致性。

Conclusion: CAIM-Net通过利用时间序列分析与空间变化检测之间的内在关系，提供了一种统一的变化检测框架，确保了变化区域和变化时刻检测结果的一致性。

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于梯度自反思的token影响估计方法，通过影响感知对比解码框架同时缓解多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差，无需额外资源即可有效减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法启发式地处理多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差，但缺乏对实例间波动偏差水平的理解，需要更精确的偏差缓解方法。

Method: 使用基于梯度的自反思方法估计不同类型token（视觉、提示、先前输出）的影响，检测目标相关视觉token，并将其整合到影响感知对比解码框架中。

Result: 在LLaVA-QA90上实现了高达92%的准确率提升，有效减少了幻觉现象，且无需额外微调、模型或数据统计资源。

Conclusion: 提出的梯度自反思和影响感知对比解码方法能够同时有效缓解多模态大语言模型中的两种主要偏差类型，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

TL;DR: 提出GravityDB方法，通过引力场驱动的扩散桥解决手-物体交互中的穿透、间隙和手部变形问题，生成物理合理且语义指导的交互效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手-物体姿态估计方法存在穿透、接触区域间隙问题，且难以捕捉手部在交互过程中的真实变形，需要更物理合理的方法来模拟可变形手部表面与刚性物体的交互。

Method: 将手-物体交互建模为引力场驱动过程，提出基于引力场的扩散桥(GravityDB)方法，通过语义文本信息指导引力场构建，生成无穿透、稳定抓取且包含真实手部变形的交互。

Result: 在多个数据集上的定性和定量实验证明了方法的有效性，能够生成物理合理的交互，避免穿透，确保稳定抓取，并捕捉真实的手部变形。

Conclusion: GravityDB方法成功解决了手-物体交互中的关键挑战，通过引力场驱动的扩散桥实现了物理合理且语义指导的交互模拟，为手-物体交互建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TADM-3D模型，使用3D扩散模型和脑龄估计器来预测MRI脑部结构随时间的变化，解决了现有方法在时间关系建模和3D上下文利用方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI预测方法存在三个主要问题：(1)无法明确捕捉结构变化与时间间隔的关系；(2)仅依赖扫描插值，缺乏临床实用性；(3)大多基于2D切片架构，忽略完整3D解剖上下文。需要开发能够准确预测脑部进展的3D方法。

Method: 提出TADM-3D模型：使用预训练的脑龄估计器(BAE)指导扩散模型生成反映预期年龄差异的MRI；引入Back-In-Time正则化(BITR)，通过双向训练（从基线到随访的前向预测和从随访到基线的后向预测）提高时间感知能力。

Result: 在OASIS-3数据集上训练和评估，并在NACC数据集的外部测试集上验证了泛化性能。

Conclusion: TADM-3D通过结合脑龄估计和双向正则化，能够生成更准确反映时间变化的3D MRI预测，为临床评估疾病进展提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学分割任务中，保持细长结构的连续性和长度比体素级精度更重要，特别是对于容易因信号丢失而产生不连续性的任务

Method: 提出了负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失两种新损失函数，结合CNN使用，并讨论了包括降尺度和间距校正在内的实验设计特征

Result: 与标准CNN和现有拓扑感知损失相比，新方法减少了每个实例的分割不连续性数量，特别是在输入信号缺失区域，改善了实例长度计算的准确性

Conclusion: 在损失函数设计中嵌入结构先验可以显著提高生物应用分割的可靠性

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

Motivation: 解决人群密度估计任务中需要精细位置标注的问题，传统方法依赖个体级别的点标注，收集耗时且难以扩展，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出Count2Density管道：1）使用历史地图库生成伪密度图，减少确认偏差；2）用无监督显著性估计器初始化空间先验；3）采用超几何分布采样生成伪密度图；4）添加自监督对比空间正则化器增强空间感知。

Conclusion: Count2Density能够有效地从计数级标注中提取空间信息，为人群密度估计提供了一种更实用的弱监督解决方案，各组件均被证明有效。

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Conclusion: 军事领域需要大型代表性数据集来进一步评估投毒攻击风险和补丁检测机会；AutoDetect方法为投毒检测提供了简单高效的解决方案；投毒攻击在实际应用中的可行性需要更多研究。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

Conclusion: 该方法为更安全和准确的低强度CT成像提供了有前景的解决方案，在多个数据集上都显示出优异的去噪性能和应用效果。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer

multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We
propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment
cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a
Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework
for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care,

Conclusion: RTGMFF通过多模态特征融合和文本生成技术，有效解决了fMRI诊断中的关键挑战，为脑部疾病诊断提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

Abstract: Organoids replicate organ structure and function, playing a crucial role in
fields such as tumor treatment and drug screening. Their shape and size can

introduced the LGBP-OrgaNet, a deep learning-based system proficient in
accurately segmenting, tracking, and quantifying organoids. The model leverages
complementary information extracted from CNN and Transformer modules and
introduces the innovative feature fusion module, Learnable Gaussian Band Pass
Fusion, to merge data from two branches. Additionally, in the decoder, the
model proposes a Bidirectional Cross Fusion Block to fuse multi-scale features,

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

TL;DR: 通过结合点云和像素信息，将CLIP的2D异常检测能力转移到3D领域，提出PointAD+框架来检测和分割未见对象的3D异常


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP在2D图像上的强大异常检测能力扩展到3D领域，解决在高度多样化类别语义的未见对象上进行3D异常检测的挑战

Method: 提出PointAD+统一框架：1）PointAD通过点-像素对应关系表征隐式3D异常；2）通过G-aggregation涵盖几何信息实现显式3D表征；3）层次表征学习结合隐式和显式异常语义；4）跨层次对比对齐促进层间交互

Result: 大量实验证明PointAD+在未见对象的零样本3D异常检测中表现优异，能够处理高度多样化类别语义，实现对异常的全面理解

Conclusion: PointAD+通过结合隐式和显式3D表征方法，成功将CLIP的2D通用能力转移到3D异常检测，为处理未见对象的3D异常检测问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索验证奖励强化学习在参数量少于70亿的轻量级多模态语言模型中的有效性，研究长链式思维数据对提升模型推理能力的作用

Method: 使用长链式思维数据进行监督微调，然后在SFT基础上进行强化学习训练

Result: 长链式思维数据的SFT显著提升MLLM推理能力，后续RL阶段可带来额外性能增益

Conclusion: 长链式思维数据的监督微调阶段是开发轻量级多模态语言模型推理能力的关键前提条件

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion是一个零样本框架，通过虚拟相机将砖石点云投影为深度图，并使用DDNM进行恢复，无需特定任务训练即可提升深度图的视觉清晰度和几何一致性，显著改善了砖块级分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低光照环境下（如砖石隧道），获取高分辨率RGB图像不切实际，而点云虽然对昏暗光照鲁棒，但通常是非结构化、稀疏且有噪声的，限制了细粒度分割。需要一种方法来解决砖块级分割的挑战。

Method: 提出InfraDiffusion框架：1）使用虚拟相机将砖石点云投影为深度图；2）采用Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM)进行恢复；3）无需任务特定训练；4）使用Segment Anything Model (SAM)进行砖块级分割。

Result: 在砖石桥梁和隧道点云数据集上的实验表明，该方法在砖块级分割方面取得了显著改进，提升了视觉清晰度和几何一致性。

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion展示了在砖石资产自动化检测方面的潜力，为零样本点云增强和分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法在高谱解混中难以同时特征化全局依赖性和局部一致性，导致长程交互和边界细节保持困难。

Method: 采用变换器捕捉全局依赖性，引入内容自适应图神经网络增强局部关系，集成多传播顺序动态学习图结构，并利用图殊徙机制保持全局信息。

Result: 实验结果证明该方法在噪声强健性和性能方面都超过了当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: T-CAGU框架通过结合变换器和图神经网络的优势，有效解决了高谱解混中的全局-局部单一性问题，为远感图像分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

Method: 提出TinyDrop训练免费token丢弃框架，通过轻量级视觉模型估计token重要性，选择性丢弃低重要性token，无需架构修改且兼容多种ViT

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，框架将ViT的FLOPs减少高达80%，精度退化极小

Conclusion: 该框架展示了泛化能力和实际效用，可用于高效的基于ViT的分类

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

Motivation: 现有评估方法对概念定制的评估要么过于狭窄要么过于泛化，与人类偏好存在偏差，特别是在多概念评估中难以准确评估概念间的交互作用

Method: 提出分解式GPT评分(D-GPTScore)，将评估标准分解为更细粒度的方面，并使用多模态大语言模型(MLLM)进行方面级评估；同时发布了包含单概念和多概念任务的CC-AlignBench基准数据集

Result: 该方法在基准测试中显著优于现有方法，与人类偏好的相关性更高

Conclusion: 这项工作为概念定制评估建立了新标准，并指出了未来研究的关键挑战

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

Conclusion: 该框架不仅在乳腺癌分子分型中表现优异，而且具有良好的扩展性，可以轻松整合额外模态，适用于其他类型的癌症。双重WSI表示方法和新的多模态融合策略带来了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

Motivation: 现有密集视频描述方法在处理长视频时遇到计算复杂性和内存限制问题，且需要整个视频作为输入才能输出结果，无法支持在线处理。

Method: 提出带有转移状态的状态空间模型(SSMs)，结合SSMs的长序列和递归特性，解决SSMs在很长上下文中无法维持状态的主要限制。

Result: 方法特别适合在线流式生成描述，无需等待整个视频处理完成。在密集视频描述任务中，消耗FLOPs减少7倍，且能够良好地适应不同视频长度。

Conclusion: 该研究通过时间缩放SSMs技术，有效解决了长视频处理的计算挑战，实现了高效的在线密集视频描述，具有重要的实践价值。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

Conclusion: 多模态融合框架有效提升了从EEG信号解码视觉神经表征的性能，文本模态的引入显著增强了语义对应关系

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

Conclusion: JTGD方法在保持高性能的同时大幅减少计算资源需求，非常适合在实际边缘设备上部署应用。

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models

these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

Method: 使用数据引擎伪标注时间密集的细粒度视频元数据，以结构化方式捕获丰富的空间和时间信息，包括主体、对象、位置掩码、动作描述和时间线，生成多样化的指令调优数据。

Result: 实验评估显示，使用Strefer生成数据训练的模型在需要时空消歧的任务上优于基线模型，并展现出增强的空间时间感知推理能力。

Conclusion: Strefer为感知基础的指令调优视频大语言模型建立了新的基础，能够提升AI伴侣在现实世界环境中的时空参考解析能力。

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

Motivation: 目前缺乏研究笔迹遗传性的数据库，需要创建能够回答笔迹是否具有遗传成分、家族关系是否影响笔迹等问题的数据集

Method: 收集210个家庭（包括祖父母、父母、叔叔阿姨、兄弟姐妹、堂表亲等）的手写样本，包括数字、字母、形状和自由段落，使用专门设计的表格记录家庭关系

Result: 通过比较家庭成员笔迹特征，检测到他们之间的书写风格和特征相似性，创建了首个此类数据库

Conclusion: 该数据库免费提供给模式识别社区，将为研究遗传和家庭关系对笔迹的影响铺平道路

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation
on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that
can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to
handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

TL;DR: T2I-CoReBench是一个全面的文本到图像生成基准测试，通过12维评估分类法评估模型的组合和推理能力，包含1080个复杂提示和13500个检查问题，发现当前模型在复杂场景中的组合能力有限，推理能力更是瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I基准测试在评估组合和推理能力方面存在局限性，无法全面评估模型在这些核心能力上的表现，且无法处理高场景密度和多步推理的复杂提示。

Method: 构建基于场景图元素（实例、属性、关系）的组合评估和基于哲学推理框架（演绎、归纳、溯因）的推理评估，形成12维评估分类法，创建高组合密度和多步推理的复杂提示，并为每个提示配备检查清单进行细粒度评估。

Result: 对27个当前T2I模型的实验表明，模型在复杂高密度场景中的组合能力仍然有限，推理能力更是严重滞后，所有模型都难以从提示中推断隐含元素。

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench提供了一个全面复杂的基准测试，揭示了当前T2I模型在组合和推理能力上的局限性，特别是推理能力成为关键瓶颈，需要进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.
