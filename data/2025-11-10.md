*Ali Faraz,Akash,Shaharukh Khan,Raja Kolla,Akshat Patidar,Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicVisionBench是首个以印度次大陆为中心的大规模多模态基准测试，涵盖英语和10种印度语言，包含OCR、MMT和VQA三个任务，包含约5K图像和37K+问答对，评估了8个模型并揭示了现有VLMs在文化多样性环境中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数多模态评估基准都是西方中心的，缺乏对文化多样性和多语言环境的评估，需要专门针对印度次大陆的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 构建IndicVisionBench基准，涵盖英语和10种印度语言，包含OCR、多模态机器翻译和视觉问答三个任务，覆盖13个文化相关主题，包含约5K图像和37K+问答对。

Result: 评估了8个模型（从专有闭源系统到开源权重模型），发现现有VLMs在文化多样性环境中存在显著的性能差距。

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench建立了一个可复现的评估框架，为更包容的多模态研究铺平了道路，强调了文化多样性和多语言性的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

### [2] [Knowledge-based anomaly detection for identifying network-induced shape artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04729)
*Rucha Deshpande,Tahsin Rahman,Miguel Lago,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Jana G. Delfino,Ghada Zamzmi,Elim Thompson,Aldo Badano,Seyed Kahaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识的异常检测方法，用于检测合成医学图像中的网络诱导形状伪影，通过两阶段框架（特征提取器和隔离森林检测器）在合成乳腺X光图像上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据虽然能解决训练数据稀缺问题，但未经质量评估可能导致伪影和失真，影响模型性能和临床实用性，需要检测网络诱导的形状伪影。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）新型特征提取器，通过分析解剖边界角度梯度的每图像分布构建专用特征空间；2）基于隔离森林的异常检测器。

Result: 在两个合成乳腺X光数据集上，方法成功将伪影集中在最异常分区（第1百分位），AUC值分别为0.97和0.91。读者研究显示与人类读者平均一致率达66%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了合成数据的负责任使用，使开发者能够根据已知解剖约束评估合成图像，定位并解决特定问题以提高合成数据集质量。

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [3] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Condition Preference Optimization (CPO)方法，通过在控制条件而非生成图像上进行偏好学习，解决了传统DPO方法在文本到图像生成中难以确保图像对仅在可控性上存在差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet++仅优化低噪声时间步，忽略了高噪声时间步的贡献并引入近似误差；而DPO方法由于生成模型的不确定性，难以确保图像对仅在可控性上存在差异。

Method: 提出CPO方法，构建获胜和失败的控制信号(c^w和c^l)，训练模型偏好c^w，消除混杂因素并获得低方差训练目标。

Result: CPO在多个控制类型上显著优于ControlNet++：分割错误率降低超过10%，人体姿态错误率降低70-80%，边缘和深度图错误率一致降低2-5%。

Conclusion: CPO方法在理论上比DPO具有更低的对比损失方差，在计算和存储需求上更高效，能显著提升文本到图像生成的可控性。

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [4] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARN是一种动态自适应正则化网络，通过任务复杂度预测器、自适应dropout调制和动态容量门控来解决卫星图像异质性挑战，在完整微调和高效适应两种范式下都取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型为地理空间分析提供了强大的表示能力，但标准适应方法采用固定正则化策略的解码器，无法应对卫星图像的显著异质性，限制了模型的适应效果。

Method: DARN集成了三个关键创新：轻量级任务复杂度预测器、基于预测复杂度动态调整dropout率（0.1-0.5）的自适应dropout调制、以及调节通道激活的动态容量门控。

Result: 在完整微调模式下，DARN在GeoBench基准上达到86.66% mIoU的新SOTA（比之前SOTA提升5.56个百分点）；在高效适应模式下，在Sen1Floods11上达到90.5% mIoU，并在OOD泛化、鲁棒性和少数类性能方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DARN为关键地理空间应用中利用基础模型提供了一种更智能、鲁棒和高效的方法，通过动态自适应机制有效解决了卫星图像的异质性挑战。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

*Shirin Ermis,Cesar Aybar,Lilli Freischem,Stella Girtsou,Kyriaki-Margarita Bintsi,Emiliano Diaz Salas-Porras,Michael Eisinger,William Jones,Anna Jungbluth,Benoit Tremblay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于预训练-微调框架的新方法，利用多卫星全球观测数据将2D卫星图像转换为3D云图，首次实现全球瞬时3D云图生成，并能准确重建强风暴的3D结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热带气旋(TC)预报因卫星观测有限和云属性解析困难而具有挑战性，现有机器学习方法局限于TC罕见区域且对强风暴验证不足。

Method: 采用预训练-微调流程，从多卫星全球覆盖数据中学习，将2D卫星图像转换为相关云属性的3D云图，并在定制TC数据集上评估性能。

Result: 首次创建全球瞬时3D云图，准确重建强风暴的3D结构，不仅扩展了可用卫星观测，还能在观测完全缺失时提供估计。

Conclusion: 该方法对于推进TC强化过程理解和改进预报至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

*Andrea Aspesi,Andrea Simpsi,Aaron Tognoli,Simone Mentasti,Luca Merigo,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EETnet，一种基于事件数据的眼动追踪卷积神经网络，能够在资源受限的微控制器上运行，并提供了训练、评估和量化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件相机的眼动追踪方案大多依赖强大的GPU，无法在实际嵌入式设备上部署，需要开发能在资源受限设备上运行的高效解决方案。

Method: 设计了两种架构版本：分类模型在网格上检测瞳孔位置，回归模型在像素级别进行操作；使用公开数据集进行训练、评估和网络量化。

Result: 开发出了能够在微控制器上运行的EETnet网络，实现了基于纯事件数据的眼动追踪。

Conclusion: 成功证明了基于事件相机的眼动追踪系统可以在资源受限的嵌入式设备上实现，为低功耗眼动追踪应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

### [7] [3D Gaussian Point Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04797)
*Jim James,Ben Wilson,Simon Lucey,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出3D高斯点编码器，这是一种基于学习3D高斯混合的显式逐点嵌入表示，相比传统PointNet等隐式表示具有更快的速度和更高的参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D识别任务主要使用PointNet等隐式表示，但显式几何表示在3D重建领域已显示出优势。本文旨在将这种从隐式到显式的转变引入3D识别任务，开发更高效的表示方法。

Method: 基于自然梯度和从PointNet蒸馏的优化技术，学习能够重建PointNet激活的高斯基。扩展3D高斯泼溅的滤波技术，进一步加速编码器。

Result: 3D高斯点编码器比可比精度PointNet快2.7倍，内存减少46%，FLOPs减少88%。在Mamba3D中组件应用时，速度快1.27倍，内存和FLOPs分别减少42%和54%。

Conclusion: 3D高斯点编码器提供了一种轻量级的显式几何表示，能够在仅CPU设备上实现高帧率，为3D识别任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

### [8] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究系统分析了生物医学图像分割模型的数据冗余和跨域遗忘问题。通过数据集量化策略发现仅需10%数据即可达到饱和性能，并证明选择性重放5-10%源数据可有效缓解跨域遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学图像分割中两个关键挑战：训练数据冗余程度和跨域迁移对模型保留能力的影响。

Method: 使用Cellpose作为案例研究，提出数据集量化策略构建紧凑训练子集，进行跨域微调实验和选择性重放策略，分析潜在空间特征。

Result: 图像分割性能在仅使用10%数据时达到饱和；跨域微调导致源域性能显著下降；选择性重放5-10%源数据可恢复源性能；训练域排序改善泛化能力。

Conclusion: 生物医学图像分割需要数据为中心的设计，高效训练不仅需要紧凑数据子集，还需要保留感知学习策略和合理的域排序。

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available
at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/biomedseg-efficiency.

### [9] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合主动学习和伪标记的数据中心化AI工作流，用于生物医学图像分割，减少人工标注需求的同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决nnU-Net需要大量标注数据进行交叉验证的问题，以及大型基础模型在特定数据集上性能不足的限制。

Method: 使用基础模型生成伪标签用于nnU-Net自配置，然后通过主动学习选择代表性样本进行最小化人工标注，最后微调nnU-Net模型。

Result: 显著减少了人工标注需求，同时保持了有竞争力的分割性能。

Conclusion: 为生物医学研究人员提供了一种可访问的解决方案，能够在分割任务中应用最先进的AI技术。

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/AL_BioMed_img_seg.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于表面法向量先验知识的几何去噪新方法，通过标签向量集进行自然分割，使用总变差正则化和分裂Bregman方法求解优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用表面法向量的先验知识来改进几何去噪，通过标签向量集嵌入自然分割过程，结合正则化提升去噪效果。

Method: 使用标签向量集作为法向量先验，基于法向量相似性进行分割，采用总变差正则化，通过分裂Bregman（ADMM）方法求解优化问题，顶点更新基于二阶形状计算。

Result: 该方法能够有效进行几何去噪，同时实现基于法向量的自然分割，优化问题通过分裂Bregman方法高效求解。

Conclusion: 提出的基于法向量先验知识的几何去噪方法结合了分割和正则化，通过分裂Bregman优化框架实现了有效的几何处理。

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从不规则点云恢复高质量表面是病态问题，需要强几何先验。传统方法依赖外部训练数据，而本文直接从输入点云本身提取形状特定先验。

Method: 联合训练可学习嵌入字典与隐式距离场，通过交叉注意力机制捕获形状的重复结构和长程相关性；使用自监督点云重建损失优化；结合RIMLS公式集成稠密点云和法向量。

Result: 实验表明该方法在生成高保真表面方面优于传统和基于学习的方法，具有更好的细节保持能力和对数据退化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的隐式自先验方法能够直接从输入点云学习形状特定先验，无需外部数据即可实现高质量表面重建，在细节保持和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Clinical-ComBAT方法，用于解决DW-MRI数据在多站点临床应用中存在的扫描仪特异性偏差问题，相比传统ComBAT方法具有更好的灵活性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DW-MRI数据在多站点研究中存在扫描仪特异性偏差，传统ComBAT方法依赖线性协变量关系、同质人群、固定站点数量等假设，限制了其在临床环境中的应用。

Method: 开发了Clinical-ComBAT方法，采用非线性多项式数据模型，以规范站点为参考进行站点特异性协调，包含可适应小队列的方差先验、超参数调优和协调评估的拟合优度指标。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上验证了方法的有效性，显示扩散指标对齐得到改善，规范建模的适用性增强。

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT方法能够有效解决多站点DW-MRI数据协调问题，特别适用于现实临床场景，具有更好的灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

*James Ndubuisi,Fernando Auat,Marta Vallejo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了Swin Transformer在耳科疾病诊断中的效果，发现初始结果很好但存在数据泄露问题，修正后性能显著下降，强调了医疗机器学习中数据处理的严谨性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耳科疾病误诊率高达27%，需要提高诊断准确性。研究旨在比较视觉Transformer与传统CNN在耳科疾病诊断中的表现。

Method: 使用智利大学临床医院耳鼻喉科的真实耳镜视频数据集，基于拉普拉斯和香农熵阈值选择帧，去除空白帧。比较Swin v1、Swin v2 Transformer和ResNet模型。

Result: 初始结果：Swin v1 100%、Swin v2 99.1%、ResNet 99.5%，但发现数据泄露问题。修正后准确率：Swin v1和v2均为83%，ResNet为82%。

Conclusion: 视觉Transformer有潜力，但需要在先进模型架构和有效数据预处理之间找到平衡，这对开发可靠的耳科疾病诊断模型至关重要。

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%
misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic
accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

*Ahmad Elallaf,Nathan Jacobs,Xinyue Ye,Mei Chen,Gongbo Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卫星图像的地理空间深度学习框架，用于预测致命交通事故风险，通过Beta概率分布提供不确定性感知的预测，在召回率上比基线方法提升17-23%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通安全研究孤立分析风险因素，忽略空间复杂性；传统神经网络风险估计器缺乏不确定性量化，限制了在关键决策中的实用性。

Method: 利用卫星图像作为综合空间输入，构建地理空间深度学习框架，估计致命事故风险的完整Beta概率分布而非单一确定性输出。

Result: 模型在召回率指标上比基线方法提升17-23%，提供更好的校准性能，能够可靠地从卫星图像中识别潜在危险。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶提供更安全的导航支持，为城市规划者和政策制定者提供可扩展的工具，以公平且经济高效的方式提升道路安全。

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应多退化图像恢复网络IMDNet，通过解耦退化成分来指导路径选择，能够处理多种共存退化问题，在单退化和多退化任务中都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像往往同时存在多种退化（如雨、噪声、雾霾），而现有方法大多只针对单一退化类型，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 设计了退化成分解耦块（DIDBlock）在编码器中分离退化成分，融合块（FBlock）整合多层级退化信息，任务适应块（TABlock）在解码器中动态激活或融合功能分支。

Result: 在多个退化恢复任务中表现出优越性能，同时在单退化任务中保持强大竞争力。

Conclusion: IMDNet通过紧密集成的架构有效解决了多退化图像恢复问题，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Motivation: 口腔医疗AI的发展需要大规模多模态数据集来捕捉临床实践的复杂性，但目前缺乏这样的公开资源。

Method: 收集了8年间的牙科检查数据，包括图像和文本记录，并使用这些数据微调Qwen-VL 3B和7B模型，评估其在口腔异常分类和诊断报告生成任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 该数据集为AI牙科研究提供了重要资源，能够有效推动AI驱动的口腔医疗解决方案的发展。

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual
records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data
were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for
benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large
vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks:
classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The
dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future
research in AI dentistry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高维潜在空间表示和多智能体对抗强化学习(MAARL)的新型深度学习框架，用于开发鲁棒且自适应的水印方法，以解决深度伪造检测中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的快速发展导致深度伪造越来越逼真，现有被动检测器难以跟上发展步伐，而主动水印检测方法在鲁棒性和敏感性之间难以平衡。

Method: 开发了在潜在空间中操作的可学习水印嵌入器，利用MAARL范式让水印智能体通过与对抗攻击智能体模拟的良性/恶意图像操作交互，寻找鲁棒性和脆弱性之间的最优平衡。

Result: 在CelebA和CelebA-HQ基准测试中，该方法始终优于最先进方法，在具有挑战性的操作场景下分别实现了超过4.5%和5.3%的改进。

Conclusion: 该框架通过高维潜在空间表示和MAARL范式，成功开发出能够平衡鲁棒性和敏感性的自适应水印方法，为深度伪造检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

TL;DR: CLM系统通过将高斯分布数据卸载到CPU内存，仅在需要时加载到GPU内存，使3D高斯溅射(3DGS)能够在单个消费级GPU上渲染大型场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS虽然渲染速度快、输出质量高，但在处理大型或复杂场景时内存需求巨大，超过了大多数GPU的内存容量。

Method: 利用3DGS内存访问模式的观察，采用流水线化的卸载策略，重叠GPU-CPU通信、GPU计算和CPU计算，同时减少通信量。

Result: 在单个RTX4090上成功渲染需要1亿个高斯分布的大型场景，并达到最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: CLM系统有效解决了3DGS在大场景渲染中的内存限制问题，使其能够在消费级硬件上运行。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: 提出了PDS方法，用于解决fMRI和dMRI模态缺失问题，通过模式感知的双模态3D扩散框架和组织细化网络，在跨模态学习中实现高质量的图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI和dMRI在神经退行性疾病研究中至关重要，但模态缺失限制了其临床应用。现有GAN和扩散模型方法在fMRI-dMRI合成中存在信号差异大和疾病相关神经解剖模式整合不足的问题。

Method: PDS方法包含两个关键创新：(1) 模式感知的双模态3D扩散框架进行跨模态学习；(2) 结合高效微结构细化的组织细化网络，以保持结构保真度和精细细节。

Result: 在OASIS-3、ADNI和内部数据集上的评估显示，PDS达到最先进水平：fMRI合成的PSNR/SSIM为29.83 dB/90.84%，dMRI合成达到30.00 dB/77.55%。临床验证中，合成数据在混合真实-合成实验中达到67.92%/66.02%/64.15%的准确率（NC vs. MCI vs. AD）。

Conclusion: PDS方法有效解决了fMRI-dMRI模态合成中的挑战，在图像质量和临床诊断性能方面均表现出色，为神经退行性疾病的MRI研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic
experiments. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/SXR3015/PDS}{PDS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个可微分框架，通过傅里叶级数参数化任意形状，使用基于环绕数的映射将形状转换为DNN所需的像素网格，并利用信号能量约束来优化形状，从而探索深度神经网络的几何理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的研究主要集中在纹理理解上，而对其几何理解能力的探索相对不足。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究形状如何作为语义载体影响DNN的识别能力。

Method: 开发了一个端到端的可微分框架，包含三个核心组件：1）使用傅里叶级数参数化任意形状；2）基于环绕数的映射方法将形状转换为像素网格；3）信号能量约束来增强优化效率并确保物理上合理的形状。

Result: 研究发现：1）优化的形状可以作为有效的语义载体，仅凭几何信息就能产生高置信度的分类；2）这些形状是高质量的可解释性工具，能精确识别模型的关键区域；3）构成了新的通用对抗范式，能够欺骗下游视觉任务。

Conclusion: 该工作为探索DNN的几何世界提供了一个多功能框架，并为挑战和理解机器感知开辟了新前沿。

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了用于拓扑数据分析模型训练和评估的标记3D数据集的空白，强调了拓扑和几何复杂性对模型泛化能力的影响。

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

Conclusion: 通过发布Triple-S和GSE，为贴纸理解、检索和多模态内容生成提供了标准化评估工具和鲁棒嵌入表示，推动了该领域的未来研究。

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are
available here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现主流LVLM架构存在固有的语言模态偏见，这主要是由于将视觉嵌入简单附加到输入文本序列的常见做法导致的。

Method: 通过整合平均池化的视觉特征来精炼文本嵌入，这是一种简单但有效的方法。

Result: 在已建立的基准测试中显著改善了视觉定位，并显著减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 虽然平均池化提供了一种简单、稳健且高效的视觉信息整合方式，但更复杂的融合方法可能进一步改善视觉定位和跨模态对齐，这留待未来研究。

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

TL;DR: 提出DRE-SLCL方法，通过动态残差编码和切片级对比学习实现全切片图像(WSI)的端到端表示学习，解决了GPU内存限制下无法同时处理所有图像块的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像(WSI)表示对癌症亚型分类、癌症识别和突变预测至关重要，但由于单个切片包含数万个图像块，受GPU限制无法在单个小批量中计算所有块的梯度。

Method: 使用内存库存储所有WSI的图块特征，训练时随机采样部分图块计算特征，并从内存库中检索同一WSI的额外特征，通过残差编码技术结合采样特征和检索特征生成WSI表示，最后基于小批量内WSI的表示和病理报告计算切片级对比损失。

Result: 在癌症亚型分类、癌症识别和突变预测任务上的实验证明了DRE-SLCL方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL方法能够有效解决WSI端到端表示学习中的计算挑战，在多个癌症相关任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

Motivation: 解决传统运动捕捉需要专业设备（如摄像头、可穿戴设备）的限制，提供在隐私保护、低光照和低成本条件下的运动捕捉方案。由于压力信号到全身运动的不确定性，该任务具有严重的不适定性。

Method: 提出Pressure2Motion生成模型，使用压力特征作为输入，文本提示作为高级约束。采用双级特征提取器准确解释压力数据，然后使用分层扩散模型识别大尺度运动轨迹和细微姿态调整。

Result: 实验表明该方法能生成高保真、物理合理的运动，在该任务上建立了新的最先进水平。建立了MPL基准，是该任务的第一个基准。

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion是利用压力数据和语言先验进行运动生成的先驱工作，代码和基准将在发表后公开。

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

Motivation: 现有的医学参考图像分割方法通常涉及复杂的多模态融合或多阶段解码器设计，作者希望提出一个更简化的框架来替代传统流程。

Method: 提出NTP-MRISeg框架，将MRIS重新定义为多模态序列的自回归下一令牌预测任务；引入三种新策略：下一k令牌预测减少累积误差、令牌级对比学习增强边界敏感性、基于记忆的困难令牌优化策略。

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg为传统MRIS流程提供了一个简化和有效的替代方案，展示了自回归令牌预测在医学图像分割中的潜力。

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

*Mingyu Sung,Hyeonmin Choe,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PITTA框架，一种用于单目深度估计的测试时自适应方法，通过姿态无关的自适应范式和实例感知图像掩码，在无需相机姿态信息的情况下实现高效的自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目深度估计模型在实际部署中遇到的环境条件变化问题，现有测试时自适应方法在多样化和动态环境中效果不佳。

Method: 采用姿态无关的测试时自适应范式，结合实例感知图像掩码技术，从全景分割网络中提取动态对象掩码，并引入边缘提取方法增强性能。

Result: 在DrivingStereo和Waymo数据集上的实验表明，PITTA框架显著超越了现有最先进技术，在测试时自适应中实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PITTA框架通过创新的姿态无关自适应和实例感知掩码策略，有效解决了单目深度估计在动态环境中的测试时自适应挑战。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

*Yuanxiang Huangfu,Chaochao Wang,Weilei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Role-SynthCLIP是一个通过多视角角色扮演提示来增强CLIP模型训练数据语义多样性的框架，在保持数据量不变的情况下显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法主要关注增加数据量，但往往导致语义多样性有限和标题冗余浅显，需要提升数据质量而非数量。

Method: 使用多视角角色扮演提示（如组合分析师、图像上下文解释者）引导多模态大语言模型从不同视角生成语义多样的标题，增强图像-文本对齐的细粒度。

Result: 仅用100万Role-SynthCLIP数据对训练的CLIP-B/16模型在MS COCO验证集上达到64.1%的Recall@1，比现有最佳合成数据基线（500万对）高出2.8个百分点。

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP通过多视角角色提示机制有效提升了合成数据的语义多样性和质量，在更少数据量下实现了更好的CLIP模型性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

*Mingyu Sheng,Jianan Fan,Dongnan Liu,Guoyan Zheng,Ron Kikinis,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SurgiATM手术烟雾去除方法，将物理大气模型与深度学习模型结合，作为轻量级即插即用模块提升现有去烟方法的准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腹腔镜手术中组织烧灼产生的烟雾会显著降低内窥镜图像质量，增加手术风险，影响临床决策和计算机视觉分析，因此需要有效去除手术烟雾。

Method: SurgiATM通过统计方法桥接基于物理的大气模型和数据驱动的深度学习模型，结合前者的泛化能力和后者的高精度，设计为轻量级即插即用模块，仅引入两个超参数且无额外可训练权重。

Result: 在三个公共手术数据集和十种去烟方法上的实验表明，集成SurgiATM能普遍降低现有模型的恢复误差，相对提升其泛化能力，且不增加可训练层或权重。

Conclusion: SurgiATM方法具有便利性、低成本、有效性和良好泛化性，能够无缝集成到各种手术去烟架构中，更好地满足临床需求。

Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at
https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/SurgiATM.

TL;DR: 研究发现对抗样本对遮挡高度敏感，提出SMCE指标量化遮挡下模型置信度波动，并基于此开发SWM-AED检测方法，在CIFAR-10上取得良好检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解对抗样本与干净样本的内在差异对于增强DNN鲁棒性和对抗攻击检测至关重要。研究发现图像对抗样本对遮挡特别敏感。

Method: 在CIFAR-10上使用9种典型攻击生成对抗样本，引入滑动掩码置信度熵(SMCE)量化遮挡下的模型置信度波动，提出滑动窗口掩码对抗样本检测(SWM-AED)方法。

Result: 使用1800+测试图像，SMCE计算显示对抗样本在遮挡下的置信度波动显著高于原始样本。SWM-AED在CIFAR-10上检测准确率在多数情况下超过62%，最高达96.5%。

Conclusion: 对抗样本对遮挡的敏感性可作为有效检测特征，SWM-AED方法避免了传统对抗训练的灾难性过拟合，展现出稳健的检测性能。

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean
samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial
attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial
examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10
used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples,
paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask
Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under
occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy
Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have
significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals.
Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example
Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional
adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10
demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to
96.5%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DPPP双阶段提示驱动隐私保护范式，通过生成多样化虚拟数据和提示驱动解耦机制，解决行人重识别中数据隐私和领域泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据隐私问题日益严重，现有虚拟数据集存在构建复杂和领域泛化能力差的问题，难以在实际场景中应用。

Method: 第一阶段：生成包含多维度属性的丰富提示，驱动扩散模型端到端合成多样化数据，构建GenePerson虚拟数据集（130,519张图像，6,641个身份）。第二阶段：提出提示驱动解耦机制，通过两个文本反转网络将图像映射为风格和内容的伪词表示，构建风格解耦的内容提示来学习领域不变特征。

Result: 在GenePerson数据集上使用PDM训练的模型实现了最先进的泛化性能，超过了在流行真实和虚拟Re-ID数据集上训练的模型。

Conclusion: DPPP范式有效解决了行人重识别中的隐私保护和领域泛化问题，为隐私敏感场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

Motivation: 恶劣天气严重损害真实世界的视觉感知，而现有基于合成数据训练的视觉模型难以泛化到复杂的退化情况。

Method: 构建HFLS-Weather物理驱动高保真数据集，设计双层次强化学习框架：局部层次通过扰动驱动的图像质量优化精炼天气特定恢复模型，全局层次使用元控制器根据场景退化动态编排模型选择和执行顺序。

Result: 该框架实现了对真实世界条件的持续适应，在多种恶劣天气场景下达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的双层次强化学习框架能够有效应对恶劣天气条件下的视觉感知挑战，实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究首次应用深度学习直接对原始OCT B扫描图像进行阿尔茨海默病早期检测，通过微调预训练模型并使用UK Biobank数据，ResNet-34在4年队列中达到AUC 0.62，为OCT-based AD预测提供了基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜层厚度变化与神经退行性疾病相关，但以往研究主要关注分割层厚度测量。本研究探索直接对OCT B扫描图像进行分类，实现AD的早期检测，这是文献中首次将深度学习应用于原始OCT B扫描进行AD预测。

Method: 微调并评估多个预训练模型，包括基于ImageNet的网络和OCT特定的RETFound transformer，使用UK Biobank队列中年龄、性别和成像实例匹配的受试者级交叉验证数据集。应用标准和OCT特定的数据增强技术，以及优先考虑成像后4年内诊断病例的年份加权损失函数。

Result: ResNet-34产生最稳定的结果，在4年队列中达到AUC 0.62。虽然低于临床应用阈值，但可解释性分析确认了AD组和对照组在中央黄斑亚区存在局部结构差异。

Conclusion: 这些发现为基于OCT的AD预测提供了基准，突出了在AD诊断前数年检测细微视网膜生物标志物的挑战，并指出需要更大的数据集和多模态方法。

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in
all-weather autonomous driving. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 解决电影制作中因预算限制导致的稀疏相机配置问题，现有方法在捕捉复杂动态特征时性能受限。

Method: 将规范高斯和变形场分成前景和背景组件，使用t=0帧的稀疏掩码集，每个表示在规范预训练期间使用不同的损失函数单独训练，动态训练中为每个变形场建模不同参数。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从稀疏多视角视频中实现高质量的动态3D重建，同时产生分割的动态重建结果，包括透明和动态纹理。

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DINOv3等视觉基础模型在高分辨率下计算密集和计算复杂度高的问题，这些模型需要高分辨率输入和大量计算资源。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏方法，训练学生模型学习在更高分辨率下重现自己的特征图，从而降低计算成本。

Result: BRIXEL在固定分辨率下大幅超越基线DINOv3模型，能生成与教师模型相似的特征图，但计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: BRIXEL通过简单的知识蒸馏方法有效解决了高分辨率特征图计算成本高的问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算需求。

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code
and model weights are available at https://github.com/alexanderlappe/BRIXEL.

Conclusion: MUSE有效解决了病理学细胞核检测与分类的核心挑战，能够充分利用未标记病理图像的价值。

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image
segmentation.

Conclusion: FreeControl为测试时控制引入了新范式，无需反转或重新训练即可实现高效、灵活的结构和语义控制，在保持高质量的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

TL;DR: 4D3R是一个无需相机位姿的动态神经渲染框架，通过两阶段方法分离静态和动态组件，在动态场景新视角合成方面取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单目视频进行动态场景新视角合成的挑战，现有方法如NeRF和3DGS在动态内容和未知相机位姿情况下表现不佳。

Method: 两阶段方法：首先使用3D基础模型进行初始位姿和几何估计，然后通过运动感知细化。关键技术包括运动感知束调整模块和高效的运动感知高斯溅射表示。

Result: 在真实世界动态数据集上，PSNR比现有最优方法提升高达1.8dB，在包含大型动态物体的挑战性场景中表现优异，计算需求减少5倍。

Conclusion: 4D3R在动态场景新视角合成方面实现了显著性能提升和计算效率改进，为未知相机位姿的动态场景渲染提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专门为工业异常检测设计的预训练表示学习框架，通过角度和范数导向的对比损失最大化正常与异常特征之间的差异，在大型异常检测数据集上进行预训练以解决分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的异常检测方法依赖于ImageNet预训练特征，但ImageNet预训练与异常检测目标不匹配，且自然图像与工业图像存在分布偏移，导致特征次优。需要专门为异常检测任务设计的预训练表示。

Method: 提出角度和范数导向的对比损失，同时最大化正常与异常特征之间的角度大小和范数差异；在大型异常检测数据集RealIAD上进行预训练；基于类泛化表示学习残差特征。

Result: 在五个异常检测数据集和五个骨干网络上进行广泛实验，使用五种基于嵌入的异常检测方法，仅替换原始特征为本文预训练表示，结果均显示优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的专门为异常检测设计的预训练表示学习框架能有效学习到鲁棒且具有判别性的特征，显著提升异常检测性能。

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线连续动作识别在现实应用中更实用，但现有骨架方法多关注分段识别，不适合在线场景。需要开发能够实时处理骨架序列流的系统。

Conclusion: 提出的在线识别系统能够连续识别动力学状态，在未分割序列中准确预测动作时间区间并识别动作，在现实应用中具有良好性能。

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

TL;DR: 使用裁剪3D U-Net自动分割结直肠肝转移瘤，在术中超声中实现接近实时的可靠分割，显著提高手术导航效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中准确界定结直肠肝转移瘤对实现阴性切缘至关重要，但术中超声由于低对比度、噪声和操作者依赖性而具有挑战性，自动分割可提高超声导航工作流程的精度和效率

Method: 使用85例患者的追踪3D术中超声数据，通过nnU-Net框架实现3D U-Net，比较完整体积和裁剪肿瘤区域两种训练方式，评估Dice系数、Hausdorff距离和相对体积差异等指标

Result: 裁剪体积模型在所有指标上显著优于完整体积模型（AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718），中位DSC=0.74，召回率=0.79，Hausdorff距离=17.1mm，执行速度快约4倍（约1分钟），前瞻性测试证实稳健性能

Conclusion: 基于裁剪3D U-Net的自动3D分割方法提供可靠、接近实时的结果，无需配准即可实现高效的超声导航，接近专家级准确性，同时显著减少手动工作量和手术时间

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

object detection models on the dataset and leverage their predictions for
fine-grained, episode-level analysis of character presence over time. This
approach reveals patterns of character prominence and their evolution within
the narrative. By emphasizing appearance frequency, OregairuChar serves as a
valuable resource for exploring computational narrative dynamics and
character-centric storytelling in stylized media.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepEyesV2是一个代理式多模态模型，通过两阶段训练（冷启动+强化学习）实现稳健的工具调用行为，在真实世界理解、数学推理和搜索密集型任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建能够主动调用外部工具（如代码执行环境和网络搜索）并将这些操作整合到推理中的代理式多模态模型。

Method: 采用两阶段训练管道：冷启动阶段建立工具使用模式，强化学习阶段进一步优化工具调用；构建多样化、适度挑战的训练数据集；引入RealX-Bench评估基准。

Result: DeepEyesV2在RealX-Bench和其他代表性基准测试中表现出色，能够根据任务自适应地调用工具，在感知任务中倾向于使用图像操作，在推理任务中倾向于数值计算。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练方法能够有效诱导稳健的工具使用行为，强化学习支持复杂的工具组合和基于上下文的工具选择，为开发代理式多模态模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自我报告方法存在回忆偏差，基于摄像头的方法有隐私担忧，现有可穿戴方法主要针对有限食物类型（如汉堡、披萨），无法应对中国菜系的多样性。

Method: 设计两阶段检测流程：第一阶段通过区分特征性时间模式识别饮食状态；第二阶段基于进食过程中的动作进行细粒度食物类型识别。结合智能手表的手部动作和智能眼镜的头部动态数据。

Result: 构建了包含27.5小时IMU记录的数据集，涵盖11个食物类别和10名参与者。实验表明CuisineSense在饮食状态检测和食物分类方面均达到高准确率。

Conclusion: CuisineSense为无干扰、基于可穿戴设备的饮食监测提供了实用解决方案，系统代码已公开。

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for
offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to
simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal
response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative
coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering
live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through
adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a
training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for
variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across
dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework
that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass
verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for
online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache
to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a
comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse
real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding.
Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in
semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing
online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

Motivation: 随着3D点云技术的重要性日益增长，需要更可靠的生成模型评估指标。现有基于Chamfer Distance的指标对缺陷不鲁棒，无法准确捕捉几何保真度和局部形状一致性。

Method: 提出了两个关键改进：在距离计算前引入样本对齐，用Density-Aware Chamfer Distance替代传统CD；提出了新的Surface Normal Concordance指标通过比较点法向量来评估表面相似性；开发了Diffusion Point Transformer架构，利用transformer模型进行点云生成。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估指标和开发新的生成架构，本文为3D点云生成提供了更可靠的评估框架和更高质量的生成模型，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic
capabilities for LLMs. The source code will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了铰接物体的时间动态特性，且缺乏4D全景分割的基准数据集，阻碍了该领域的发展。

Method: 构建Artic4D数据集，提出CanonSeg4D框架，通过估计每帧偏移将物体部分映射到学习的规范空间，实现跨帧一致对齐。

Result: 在Artic4D数据集上的实验表明，CanonSeg4D在复杂场景下的全景分割精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 时间建模和规范对齐在动态物体理解中具有显著效果，为4D铰接物体感知的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances
in 4D articulated object perception.

To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

*Zehui Feng,Tian Qiu,Tong Wu,Junxuan Li,Huayuan Xu,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PreResQ-R1是一个基于偏好-响应解耦强化学习的视觉质量评估框架，统一了绝对分数回归和相对排序一致性，在图像和视频质量评估任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中主要依赖监督微调或仅排序目标，导致推理浅层、分数校准差和跨领域泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出双分支奖励公式，分别建模样本内响应一致性和样本间偏好对齐，通过组相对策略优化进行优化，并设计了全局-时间和局部-空间数据流策略用于视频质量评估。

Result: 在仅使用6K图像和28K视频进行强化学习微调后，在10个IQA和5个VQA基准测试中达到最先进水平，IQA任务中SRCC和PLCC分别提升5.30%和2.15%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了定量性能提升，还产生了与人类对齐的推理轨迹，揭示了质量判断背后的感知线索。

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除装配前手动搜索、分类或标记不同组件的需求，通过将装配指导与组件实时位置连接来提高装配效率。

Method: 使用基于深度学习的物体识别技术识别不同装配组件，在物理空间中显示组件的边界框和放置位置，提供逐步装配指导。

Result: 通过LEGO雕塑装配的案例研究证明了使用物体识别进行AR辅助装配的可行性。

Conclusion: 该系统成功展示了AI和AR技术结合在装配任务中的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: We present an AI-assisted Augmented Reality assembly workflow that uses deep
learning-based object recognition to identify different assembly components and
display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays
a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and
where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with
the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need
for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each
assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for
AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO
sculptures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建高质量个性化手部头像面临复杂几何、外观和关节运动的挑战，且缺乏包含准确3D几何、高分辨率多视角图像和多样化受试者的数据集。

Method: 提出PALM数据集，并开发PALM-Net基线模型，通过基于物理的逆渲染学习手部几何和材料属性的多受试者先验。

Result: PALM数据集捕获了肤色、年龄和几何的丰富变化，PALM-Net能够实现逼真、可重新照光的单图像手部头像个性化。

Conclusion: PALM的规模和多样性使其成为手部建模及相关研究的宝贵现实世界资源。

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

TL;DR: MPRF是一种多模态闭环检测方法，结合视觉和LiDAR基础模型，在非结构化环境中实现稳健的闭环检测和6-DoF位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS拒止环境（如行星探测）中，视觉位置识别因混叠和弱纹理而失效，LiDAR方法则受稀疏性和模糊性影响，需要更鲁棒的闭环检测方案。

Method: 采用两阶段视觉检索策略：使用DINOv2特征和SALAD聚合进行候选筛选，结合SONATA LiDAR描述符进行几何验证，并集成显式6-DoF位姿估计。

Result: 在S3LI数据集上的实验表明，MPRF在精度上优于最先进的检索方法，在低纹理区域增强了位姿估计的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MPRF在准确性、效率和可靠性之间实现了良好平衡，展示了基础模型在统一位置识别和位姿估计方面的潜力。

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的卷积层修改方法，用于持续学习图像修复任务，无需修改主干架构，能够在不显著增加计算开销的情况下适应新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法在图像修复领域存在不足，需要大量工程化的架构修改，计算开销大。正则化方法不适合修复任务，因为不同修复问题需要不同的特征处理方式。

Method: 通过简单修改卷积层来适应先前修复任务的知识，保持主干架构不变，可以无缝应用于任何深度架构。

Result: 实验验证表明，可以在不损害现有任务性能的情况下引入新修复任务，且新任务的性能通过适应先前任务创建的知识库得到提升。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、轻量级的持续学习解决方案，适用于图像修复领域，能够在不增加显著计算开销的情况下扩展模型能力。

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/aupendu/continual-restore.

TL;DR: 提出基于HierSpeech++的文本到说话人脸合成框架，通过文本生成Wav2Vec2嵌入，联合调节语音和面部生成。采用两阶段训练处理特征分布偏移，实现紧密的音视频对齐和自然的表情同步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到说话人脸合成中音频和面部动作的同步问题，避免推理时对真实音频的依赖，同时保持说话人身份和自然表达。

Method: 使用Text-to-Vec模块从文本生成Wav2Vec2嵌入，采用两阶段训练：先在Wav2Vec2嵌入上预训练，再在TTS输出上微调，处理特征分布偏移。

Result: 实验表明，基于TTS预测的潜在特征调节优于级联管道，在唇形同步和视觉真实感方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现紧密的音视频对齐，保持说话人身份，生成自然、富有表现力的语音和同步的面部动作，无需推理时的真实音频。

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D点云变换器依赖密集令牌表示，导致训练和推理时计算和内存成本高昂。研究发现令牌存在显著冗余，现有模型过度令牌化且可扩展性优化不足。

Method: 提出gitmerge3D方法，通过全局感知的图令牌合并技术来减少令牌数量，挑战了更多令牌必然带来更好性能的普遍假设。

Result: 在多个3D视觉任务中验证，令牌数量减少90-95%的同时保持竞争性能，计算效率得到一致提升。

Conclusion: 这是首个评估大规模3D变换器模型冗余性的工作，为开发更高效的3D基础架构提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and
checkpoints are publicly available at https://gitmerge3d.github.io

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用中分辨率Copernicus卫星图像（Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2）进行建筑物损坏评估的可行性，并发布了xBD-S12数据集，证明在10米分辨率下能有效检测灾害损坏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害需要快速损坏评估来指导人道主义响应，但超高分辨率图像可用性有限，因此研究中分辨率地球观测图像作为补充数据源的潜力。

Method: 创建xBD-S12数据集（10,315对灾前灾后图像对），与xBD基准时空对齐，通过一系列实验评估不同模型架构在损坏检测中的表现。

Result: 实验表明在10米分辨率下能较好检测建筑物损坏，但复杂模型架构在泛化到未见灾害时表现不佳，地理空间基础模型带来的实际效益有限。

Conclusion: Copernicus图像是快速大范围损坏评估的可行数据源，可与超高分辨率图像协同使用，研究发布了数据集、代码和训练模型以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统照片年代估计主要依赖场景信息，但人脸包含丰富的时间线索，特别是多人照片中多个面孔的信息聚合可能提供更准确的年代估计。

Method: 构建了CSFD-1.6M数据集，包含160万张带身份和出生年份标注的人脸；提出概率框架，结合人脸识别、年龄估计模型和职业时间先验来推断拍摄年份。

Result: 实验表明，聚合多个面孔的证据能持续提升性能，该方法显著优于基于场景的基线方法，特别是在包含多个可识别个体的图像中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 利用多个人脸信息进行照片年代估计是有效的，特别是在多人照片中，该方法比传统场景分析方法具有明显优势。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

Conclusion: 该异步处理流水线支持连续低延迟预测，通过多数投票提供稳定输出，为实验控制和智能热管理提供可靠实时反馈

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for
tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing
with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the
BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature
Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures
such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic
cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision
for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and
Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.
On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),
outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter
consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of
backbones such ELAN, MSP, and CSP further enable efficient handling of
multi-scale objects, ensuring scalability and robustness in
resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the potential of

TL;DR: GroupKAN是一种轻量级医学图像分割网络，通过分组KAN变换和分组KAN激活模块，在保持高精度的同时显著降低了参数数量和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有医学图像分割模型中卷积架构缺乏自适应非线性、Transformer架构计算复杂度高且可解释性差的问题，以及U-KAN模型通道数增加时O(C^2)复杂度限制可扩展性的问题。

Method: 提出两个结构化功能模块：1）分组KAN变换，将通道划分为G组进行多元样条映射，将复杂度从O(C^2)降至O(C^2/G)；2）分组KAN激活，在每个通道组内应用共享的基于样条的映射，实现高效的token-wise非线性。

Result: 在三个医学基准数据集（BUSI、GlaS和CVC）上，GroupKAN实现了79.80%的平均IoU，比U-KAN提高了1.11%，同时参数数量仅为U-KAN的47.6%（3.02M vs 6.35M），并显示出更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: GroupKAN通过创新的分组架构设计，在医学图像分割任务中实现了更高的精度、更少的参数和更好的可解释性，解决了现有方法的可扩展性限制。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared
spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise
nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),
GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11
percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),
and shows improved interpretability.

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R通过强化学习驱动的交错式文本-视频思维框架，显著提升了时序搜索和长视频理解的性能，建立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.
