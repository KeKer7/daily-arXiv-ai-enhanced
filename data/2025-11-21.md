Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFit是一个基于多模态大语言模型的通用虚拟试穿框架，通过语义对齐模块和两阶段训练策略解决语义差距和数据稀缺问题，支持多种复杂试穿任务并达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务虚拟试穿框架存在两个关键限制：(1) 文本指令与参考图像之间的语义差距；(2) 复杂场景下的数据稀缺问题。

Method: 提出MLLM引导的语义对齐模块(MGSA)，通过多模态输入和可学习查询集整合信息，施加语义对齐损失来捕捉跨模态语义关系。采用两阶段渐进训练策略和自合成管道从有限数据中学习复杂任务。

Result: UniFit不仅支持多服装和模型到模型试穿等多种VTON任务，而且在广泛实验中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UniFit通过MLLM驱动的语义对齐和渐进训练策略，成功解决了虚拟试穿中的语义差距和数据稀缺挑战，构建了一个通用的高性能VTON框架。

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/zwplus/UniFit.

### [2] [EfficientSAM3: Progressive Hierarchical Distillation for Video Concept Segmentation from SAM1, 2, and 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15833)
*Chengxi Zeng,Yuxuan Jiang,Aaron Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EfficientSAM3模型系列，通过渐进式分层蒸馏方法将SAM3的能力转移到轻量级学生模型中，实现设备端概念分割和跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3虽然具有强大的视觉理解能力，但其统一架构过于复杂，不适合在设备端部署。需要开发高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用渐进式分层蒸馏(PHD)方法，分三个阶段：编码器蒸馏、时序记忆蒸馏和端到端微调，使用轻量级骨干网络如RepViT、TinyViT和EfficientViT。

Result: 在流行的VOS数据集上进行了基准测试，与相关工作相比，实现了强大的性能-效率权衡。

Conclusion: EfficientSAM3通过渐进式分层蒸馏成功将SAM3的能力转移到轻量级模型中，为设备端概念分割和跟踪提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

### [3] [WALDO: Where Unseen Model-based 6D Pose Estimation Meets Occlusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15874)
*Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Yintao Ma,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出四种扩展方法改进基于模型的6D物体姿态估计，包括动态非均匀密集采样、多假设推理、迭代优化和遮挡增强训练，在遮挡场景下显著提升精度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在遮挡场景下容易出错，多阶段流水线的早期错误会传播到后续处理，导致性能下降。需要解决遮挡带来的挑战。

Method: 动态非均匀密集采样策略、多假设推理机制、迭代优化和遮挡增强训练，以及新的加权可见性评估指标。

Result: 在ICBIN数据集上精度提升超过5%，在BOP数据集上提升超过2%，推理速度提升约3倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了遮挡场景下的6D姿态估计问题，显著提升了精度和效率。

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.

### [4] [Automatic Uncertainty-Aware Synthetic Data Bootstrapping for Historical Map Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15875)
*Lukas Arzoumanidis,Julius Knechtel,Jan-Henrik Haunert,Youness Dehbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动深度生成方法和手动随机退化技术，通过将历史地图语料库的制图风格转移到矢量数据上，生成无限数量的合成历史地图，用于解决历史地图分析中标注数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图的自动化分析面临标注训练数据稀缺的挑战，特别是对于特定同质制图领域的地图语料库。创建高质量训练数据耗时费力，而合成数据往往缺乏真实性和多样性。

Method: 采用自动深度生成方法和手动随机退化技术，模拟历史地图扫描中常见的视觉不确定性和噪声，将原始历史地图语料库的制图风格转移到矢量数据上。

Result: 生成的训练数据集被用于使用自构建图卷积网络进行领域自适应语义分割，实现了对数据引导方法的全面评估。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效缓解历史地图分析中训练数据不足的问题，为同质历史地图语料库的土地覆盖解释等任务提供无限数量的合成训练样本。

Abstract: The automated analysis of historical documents, particularly maps, has drastically benefited from advances in deep learning and its success across various computer vision applications. However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans. To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach, the generated training datasets were employed for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on a homogeneous map corpus using a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the impact of our data bootstrapping methods.

### [5] [Box6D : Zero-shot Category-level 6D Pose Estimation of Warehouse Boxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15884)
*Yintao Ma,Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box6D是一种针对仓库场景中存储箱的类别级6D姿态估计方法，通过单次RGB-D观测快速推断箱子尺寸并使用类别CAD模板进行姿态估计，在保持精度的同时将推理时间减少约76%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决仓库自动化、拣货等场景中，现有6D姿态估计方法在灵活性、精度和实用性方面的不足：基于模型的方法需要精确CAD模型且泛化性差；无模型方法在复杂条件下容易失败；类别级方法过于通用且忽略环境先验。

Method: 使用单次RGB-D观测，通过快速二分搜索推断箱子尺寸，基于类别CAD模板而非实例特定模型进行姿态估计，采用深度合理性过滤器和早停策略来拒绝不合理假设。

Result: 在真实仓库场景和公共基准测试中，Box6D在保持竞争性或更优的6D姿态精度的同时，将推理时间减少了约76%。

Conclusion: Box6D为仓库环境中的存储箱6D姿态估计提供了一种高效实用的解决方案，在精度和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段自改进范式，通过让VLM生成详细文本推理来弥合理由差距，然后利用这些自生成推理进行微调，显著提升领域特定视频分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在领域特定视频分类任务中表现不佳，特别是在数据有限的情况下，这源于复杂的时空内容与抽象分类标签之间的语义距离难以弥合。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段提示VLM为每个视频生成详细文本推理，然后在这些自生成推理上微调模型；第二阶段在任务标签上进行常规监督微调。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于直接监督微调，验证了自生成推理作为适应领域特定视频分析的有效且注释高效的范式。

Conclusion: 自生成推理是一种有效的、注释高效的范式，能够成功地将视觉语言模型适应到领域特定的视频分析任务中。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly integral to multimedia understanding; however, they often struggle with domain-specific video classification tasks, particularly in cases with limited data. This stems from a critical \textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.

### [7] [Boosting Medical Visual Understanding From Multi-Granular Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15943)
*Zihan Li,Yiqing Wang,Sina Farsiu,Paul Kinahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MGLL框架，通过多粒度语言学习改进多标签和跨粒度对齐，在医学影像等复杂领域超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等现有方法专注于单标签单粒度对齐，但在医学影像等复杂领域，图像通常对应多个高层标签和不同粒度注释，需要更强大的多标签跨粒度对齐能力

Method: MGLL框架利用结构化多标签监督，整合不同粒度的文本描述，引入带点约束的软标签监督，使用平滑KL散度确保跨粒度一致性，可作为即插即用模块

Result: 在构建的大规模多粒度数据集上预训练，并在多个数据集上评估，MGLL在下游任务中优于其他最先进方法

Conclusion: MGLL有效解决了医学影像等多标签跨粒度场景的对齐问题，为复杂领域的视觉语言理解提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种从3D心脏超声体积中自动选择标准2D视图的方法，通过深度学习分类器和解剖标志启发式算法重建标准超声心动图视图，验证准确率达96%，并保持空间校准和诊断特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心脏超声依赖2D视频，3D超声心动图虽能提供更全面的解剖信息，但医生习惯使用标准2D视图进行诊断。需要一种方法既能利用3D扫描的速度优势，又能提供医生熟悉的2D视图格式。

Method: 应用深度学习视图分类器和基于解剖标志的下游启发式算法，结合心脏病专家提供的启发式规则，从3D心脏超声体积中重建标准超声心动图视图。

Result: 在来自2家医院的1,600个视频中，三位心脏病专家的盲法评估显示96%的准确率。提取的2D视频能够通过AI模型检测心脏异常，并生成临床级的心脏解剖测量。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从3D体积中提取保持空间校准和诊断特征的2D视频，使临床医生能够从3D体积中获得准确的真实世界解释，同时发布了代码和包含29个3D超声心动图视频的数据集。

Abstract: Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .

*Raphael Ruschel,Hardikkumar Prajapati,Awsafur Rahman,B. S. Manjunath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Click2Graph是首个交互式全景视频场景图生成框架，通过单一用户提示（如点击或边界框）实现跨时间分割跟踪、自动发现交互对象并预测三元组，形成时间一致的场景图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频场景图生成系统是封闭的前馈管道，无法融入人类指导；而可提示分割模型缺乏语义或关系推理能力。需要统一视觉提示与时空语义理解的交互框架。

Method: 引入动态交互发现模块生成主体条件化对象提示，以及语义分类头进行联合实体和谓词推理，从单一用户提示实现分割跟踪、交互对象发现和三元组预测。

Result: 在OpenPVSG基准测试中，Click2Graph为用户引导的全景视频场景图生成建立了坚实基础，展示了人类提示如何与全景定位和关系推理相结合。

Conclusion: Click2Graph通过结合人类提示、全景定位和关系推理，实现了可控且可解释的视频场景理解，统一了视觉提示与时空语义理解。

Abstract: State-of-the-art Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) systems provide structured visual understanding but operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines with no ability to incorporate human guidance. In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.

*Muyao Yuan,Yuanhong Zhang,Weizhan Zhang,Lan Ma,Yuan Gao,Jiangyong Ying,Yudeng Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoCLIP通过信息论方法改进CLIP在开放词汇语义分割中的微调，避免过拟合并保持预训练的多模态对齐能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在有限类别上微调CLIP进行分割时会导致过拟合，并破坏预训练的视觉-语言对齐能力

Method: 基于互信息提出两个新目标：压缩像素-文本模态对齐以减少噪声，最大化预训练CLIP与微调模型之间的对齐知识互信息

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了InfoCLIP在开放词汇语义分割中的有效性，展示了其适应性和非对称迁移的优越性

Conclusion: InfoCLIP通过信息论指导的迁移学习，成功提升了CLIP在语义分割任务中的微调效果

Abstract: Recently, the strong generalization ability of CLIP has facilitated open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which labels pixels using arbitrary text. However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于一致性正则化的多任务学习方法，通过可微分的BI-RADS形态特征来减轻乳腺超声肿瘤分割和分类任务之间的破坏性干扰，显著提高了分割任务在外部数据集上的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 所提出的一致性正则化方法有效缓解了多任务学习中的破坏性干扰，显著提高了乳腺超声肿瘤分割任务在外部验证中的泛化性能，为医学图像分析提供了有效的多任务学习解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

Conclusion: 该框架能有效解决细粒度语义理解问题，在统一视觉语义理解任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Achieving visual semantic understanding requires a unified framework that simultaneously handles object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition. However, current advanced approaches rely on global similarity and struggle to capture fine-grained category distinctions and category-specific attribute diversity, especially in large-scale e-commerce scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a detection-guided generative framework that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens. For each detected object, we extract refined ROI-level features and employ a BART-based generator to produce semantic tokens in a coarse-to-fine sequence covering category hierarchies and property-value pairs, with support for property-conditioned attribute recognition. Experiments on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.

Result: 在多个医学影像基准测试中，FADS持续减少性别、种族和民族相关的差异，同时保持强准确性。

Conclusion: 公平感知上下文学习为公平医学图像推理提供了可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

Result: 在CIFAR10-LT、CIFAR100-LT和ImageNet-LT三个基准测试中，该方法在误报率和尾部类别分类准确率方面大幅优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 图表示方法能有效利用样本间关系，显著提升长尾分布数据集中的OOD检测性能，特别是在改善尾部类别识别方面效果显著。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods. Experiments over three benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.

Motivation: 现有基于LoRA微调扩散模型的真实世界图像超分辨率方法无法自适应捕捉复杂退化样本的异质特征，且在相同计算预算下难以实现输入间的知识共享。

Method: 将LoRA中的每个秩视为独立专家，采用固定位置秩作为共享专家；利用CLIP嵌入和预定义正负文本对计算相对退化分数，动态指导专家激活；引入零专家槽和退化感知负载均衡损失，根据退化严重程度动态调整活跃专家数量。

Result: 综合实验验证了该框架的有效性和最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MoR架构成功将稀疏MoE集成到真实世界图像超分辨率中，实现了自适应特征提取和高效计算资源分配。

Abstract: The demonstrated success of sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, exemplified by models such as DeepSeek and Grok, has motivated researchers to investigate their adaptation to diverse domains. In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in plant phenotyping have driven widespread adoption of multi sensor platforms for collecting crop canopy reflectance data. This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的简单框架能够有效解决食品识别中的多个挑战，通过文本-图像对齐实现了优越的性能表现。

Abstract: Training a model for food recognition is challenging because the training samples, which are typically crawled from the Internet, are visually different from the pictures captured by users in the free-living environment. In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.

Motivation: next-scale预测在视觉自回归模型中面临KV内存随尺度数量增长而过度膨胀的问题，限制了模型的可扩展性。

Method: 基于对KV缓存特性的系统分析，提出AMS-KV策略：优先存储关键尺度和局部尺度的KV，并通过跨尺度相似性分析识别缓存需求层。

Result: 相比原始VAR模型，AMS-KV将KV缓存使用减少84.83%，自注意力延迟降低60.48%，并支持更大批次的稳定扩展。

Conclusion: AMS-KV通过智能的KV缓存管理策略，有效解决了next-scale预测中的内存瓶颈问题，显著提升了视觉自回归模型的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) via next-scale prediction has emerged as a scalable image generation paradigm. While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations. Project link: https://ocean-luna.github.io/LiSTAR.gitub.io.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Abstract: We present Rad-GS, a 4D radar-camera SLAM system designed for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, utilizing 3D Gaussian as a differentiable spatial representation. Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar. Real-world reconstruction at kilometer scale validates the potential of Rad-GS for large-scale scene reconstruction.

Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.

Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) methods struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic scenes, often failing to resolve ambiguous pixel correspondences and inadequate densification in dynamic regions. We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects. Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency. Evaluations on Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, improving 0.39dB of PSNR on the Technicolor Light Field dataset. Our visualization shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects, and the error correction method's capability to identify errors and properly initialize new splats.

Abstract: Existing latent diffusion models typically couple scale with content complexity, using more latent tokens to represent higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.

*Chenyang Wu,Jiayi Fu,Chun-Le Guo,Shuhao Han,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTinker提出了一种新的视频帧插值方法，通过引导流上采样和纹理映射来解决高分辨率帧插值中的运动估计问题，避免了传统方法中的模糊、马赛克和重影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频帧插值方法在低分辨率下预测双向流，然后通过上采样获得高分辨率流，这会导致流边缘模糊、马赛克，且无法充分捕捉高分辨率下的精细像素运动，导致插值帧出现重影和不连续。

Method: VTinker包含两个核心组件：引导流上采样(GFU)和纹理映射。GFU使用输入帧作为引导来改善双线性上采样流的模糊细节；纹理映射生成中间代理帧，从中选择清晰的纹理块并映射到代理帧上，通过重建模块生成最终插值帧。

Result: 大量实验表明，VTinker在视频帧插值任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VTinker通过创新的引导流上采样和纹理映射方法，有效解决了高分辨率视频帧插值中的运动估计挑战，显著提升了插值质量。

Abstract: Due to large pixel movement and high computational cost, estimating the motion of high-resolution frames is challenging. Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Wucy0519/VTinker.

Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展使真实图像和合成图像难以区分，现有AI生成图像检测方法在分布外泛化方面存在挑战，主要原因是训练过程中利用了虚假捷径。

Method: 提出PiN-CLIP方法，联合训练噪声生成器和检测网络，通过交叉注意力融合视觉和类别语义特征构建正向激励噪声，在特征空间注入噪声来微调视觉编码器。

Result: 在包含42种不同生成模型的合成图像开放世界数据集上，方法实现了新的最先进性能，平均准确率比现有方法提高了5.4个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过抑制捷径敏感方向并放大稳定取证线索，PiN-CLIP能够提取更鲁棒和泛化的伪影表示，有效解决了AI生成图像检测的泛化挑战。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于压缩视频质量增强的预训练退化表示学习模块和分层终止机制，解决了现有方法在未知QP情况下的局限性以及计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中量化参数(QP)可能部分或完全未知，现有非盲方法依赖已知QP，而当前盲方法只能捕获全局退化信息，缺乏空间细节，且所有QP使用统一架构忽略了不同压缩级别的计算需求差异。

Method: 使用预训练的退化表示学习(DRL)模块解耦和提取高维多尺度退化表示来指导伪影去除，并引入分层终止机制根据压缩级别动态调整伪影减少阶段的数量。

Result: 在QP=22时，相比最先进的盲方法PSNR提升了110%(从0.31dB到0.65dB)，分层终止机制在QP=22时的平均推理时间比QP=42减少了一半。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著提升了盲压缩视频质量增强的性能，并通过自适应计算机制提高了效率，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.

Conclusion: SR3D框架通过解决训练与推理之间的差距，实现了更准确的实时3D目标检测，为动态场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

Conclusion: 提出的SSCP模块能够显著提升水体变化检测的判别能力，可作为即插即用模块集成到现有WBCD模型中。

Abstract: Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.

Conclusion: LEGO-SLAM成功解决了3DGS SLAM中的语义理解挑战，为高级机器人交互提供了实时、开放词汇的语义映射能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to build photorealistic maps. However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.

Conclusion: 显式推理能有效增强嵌入质量，将生成式推理过程融入嵌入提取是提升多模态表示的有效方法

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown exceptional performance in image generation, yet their large parameter counts incur high computational costs, impeding deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

Conclusion: Simba框架通过分布学习方法有效解决了点云补全中的过拟合和噪声敏感问题，实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a fundamental task in 3D vision. A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Motivation: 临床部署需要分割模型在分布偏移和扰动下保持稳定。现有对抗训练方法存在清洁-鲁棒性权衡和高训练成本问题，限制了在医学影像中的可扩展性和可维护性。

Method: 在训练时向多个层注入零均值小噪声，学习频率偏置先验；在推理时应用先验引导的选择性小波重建，抑制噪声敏感频带，增强方向性结构和形状线索，稳定边界响应。

Conclusion: LNG-SWR为医学图像分割提供了一条简单、有效且工程友好的鲁棒性提升路径，适用于对抗训练和标准训练两种模式。

Abstract: Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.

Conclusion: 提出的VTIA方法能够有效诱导视觉语言模型产生冗长输出，为解决模型部署效率问题提供了新的攻击视角。

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models despite recent progress in zero-shot generalization and simulation-to-real-world transfer. Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出RF-CLIP方法，通过模拟人类注意力重聚焦行为来提升CLIP在开放词汇语义分割中的密集预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然利用CLIP的视觉语言对齐取得了不错效果，但很少从可解释性机制角度研究CLIP在密集预测中的性能边界。作者发现CLIP存在类似人类分心的现象，将大量注意力资源从目标区域转移到无关token上。

Method: 提出RF-CLIP方法，这是一种无需训练的方法，通过识别并过滤维度特定的过度激活token，将注意力从干扰token重新聚焦到目标区域，从而提升CLIP的多模态对齐粒度。

Result: 该方法在八个基准测试上达到了最先进的性能，同时保持了较高的推理效率。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类注意力重聚焦行为，RF-CLIP能够有效提升CLIP在开放词汇语义分割中的密集预测能力，证明了注意力机制优化对多模态对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

TL;DR: Mantis是一个新颖的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过解耦视觉预测来提升模型性能，在LIBERO基准测试中达到96.7%的成功率，超越了现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型直接预测高维视觉状态会分散模型容量并带来高昂训练成本，而压缩视觉状态又会造成信息瓶颈，同时忽视语言监督导致理解和推理能力不足。

Method: 提出解耦视觉预测(DVF)，通过元查询和扩散Transformer头的组合将视觉预测从主干网络中分离，利用残差连接提供当前视觉状态，通过简单的下一状态预测目标让元查询自动捕捉潜在动作。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中达到96.7%的成功率，收敛速度快，在真实世界评估中超越了π_{0.5}模型，在指令跟随、泛化到未见指令和推理能力方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Mantis通过解耦视觉预测有效减轻了VLA主干网络的负担，使其能够通过语言监督保持理解和推理能力，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的两阶段模型DSLGA来解决无监督域自适应可见光-红外行人重识别问题，通过域共享学习策略和渐进对齐策略处理跨域和跨模态差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VI-ReID算法在公共数据集上表现良好，但由于公共数据集与真实世界数据存在差异，在实际应用中表现不佳。需要在不降低精度且无需新样本标注的情况下，将知识从公共数据迁移到真实世界数据。

Method: 设计了两阶段模型DSLGA：预训练阶段使用域共享学习策略(DSLS)缓解跨域模态差异，微调阶段使用渐进对齐策略(GAS)通过聚类到整体的方式处理跨模态对齐挑战。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在各种设置下显著优于现有的VI-ReID域自适应方法，甚至优于一些监督方法。

Conclusion: 提出的DSLGA模型有效解决了UDA-VI-ReID中的跨域和跨模态差异问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) has achieved remarkable performance on public datasets. However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.

Motivation: 人类器官由相互连接的子结构组成，其几何形状和空间关系相互约束。现有深度学习方法通常独立处理这些部分，导致解剖学上不合理的重建结果。

Method: 从连接的模板开始，PrIntMesh联合变形所有子结构以匹配患者特定解剖结构，明确保持内部边界并强制生成平滑、无伪影的表面。

Result: 在心脏、海马体和肺部上验证了有效性，实现了高几何精度、正确拓扑结构，即使在有限或噪声训练数据下也能保持鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 与基于体素和表面的方法相比，PrIntMesh能更好地重建共享界面，保持结构一致性，并提供适合临床使用的数据高效解决方案。

Abstract: Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.

Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在具身环境中取得了显著进展，但其对抗鲁棒性在多模态和黑盒条件下的研究仍然不足，现有研究主要关注单模态扰动而忽视了影响具身推理和决策的跨模态错位问题。

Method: VLA-Fool统一了三种多模态对抗攻击：基于梯度和提示的文本扰动、通过补丁和噪声的视觉扰动，以及故意破坏感知与指令间语义对应的跨模态错位攻击，并首次将VLA感知语义空间融入语言提示中。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中使用微调的OpenVLA模型进行实验表明，即使轻微的多模态扰动也会导致显著的行为偏差，揭示了具身多模态对齐的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了VLA模型在多模态对抗攻击下的脆弱性，强调了在具身环境中确保多模态鲁棒性的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

Motivation: 当前无监督图像分类方法主要关注聚类而忽略了表示学习，本文旨在结合聚类集成技术来提升聚类性能

Method: ICCE方法包含三个阶段：1) 在冻结骨干网络上训练多个聚类头生成多样化聚类；2) 使用聚类集成技术整合冲突结果；3) 用共识聚类结果作为伪标签训练图像分类器

Result: 在10个图像分类基准上达到最先进性能：CIFAR10 99.3%、CIFAR100 89%、ImageNet 70.4%，缩小了与有监督方法的性能差距

Conclusion: ICCE是首个在ImageNet上准确率超过70%的完全无监督图像分类方法，证明了聚类集成策略的有效性

Abstract: Unsupervised image classification, or image clustering, aims to group unlabeled images into semantically meaningful categories. Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, "Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型具有先进的推理能力，但它们缺乏人类智能的核心组成部分：在复杂社交互动中'察言观色'和评估欺骗的能力。

Method: 引入多模态交互欺骗评估任务，创建包含同步视频和文本的数据集，评估12个最先进的开源和闭源模型，并提出社交思维链推理流程和动态社交认知记忆模块。

Result: 基准测试显示显著的性能差距，即使是GPT-4o等强大模型也难以可靠地区分真假。提出的框架在该挑战性任务上取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 当前模型无法有效将语言与多模态社交线索相结合，缺乏建模他人知识、信念或意图的能力，需要新方法来构建更具洞察力和可信赖的AI系统。

Abstract: Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将并行RGB和NIR分支连接到共享骨干网络，限制了区分性模态特定特征的全面提取，无法解决目标漂移问题，特别是在存在不可靠输入的情况下。

Method: 部署三个专门化流：RGB帧由视觉编码器处理；NIR帧通过NIR门控适配器与视觉编码器结合进行细化；对于无效模态，一致性轨迹预测模块利用时空线索估计目标运动。还包含动态模板重建和相似性对齐损失。

Conclusion: SwiTrack通过专门化流设计和状态切换机制，有效解决了跨模态目标跟踪中的特征提取和目标漂移问题，显著提升了跟踪性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Abstract: Realistic and smooth full-body tracking is crucial for immersive AR/VR applications. Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.

Conclusion: TetraSDF提供了一个实用的解析网格化解决方案，能够从带有四面体位置编码的神经SDF中精确提取自一致的网格，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Extracting meshes that exactly match the zero-level set of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) remains challenging. Sampling-based methods introduce discretization error, while continuous piecewise affine (CPWA) analytic approaches apply only to plain ReLU MLPs. We present TetraSDF, a precise analytic meshing framework for SDFs represented by a ReLU MLP composed with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder. The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training. Across multiple benchmarks, TetraSDF matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, and its analytic extractor produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to the learned isosurfaces, all with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

Abstract: The task of weed detection is an essential element of precision agriculture since accurate species identification allows a farmer to selectively apply herbicides and fits into sustainable agriculture crop management. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment of edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.

Conclusion: Texture3dgs设计有效实现了移动设备上高效的3D场景重建。

Abstract: Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations.

*Minseok Seo,Mark Hamilton,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Upsample Anything是一个轻量级的测试时优化框架，无需训练即可将低分辨率特征上采样为高分辨率像素级输出，解决了视觉基础模型特征下采样限制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉基础模型（如ViT）的特征通常被下采样14x/16x，限制了它们在像素级应用中的直接使用。现有的特征上采样方法依赖于数据集特定的重新训练或繁重的隐式优化，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。

Result: 在224x224图像上仅需约0.419秒运行时间，在语义分割、深度估计以及深度和概率图上采样任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Upsample Anything提供了一种高效、通用的特征上采样解决方案，无需训练即可实现精确的高分辨率重建，具有良好的跨架构和跨模态迁移能力。

Abstract: We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在嵌入分析中的作用和实用价值存在争议，需要新的理论视角来理解其本质和应用价值。

Method: 将潜在狄利克雷分配扩展到嵌入空间，推导出SAE目标作为最大后验估计器，提出SAE-TM框架：训练SAE学习可重用主题原子，将其解释为下游数据的词分布，无需重新训练即可合并成任意数量主题。

Result: SAE-TM在文本和图像数据集上比强基线产生更连贯的主题，同时保持多样性；成功分析图像数据集的主题结构并追踪日本木版画的主题演变。

Conclusion: SAE可视为大规模跨模态主题分析的有效工具，为嵌入分析提供了新的理论框架和应用方向。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.

Abstract: We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.

Conclusion: WWE-UIE通过集成三个可解释先验，成功实现了高效的水下图像增强，在保持高质量的同时大幅降低计算成本，适用于实时应用场景。

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to restore visibility and correct color distortions caused by wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component. The source code is available at https://github.com/chingheng0808/WWE-UIE.

Conclusion: ChangeDINO通过有效利用语义信息和多尺度特征表示，显著提升了遥感建筑变化检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes from co-registered bi-temporal images. However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) is a critical technique for enhancing low-resolution facial images and has significant implications for face-related tasks. However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

Abstract: The study of terrain and landform classification through UAV remote sensing diverges significantly from ground vehicle patrol tasks. Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.

Result: 在广泛实验中表现出最先进的性能，并具有出色的鲁棒性

Conclusion: MOMNet能够有效处理不对齐的RGB-D数据，为现实场景中的深度超分辨率提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Recent guided depth super-resolution methods are premised on the assumption of strictly spatial alignment between depth and RGB, achieving high-quality depth reconstruction. However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness.

Abstract: Offline signature verification (OSV) is a frequently utilized technology in forensics. This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios. The combination of generalizability and interpretability significantly bolsters the potential of DetailSemNet for real-world applications.

Conclusion: CAMS通过语义特征提取和多维空间解缠，有效提升了组合零样本学习的泛化能力，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to learn the concepts of attributes and objects in seen compositions and to recognize their unseen compositions. Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap), while long regarded as the gold standard for accuracy, faces practical challenges, such as time-consuming preparation and marker identification ambiguity, due to its reliance on dense marker configurations, which fundamentally limit its scalability. To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation. Trained on synthesized data from the AMASS dataset, our end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation. Real-world data captured using a Vicon optical tracking system further demonstrates the practical viability of our approach. Overall, the results show that combining sparse 6-DoF RBM with a manifold-aware geodesic loss yields a practical and high-fidelity solution for real-time MoCap in graphics, virtual reality, and biomechanics.

Abstract: Self-supervised surround-view depth estimation enables dense, low-cost 3D perception with a 360° field of view from multiple minimally overlapping images. Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.

### [70] [Beyond Visual Cues: Leveraging General Semantics as Support for Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16435)
*Jin Wang,Bingfeng Zhang,Jian Pang,Mengyu Liu,Honglong Chen,Weifeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出LDAG架构，通过语言驱动的属性泛化来解决少样本分割中支持图像参考不足的问题，利用大语言模型生成多属性描述来构建鲁棒的支持策略，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉表示的类内差异，从支持图像提取的元信息无法为未训练类提供准确指导。作者认为支持图像参考并非必需，关键是为训练和未训练类提供无偏的元指导。

Method: 提出语言驱动的属性泛化(LDAG)架构：1) 多属性增强(MaE)模块通过大语言模型生成目标类的多个详细属性描述，构建精细的视觉-文本先验指导；2) 多模态属性对齐(MaA)实现属性文本与视觉特征的跨模态交互。

Result: 实验表明该方法明显优于现有方法，达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 利用目标属性语言描述构建鲁棒支持策略比依赖支持图像参考更有效，语言驱动的元指导能更好地处理少样本分割任务。

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了StreetView-Waste数据集，用于城市垃圾管理中的垃圾箱检测、跟踪和溢出分割任务，并提供了基准模型和性能提升策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有垃圾检测数据集缺乏对垃圾箱溢出的监控，特别是在垃圾车拍摄图像中的容器跟踪方面关注不足，限制了实际物流应用。

Method: 创建包含垃圾和垃圾箱的城市场景数据集，提供三个任务的基准模型，并提出启发式跟踪方法和利用几何先验的模型无关分割框架。

Result: 微调的目标检测器在垃圾箱检测上表现良好，但跟踪方法在数量估计上困难；提出的启发式方法将平均绝对计数误差降低79.6%，几何感知策略将轻量模型的分割mAP@0.5提高27%。

Conclusion: StreetView-Waste为城市垃圾管理的真实感知系统研究提供了具有挑战性的基准，展示了多模态输入在此任务中的价值。

Abstract: Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.

*Ziyan Liu,Yeqiu Chen,Hongyi Cai,Tao Lin,Shuo Yang,Zheng Liu,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLA-Pruner是一个专门为视觉-语言-动作模型设计的token剪枝方法，通过双层级重要性标准（语义级和动作级）来保留关键视觉token，解决了现有方法只关注语义而忽略动作执行需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLM token剪枝方法仅基于语义显著性选择token，忽视了VLA模型的双系统特性（高层语义理解和低层动作执行），导致丢弃对动作生成至关重要的信息，严重降低VLA性能。

Method: 提出双层级重要性标准：视觉-语言预填充注意力用于语义相关性，通过时间平滑估计的动作解码注意力用于动作重要性。基于此标准设计自适应双层级token选择策略，在给定计算预算下保留紧凑且信息丰富的视觉token。

Result: 实验表明VLA-Pruner在多种VLA架构和多样化机器人任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VLA-Pruner是一个通用即插即用的VLA专用token剪枝方法，有效利用了VLA的双系统特性和机器人操作中的时间连续性，显著提升了模型效率而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

Motivation: 由于3D训练数据有限，而2D数据集丰富，需要开发能够理解3D场景的多模态语言模型。

Method: 受立体主义画家启发，通过多视角3D重建生成物体的全方位视觉表示，使用多视角2D图像描述3D场景。

Result: 在3D视觉问答和3D语言定位任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于之前的2D基础VLM解决方案。

Conclusion: LLaVA³证明了仅使用多视角2D图像就能有效提升VLM的3D场景理解能力，无需额外3D数据或模型微调。

Abstract: Developing a multi-modal language model capable of understanding 3D scenes remains challenging due to the limited availability of 3D training data, in contrast to the abundance of 2D datasets used for vision-language models (VLM). As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA$^3$ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.

Conclusion: FastSurfer-CC提供了一个高效、全自动的胼胝体形态测量解决方案，在神经科学研究中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The corpus callosum, the largest commissural structure in the human brain, is a central focus in research on aging and neurological diseases. It is also a critical target for interventions such as deep brain stimulation and serves as an important biomarker in clinical trials, including those investigating remyelination therapies. Despite extensive research on corpus callosum segmentation, few publicly available tools provide a comprehensive and automated analysis pipeline. To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis. We demonstrate that FastSurfer-CC outperforms existing specialized tools across the individual tasks. Moreover, our method reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls that are not detected by the current state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在视频预测中处理遮挡问题的方法，通过引入点流和深度图信息来改进遮挡场景下的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频预测是机器人和世界建模等下游应用的基础任务，但遮挡问题一直是视频预测的固有挑战。作者假设提供明确的运动信息（通过点流）和几何结构信息（通过深度图）能够改善遮挡和背景运动情况下的预测效果。

Method: 使用标准的多对象潜在变换器架构进行未来帧预测，但修改该架构以融入深度和点流信息。在合成和真实世界数据集上进行受控评估，不仅使用基于外观的指标，还使用对象掩码的Wasserstein距离来有效测量预测的运动分布。

Result: 研究发现，当预测模型借助点流和深度信息时，在遮挡场景下表现更好，并且相比不使用这些模态的模型，能够预测更准确的背景运动。

Conclusion: 通过整合点流和深度信息，视频预测模型在遮挡场景中的性能得到显著提升，特别是在处理背景运动方面表现更优。

Abstract: Video prediction is a fundamental task for various downstream applications, including robotics and world modeling. Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.

Abstract: Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DCE-MRI在乳腺癌筛查和治疗中很重要，但不同采集协议和个体因素导致组织外观差异大，使得自动肿瘤分割具有挑战性。

Method: 使用特征线性调制(FiLM)层将采集时间信息融入模型，根据特定采集序列调制模型特征，充分利用每个成像研究中可变数量的图像。

Result: 在域内和域外数据集上的评估显示，融入相位采集时间知识提高了肿瘤分割性能和模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 利用图像采集时间信息可以有效改善乳腺DCE-MRI中的肿瘤分割，提高模型在不同数据集上的泛化性能。

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.

Abstract: Using ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) for indoor visual capturing opens up a wide range of applications. However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance. We thus provide a reliable tool to facilitate downstream position-aware applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在否定和释义文本上表现不稳定，因为否定会以最小词汇变化彻底改变含义，而释义会产生不同表达但相同含义的文本，这对改进视觉-语言模型的对齐提出了挑战。

Method: 提出SemCLIP方法，结合释义和否定，设计新的对比损失函数，并使用LLM生成的包含原始、释义和否定文本描述的三元组来训练CLIP类模型。

Conclusion: SemCLIP能够显著提高对语义变换的鲁棒性，在保持原有性能的同时更好地处理否定和释义文本。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体操运动员跟踪面临独特挑战：摄像机数量有限，且由于光照变化、背景、服装和遮挡等因素，多摄像机检测可能在某些视角失败，导致传统三角测量方法难以准确确定3D轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过结合领域知识，该方法能够有效补偿不确定轨迹，最小化跟踪失败，为体操裁判系统提供了鲁棒的跟踪解决方案。

Abstract: We present a robust multi-camera gymnast tracking, which has been applied at international gymnastics championships for gymnastics judging. Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

Abstract: This paper presents an applied analysis of local and global methods, with a focus on the Horn-Schunck algorithm for optical flow computation. We explore the theoretical and practical aspects of local approaches, such as the Lucas-Kanade method, and global techniques such as Horn-Schunck. Additionally, we implement a multiresolution version of the Horn-Schunck algorithm, using bilinear interpolation and prolongation to improve accuracy and convergence. The study investigates the effectiveness of these combined strategies in estimating motion between frames, particularly under varying image conditions.

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段检测框架，通过对比学习提取特征嵌入，结合k-NN分类器进行少样本学习，有效检测合成图像并识别生成源，无需频繁重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI快速发展导致合成图像难以与真实内容区分，传统检测方法依赖定期重新训练，计算成本高且不实用。

Method: 第一阶段使用监督对比学习训练视觉深度学习模型提取特征嵌入，第二阶段使用k-NN分类器在少样本学习范式中进行分类。

Result: 仅需每类150张图像，检测准确率达到91.3%，比现有方法提升5.2个百分点；在源归属任务中，AUC和OSCR分别提升14.70%和4.27%。

Conclusion: 该框架为适应快速演进的生成AI环境提供了稳健、可扩展的取证归属系统，无需繁琐的重新训练流程。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅作为NeRF的替代方案在地球观测中表现出色，但原始EOGS框架需要外部预处理和优化工具。本研究旨在开发一个端到端的解决方案，直接在原始卫星数据上操作，并改进相机姿态估计。

Method: 扩展EOGS框架，直接处理原始高分辨率全色数据；集成光流技术进行束调整；引入早期停止和TSDF后处理等改进措施。

Result: 在IARPA 2016和DFC2019数据集上，EOGS++在重建质量和效率方面达到最先进水平，建筑重建的MAE误差从1.33改善到1.19，优于原始EOGS和其他基于NeRF的方法。

Conclusion: EOGS++成功实现了端到端的卫星图像3D重建，无需外部预处理和优化工具，在保持高斯泼溅计算优势的同时，显著提升了重建质量和几何精度。

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been introduced as a compelling alternative to NeRF for Earth observation, offering com- petitive reconstruction quality with significantly reduced training times. In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting. Our model demonstrates an improvement from 1.33 to 1.19 mean MAE errors on buildings compared to the original EOGS models

TL;DR: VARiant通过深度自适应采样和渐进训练策略，在保持VAR模型质量的同时显著降低内存消耗和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型的多尺度生成导致累积KV缓存带来巨大内存开销，限制了实际部署。研究发现VAR模型存在尺度-深度不对称依赖：早期尺度对网络深度极其敏感，而后期尺度对深度减少具有鲁棒性。

Method: 从30层VAR网络中通过等距采样选择多个子网络（16层到2层），早期尺度使用完整网络处理，后期尺度使用子网络。子网络与完整网络共享权重，实现单一模型内的灵活深度调整。采用渐进训练策略解决权重共享带来的优化冲突。

Result: 在ImageNet上，VARiant-d16和VARiant-d8达到接近原始VAR-d30的质量（FID 2.05/2.12 vs 1.95），同时减少40-65%内存消耗。VARiant-d2实现3.5倍加速和80%内存减少，质量适度下降（FID 2.97）。

Conclusion: VARiant的单模型架构支持零成本运行时深度切换，提供从高质量到极致效率的灵活部署选项，满足多样化应用场景需求。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.
  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.
  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.
  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in stereo matching have focused on accuracy, often at the cost of significantly increased model size. Traditionally, the community has regarded efficient models as incapable of zero-shot ability due to their limited capacity. In this paper, we introduce Lite Any Stereo, a stereo depth estimation framework that achieves strong zero-shot generalization while remaining highly efficient. To this end, we design a compact yet expressive backbone to ensure scalability, along with a carefully crafted hybrid cost aggregation module. We further propose a three-stage training strategy on million-scale data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components demonstrate that an ultra-light model can deliver strong generalization, ranking 1st across four widely used real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, our model attains accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art non-prior-based accurate methods while requiring less than 1% computational cost, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

Conclusion: POMA-3D通过点图方式成功解决了3D表示学习的预训练先验和数据稀缺问题，为3D场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce POMA-3D, the first self-supervised 3D representation model learned from point maps. Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

Motivation: 医学分割网络需要选择性遗忘知识以满足隐私合规、伦理部署和数据集持续修订的需求。

Method: 采用教师-学生蒸馏范式，通过LoRA约束子空间更新，在低秩解码器空间中擦除特定病变或类别的表示，同时保留全局解剖理解。包含强遗忘阶段和温和恢复阶段。

Result: 在ISIC分割中，遗忘集IoU从0.875降至0.509，同时保留集和验证集性能保持竞争力。在CHASE数据集上表现一致。ISIC分类中遗忘集准确率从87.0%降至64.1%，保留集准确率从83.9%提升至90.6%。

Conclusion: 基于LoRA的子空间遗忘为医学图像分析提供了负责任、可控和可逆的遗忘路径，使模型能够遗忘敏感样本或结构，同时保留重要性能。

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发、解释和压缩混合Mamba-Transformer架构的初步步骤，为混合模型可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.

Abstract: The early detection of wildfires is a critical environmental challenge, with timely identification of smoke plumes being key to mitigating large-scale damage. While deep neural networks have proven highly effective for localization tasks, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection limits their potential. In response, we leverage generative AI techniques to address this data limitation by synthesizing a comprehensive, annotated smoke dataset. We then explore unsupervised domain adaptation methods for smoke plume segmentation, analyzing their effectiveness in closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To further refine performance, we integrate advanced generative approaches such as style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and image matting. These methods aim to enhance the realism of synthetic data and bridge the domain disparity, paving the way for more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

Result: AGU能够使用低质量、低分辨率输入实时渲染高质量图像，在低光照场景下优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: AGU方法有效解决了低光照图像引导上采样的挑战，实现了实时高质量图像渲染。

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

SAM 3D excels in natural images, where occlusion and scene clutter are common and visual recognition cues from context play a larger role. We achieve this with a human- and model-in-the-loop pipeline for annotating object shape, texture, and pose, providing visually grounded 3D reconstruction data at unprecedented scale. We learn from this data in a modern, multi-stage training framework that combines synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment, breaking the 3D "data barrier". We obtain significant gains over recent work, with at least a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes.

Abstract: Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

TL;DR: TRIM是一种后训练方法，通过时间轨迹减少和空间实例掩码去噪，加速3D高斯扩散模型推理，同时保持输出质量并支持推理时缩放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯扩散模型由于大量高斯基元导致去噪和后处理耗时，生成速度慢且沿采样轨迹的可扩展性有限。

Method: 提出轻量级选择器模型评估潜在高斯基元质量，实现早期轨迹减少；引入实例掩码去噪过滤冗余背景区域，减少每步去噪计算。

Result: 实验表明TRIM显著提高了3D生成的效率和质量。

Conclusion: TRIM在不影响输出质量的前提下，有效加速了3D高斯扩散模型的推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from time-intensive denoising and post-denoising processing due to the massive number of Gaussian primitives, resulting in slow generation and limited scalability along sampling trajectories. To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了3D层次语义分割中的多层级冲突和类别不平衡问题，具有优异的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) is crucial for embodied intelligence applications that demand a multi-grained and multi-hierarchy understanding of 3D scenes. Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance, and its core components can also be used as a plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限环境提供了计算高效、性能保持的解决方案，是迭代剪枝方案如COLT的更高效替代方案。

Abstract: Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: Cambrian-S提出的空间超感知视频世界模型基准测试存在缺陷，简单的无时序基线模型NoSense就能在VSR基准上达到95%准确率，而VSC基准中的定制推理方法利用了捷径启发式而非真正的空间认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对Cambrian-S提出的视频空间超感知基准进行批判性分析，验证这些基准是否真正衡量了空间认知能力，以及其推理方法是否利用了基准中的捷径。

Method: 引入简单的基线模型NoSense（仅使用词袋SigLIP模型，几乎忽略时序结构）测试VSR基准；在VSC基准上设计VSC-Repeat测试，通过重复视频内容来检验推理方法的鲁棒性。

Result: NoSense在4小时视频的VSR基准上达到95%准确率，表明该基准无需空间认知即可解决；VSC-Repeat测试使Cambrian-S的准确率从42%降至0%，证明其推理方法依赖房间不重复访问的捷径。

Conclusion: 当前VSI-Super基准无法可靠衡量空间超感知能力，Cambrian-S的推理方法通过利用基准中的捷径而非真正的空间认知来提升性能。

Abstract: Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UV展开方法在处理AI生成的噪声、凹凸不平、条件差的网格时表现不佳，会产生高度碎片化的图表和次优边界，导致伪影并阻碍下游任务。

Method: 基于PartField学习部件分解，结合高层语义部件分解和新的几何启发式算法，采用自上而下的递归框架，确保每个图表的扭曲低于用户指定阈值，同时最小化图表总数。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上的评估显示，PartUV在图表数量和接缝长度方面优于现有工具和最近的神经方法，达到可比较的扭曲度，在挑战性网格上具有高成功率。

Conclusion: PartUV提供了一种有效的部件对齐UV展开解决方案，能够处理困难网格并支持新的应用，如部件特定的多瓦片打包。

Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

Conclusion: TriDiff-4D通过扩散基三平面重定位实现了高质量、时序一致的4D虚拟形象生成，在时序一致性、运动准确性、计算效率和视觉保真度方面表现出色，为4D生成领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

Motivation: 现有方法在多对象9D姿态（位置、大小、方向）同时控制方面存在局限性，可控性和质量不足，需要更全面的多对象姿态控制解决方案。

Method: 提出SceneDesigner方法，在预训练基础模型中加入分支网络，使用CNOCS映射编码相机视角的9D姿态信息，采用两阶段训练策略（包括强化学习微调）解决数据不平衡问题，并在推理时使用解耦对象采样技术。

Result: 广泛的定性和定量实验表明，SceneDesigner在可控性和质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SceneDesigner通过创新的表示方法和训练策略，成功实现了准确灵活的多对象9自由度姿态控制，为可控图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

Abstract: Recent progress in generative video models, such as Veo-3, has shown surprising zero-shot reasoning abilities, creating a growing need for systematic and reliable evaluation. We introduce V-ReasonBench, a benchmark designed to assess video reasoning across four key dimensions: structured problem-solving, spatial cognition, pattern-based inference, and physical dynamics. The benchmark is built from both synthetic and real-world image sequences and provides a diverse set of answer-verifiable tasks that are reproducible, scalable, and unambiguous. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art video models reveal clear dimension-wise differences, with strong variation in structured, spatial, pattern-based, and physical reasoning. We further compare video models with strong image models, analyze common hallucination behaviors, and study how video duration affects Chain-of-Frames reasoning. Overall, V-ReasonBench offers a unified and reproducible framework for measuring video reasoning and aims to support the development of models with more reliable, human-aligned reasoning skills.

Conclusion: VNEP任务将下一事件预测从"讲述"转变为"展示"，VANS模型通过强化学习成功解决了这一挑战性任务，为程序性学习和创造性探索提供了更直观的视频回答方式。

Abstract: While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型无论问题难易都倾向于生成冗长的推理链，导致计算资源浪费。受人类快慢思考机制启发，希望让模型能根据任务复杂度自动调整思考模式。

Result: DualMindVLM模型显著超越基础模型，性能与最先进视觉推理模型相当，同时保持了极高的token效率。

Conclusion: 提出的简单RL方法成功实现了视觉语言模型的快慢思考模式切换，在保证性能的同时大幅提升了计算效率。

Abstract: When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.

Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型的训练仍依赖人工标注数据或外部验证的奖励模型，限制了自主性和可扩展性。本文旨在以完全无监督的方式提升LMM的推理能力。

Method: 提出EvoLMM自进化框架，从单一骨干模型实例化两个协作代理：Proposer生成多样化的图像基础问题，Solver通过内部一致性解决问题，通过持续的自我奖励过程进行学习。

Conclusion: 这种简单而有效的方法为未来在完全无监督方式下自改进LMM的研究提供了坚实的基线。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖准确的地面真实相机姿态和人体姿态作为输入，但在实际应用中姿态估计往往存在噪声，导致重建质量显著下降。

Method: 提出NoPo-Avatar方法，仅从图像重建化身，完全去除对测试时人体姿态输入的依赖。

Result: 在THuman2.0、XHuman和HuGe100K数据集上的实验表明，NoPo-Avatar在实际设置（无地面真实姿态）中优于现有基线，在实验室设置（有地面真实姿态）中也能达到可比结果。

Conclusion: 通过消除对测试时人体姿态的依赖，NoPo-Avatar能够更好地处理噪声姿态估计，具有更广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

Abstract: The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.
