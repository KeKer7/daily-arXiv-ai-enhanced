*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA是一个基于扩散模型的文本到动作生成方法，通过双路径锚定机制解决语义对齐和运动伪影问题，在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于U-Net的扩散模型在文本到动作生成中存在语义错位和运动伪影问题，深层网络梯度衰减导致高级特征学习不足。

Method: 提出LUMA模型，包含双路径锚定：时间域的轻量级MoCLIP模型提供语义监督，频率域的低频DCT分量提供补充对齐信号，通过时间调制机制自适应融合。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别达到FID 0.035和0.123的SOTA性能，收敛速度比基线快1.4倍。

Conclusion: LUMA通过双路径锚定机制有效解决了文本到动作生成中的语义对齐问题，是一个高效可扩展的高保真解决方案。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [2] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个包含2,720个问答对的视觉问答基准测试，专注于在密集场景中测试VLMs的简单视觉理解能力，发现当前最佳模型在最具挑战性的测试集上仅达到19.6%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VQA数据集主要关注全局图像理解，但作者认为现有基准高估了VLMs的性能，特别是在处理密集场景细节时仍存在挑战。

Method: 使用高分辨率公共领域绘画扫描图像，这些图像包含多个人物、动作和详细背景，手动标注了六类任务的问题来全面测试场景理解。

Result: 测试了37个模型，最佳模型(o3)在最难测试集上仅达到19.6%准确率，所有问题上的总体准确率为69.5%。错误分析揭示了计数能力不足、OCR失败和逻辑不一致等问题。

Conclusion: VisualOverload揭示了当前视觉模型在密集场景理解方面的关键差距，为开发更好的模型提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [3] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种学习框架来编辑视频中的生理信号（心率），在保持视觉质量的同时保护隐私，通过3D VAE和文本提示融合实现可控的心率调制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于摄像头的心率估计存在隐私泄露风险，因为生理信号可能揭示个人健康和情绪状态等敏感信息，需要一种方法来编辑这些信号。

Method: 使用预训练的3D VAE编码输入视频，通过冻结文本编码器嵌入目标心率提示，使用可训练的时空层和AdaLN融合特征，在解码器中应用FiLM和微调输出层来避免生理信号退化。

Result: 方法在选定数据集上保持视觉质量（PSNR 38.96 dB，SSIM 0.98），同时实现平均心率调制误差为10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE。

Conclusion: 该设计的可控心率编辑可用于匿名化真实视频中的生物特征信号或合成具有所需生命体征的逼真视频。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [4] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的诊断基准，专注于视角转换这一核心挑战，包含平移、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化等细粒度诊断类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视角转换需要多种认知能力，如跨视图识别物体、相对位置定位和心理模拟变换，因此需要创建一个能够系统评估VLMs空间推理能力的基准。

Method: 设计了围绕视角转换核心挑战的细粒度诊断类别，从简单的单物体任务逐步过渡到要求更高的多物体视角转换设置，评估了37个最先进的VLMs。

Result: 结果揭示了VLMs的系统性弱点：强烈的自我中心偏见、旋转理解能力差、在对称和句法重构下表现不一致。人类准确率高达91.2%，人类反应时间与VLM准确率强相关。

Conclusion: SpinBench为理解VLMs的空间推理能力提供了关键见解，突显了它们在物理空间推理方面的关键差距，能够捕捉人类和VLMs共享的空间推理挑战。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [5] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了多模态时空变换器(MM-STT)，通过融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验来预测高分辨率地面沉降，在EGMS数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如ConvLSTM难以建模长程依赖关系，且先前工作局限于单模态数据范式，无法有效处理地面沉降的复杂非线性动态。

Method: 开发了多模态时空变换器框架，采用联合时空注意力机制统一处理所有多模态特征，融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验。

Result: 在EGMS数据集上建立了新的最先进水平，相比所有基线方法（包括STGCN和STAEformer等SOTA方法），将长程预测的RMSE降低了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 对于此类问题，架构固有的深度多模态融合能力对于实现变革性性能至关重要。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [6] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs通过文本监督微调和稀疏标签即可实现专家级的3D深度估计，无需复杂架构或损失函数，首次使VLMs在3D理解任务上媲美纯视觉模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs在3D理解方面表现不佳，而专业视觉模型在度量深度估计等任务上能达到超人类精度，但需要特定架构和损失函数。研究目标是探索VLMs能否在不改变架构或损失的情况下达到专家级精度。

Method: 采用基于文本的监督微调与稀疏标签，通过视觉提示和内在条件增强解决像素参考和跨数据集相机模糊问题，无需密集预测头或复杂回归/正则化损失。

Result: DepthLM方法使用更小的模型，在精度上超越最先进VLMs 2倍以上，首次使VLMs与纯视觉模型相媲美，且自然避免了过度平滑问题。

Conclusion: VLMs通过简单方法即可解锁强大的3D理解能力，单个VLM能够覆盖度量深度之外的多种3D任务，展示了VLMs在3D视觉任务中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [7] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于泛北极海冰浓度制图和不确定性量化的贝叶斯Transformer方法，结合Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2数据，通过全局和局部模块提取特征，并采用决策级融合处理数据异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率泛北极海冰制图及其可靠的不确定性量化对于海冰浓度制图至关重要，但由于海冰特征细微、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战而难以实现。

Method: 设计了具有全局和局部模块的高分辨率Transformer模型以改进特征提取；提出贝叶斯扩展将参数视为随机变量以改进不确定性量化；在决策级融合三种不同类型数据（Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2）以处理数据异质性。

Result: 在2021年9月的泛北极数据集上测试，结果表明该方法相比其他不确定性量化方法，能够获得高分辨率海冰浓度图和稳健的不确定性图。

Conclusion: 提出的贝叶斯Transformer方法在泛北极海冰浓度制图和不确定性量化方面表现出色，能够有效应对海冰特征细微、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

### [8] [Infrastructure Sensor-enabled Vehicle Data Generation using Multi-Sensor Fusion for Proactive Safety Applications at Work Zone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25452)
*Suhala Rabab Saba,Sakib Khan,Minhaj Uddin Ahmad,Jiahe Cao,Mizanur Rahman,Li Zhao,Nathan Huynh,Eren Erman Ozguven*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器的多传感器融合框架，使用卡尔曼滤波进行后期融合，显著提高了车辆检测和定位精度，在复杂交通环境中实现可靠的车辙跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施感知在复杂道路环境（如施工区）中面临的视角失真、几何复杂、遮挡和成本等实际部署障碍。

Method: 集成路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器到协同仿真环境，开发可扩展的车辆检测和定位框架，采用基于卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略。

Result: 仿真中融合算法将纵向误差降低达70%，横向精度保持在1-3米内；现场验证显示融合轨迹与真实车辆路径高度匹配，即使单传感器数据间歇或降级。

Conclusion: 卡尔曼滤波传感器融合能可靠补偿单个传感器限制，提供精确鲁棒的车辙跟踪能力，为复杂交通环境中部署基础设施支持的多传感器系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

### [9] [Seeing Before Reasoning: A Unified Framework for Generalizable and Explainable Fake Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25502)
*Kaiqing Lin,Zhiyuan Yan,Ruoxin Chen,Junyan Ye,Ke-Yue Zhang,Yue Zhou,Peng Jin,Bin Li,Taiping Yao,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Forensic-Chat方法，通过"先观察后推理"的新范式，增强多模态大语言模型对伪造痕迹的感知能力，实现更好的AI生成图像检测和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在AI生成图像检测中表现不佳，主要原因是视觉编码器针对语义识别优化，对低级伪造痕迹不敏感，且微调数据与预训练分布差异大导致知识遗忘。

Method: 提出"先观察后推理"范式，首先训练MLLMs感知伪造痕迹，增强其伪造感知视觉能力；开发Forensic-Chat助手和ExplainFake-Bench评估基准。

Result: 实验表明该方法在泛化性和可解释性方面表现优越，能够提供真正可靠的可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过增强伪造感知视觉能力，使MLLMs能够基于实际观察进行推理，显著提升了AI生成图像检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

### [10] [DeepFake Detection in Dyadic Video Calls using Point of Gaze Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25503)
*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用视线追踪技术检测实时视频会议中深度伪造攻击的方法，通过分析视线模式来识别无法模仿人类微妙非语言交流的深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的发展，恶意行为者开始在视频会议中进行实时钓鱼攻击。由于深度伪造无法模仿人类在对话中的微妙视线交流模式，这为检测提供了机会。

Method: 基于对二元对话中视线模式研究的仔细分析，选择可解释的特征构建模型，利用恶意行为者视频流中估计的视线来检测深度伪造。

Result: 在自建的新数据集上测试，模型达到了82%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个利用视线点追踪进行深度伪造检测的方法，为实时视频会议安全提供了新的检测手段。

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于视觉的6自由度物体姿态估计算法，专门用于火星样本返回任务中的机器人手臂定位，在硬件受限条件下实现鲁棒的姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星样本返回任务中机器人手臂在严重硬件约束下对多个目标物体进行低间隙拾取和插入时的定位问题。

Method: 利用自定义渲染器和针对边缘域设计的新模板匹配度量，仅使用低保真、无纹理的3D模型作为输入实现鲁棒姿态估计。

Result: 在合成数据集、地球物理测试台和火星实地图像上的广泛评估表明，该方法在计算和内存受限的定位任务中，在鲁棒性和准确性方面均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用硬件上的廉价可靠定位开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

### [12] [LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25528)
*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG是一种结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型的混合方法，用于解决户外驾驶场景中的指称接地问题，通过提取属性、检测候选区域和符号推理来精确定位目标对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景中的指称接地具有挑战性，因为场景变化大、视觉相似对象多、动态元素复杂，使得解析自然语言指称（如"右边的黑色汽车"）变得困难。

Method: 提出LLM-RG混合管道，结合现成的视觉语言模型进行细粒度属性提取和大型语言模型进行符号推理。处理图像和自由形式指称表达式，使用LLM提取相关对象类型和属性，检测候选区域，用VLM生成丰富视觉描述符，然后将这些描述符与空间元数据结合到自然语言提示中，输入LLM进行链式推理以识别指称边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG相比基于LLM和VLM的基线方法取得了显著提升。消融实验显示添加3D空间线索能进一步改进接地性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明，以零样本方式应用的VLM和LLM具有互补优势，能够实现鲁棒的户外指称接地。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [13] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VISOR++方法，通过优化的视觉输入实现多模态视觉语言模型的行为控制，无需运行时访问模型内部，可跨模型部署使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法存在局限性：系统提示容易被用户指令覆盖，基于激活的转向向量需要侵入式运行时模型访问，无法在API服务和闭源模型上使用。需要开发跨模型通用的转向方法。

Method: VISOR++通过生成优化的视觉输入来诱导目标激活模式，实现行为控制。可以为多个VLM生成单一通用图像来模拟各自的转向向量，无需运行时模型访问。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和IDEFICS2-8B等开放模型上，VISOR++图像在拒绝、奉承和生存本能三个对齐方向上达到与转向向量相当的性能。对未见模型也能实现行为转向，同时在14,000个MMLU评估任务上保持99.9%的性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++提供了一种部署无关的行为控制方法，仅通过视觉输入即可实现多模型的行为转向，为安全关键应用中的VLM行为控制提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: Vision-Zero是一个无需人工标注的视觉语言模型自改进框架，通过任意图像对生成竞争性视觉游戏进行训练，在推理、图表问答等任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前强化学习方法依赖人工标注数据集导致的训练成本高、限制视觉语言模型实际部署的问题。

Method: 提出Vision-Zero框架，包含三个核心：1）策略性自玩框架，让模型在"谁是卧底"式游戏中自主生成训练数据；2）从任意图像生成游戏；3）迭代自玩策略优化算法，结合自玩和带可验证奖励的强化学习。

Result: 尽管使用无标签数据，Vision-Zero在推理、图表问答和视觉中心理解任务上达到最先进性能，超越其他基于标注的方法。

Conclusion: Vision-Zero证明了视觉语言模型可以通过游戏化自玩实现有效的自改进，无需人工标注，具有强大的泛化能力和持续性能提升。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

TL;DR: 提出一种结合数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net的混合方法，用于脉络膜痣的精确分割，在1024*1024眼底图像上达到89.7%的Dice系数和80.01%的IoU，优于Attention U-Net模型。


<details>

Motivation: 脉络膜痣有转化为黑色素瘤的风险，早期检测至关重要。现有AI方法在眼底图像分割中面临挑战，数据集分辨率低、标注不一致，且传统方法需要大量人工输入。

Method: 结合数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net的混合方法，利用两种方法的优势，减少对大规模训练数据的依赖。

Result: 在1024*1024眼底图像上达到89.7%的Dice系数和80.01%的IoU，显著优于Attention U-Net（51.3% Dice和34.2% IoU），在外部数据集上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该混合模型为脉络膜痣诊断决策支持系统开发提供了基础，有望通过自动病灶标注提高诊断和监测的速度与准确性。

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for

Motivation: 现有视觉图神经网络(ViGs)中的节点-邻居特征聚合方法缺乏能够有效捕捉复杂节点-邻居关系且无需架构特定优化的通用方案。

Method: 提出交叉注意力聚合方法，其中查询投影来自节点，键投影来自其邻居；构建AttentionViG架构，使用该聚合方案进行非局部消息传递。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K基准测试中达到SOTA性能；在MS COCO 2017的目标检测和实例分割任务以及ADE20K的语义分割任务中展现出良好的迁移性；在保持效率的同时实现竞争性精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的交叉注意力聚合方法不仅实现了强大的性能，还保持了效率，为视觉图神经网络提供了有效的特征聚合解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了MetaChest大规模胸部X光数据集，用于研究医学图像中的少样本学习，特别关注广义少样本分类场景，发现迁移学习方法在少样本多标签分类任务中表现优于专门设计的少样本学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析中标注数据稀缺，传统少样本学习假设所有类别都是新的，但实际医学应用需要同时学习新类别并利用已有类别知识，这种广义少样本分类场景研究较少。

Method: 构建包含479,215张胸部X光片的MetaChest数据集，设计元集划分和生成多标签episode的算法，评估标准迁移学习方法和ProtoNet扩展在少样本多标签分类任务中的表现。

Result: 增加每个episode的类别数量和每个类别的训练样本数量能提升分类性能；迁移学习方法持续优于ProtoNet扩展；高分辨率图像提高精度但增加计算成本；高效模型架构能以更少资源达到可比性能。

Conclusion: 迁移学习方法在医学图像少样本多标签分类中表现优异，高效模型架构和适当的数据增强策略能平衡性能与计算成本，为实际医学应用提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

TL;DR: K-Prism是一个统一的医学图像分割框架，通过整合语义先验、上下文知识和交互反馈三种知识范式，实现了灵活的多任务分割能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型通常针对单一任务、模态或器官进行训练，与临床实践中专家整合多种知识的实际情况不符。

Method: 将异构知识源编码为双提示表示：1-D稀疏提示定义分割内容，2-D密集提示指示关注区域，通过混合专家解码器进行动态路由。

Result: 在18个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，K-Prism在语义分割、上下文分割和交互分割设置中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: K-Prism成功模拟了临床实践的灵活性，能够在不修改架构的情况下在不同范式间灵活切换并进行跨任务联合训练。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GaussianLens方法，通过按需高斯致密化实现局部高分辨率重建，避免统一高分辨率重建的高成本，专注于用户指定感兴趣区域的细节重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类感知具有选择性注意力特性，在场景重建中需要空间变化的分辨率细节。现有3DGS方法要么输出统一分辨率导致计算成本高，要么需要密集观测和离线优化。需要平衡高分辨率整体重建的高成本和用户对局部精细细节的需求。

Method: 提出GaussianLens前向致密化框架，融合初始3DGS和多视图图像的多模态信息，设计像素引导的致密化机制，在给定低分辨率3DGS重建基础上，基于稀疏高分辨率RoI观测学习可泛化网络来致密化初始3DGS。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了局部高分辨率重建问题，避免了均匀高分辨率重建的高成本和冗余，充分利用了关键区域的高分辨率捕获能力。

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Motivation: 视力威胁性眼病造成重大全球健康负担，及时诊断受到医疗资源短缺和专科护理可及性限制。多模态大语言模型在医学图像解释方面显示潜力，但缺乏适合评估生成式模型的综合基准数据集阻碍了眼科MLLMs的发展。

Conclusion: 将公开发布数据集、整理流程和排行榜，有望推动眼科AI应用发展，减轻视力威胁性疾病的全球负担。

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无锚框的跨视角对象地理定位方法AFGeo，通过直接预测四个方向偏移来定位对象，无需预定义锚框，并结合高斯位置编码和跨视角对象关联模块，在基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角对象地理定位方法大多采用基于锚框的范式，这种方法本质上受到预定义锚框的限制。为了消除这种依赖，作者希望开发一种无锚框的定位方法。

Method: AFGeo直接为每个像素预测到真实框的四个方向偏移（左、右、上、下），从而无需预定义锚框即可定位对象。方法包含高斯位置编码（GPE）来建模查询图像中的点击点位置不确定性，以及跨视角对象关联模块（CVOAM）来关联不同视角下的同一对象及其周围上下文。

Result: 通过采用无锚框定位范式并集成GPE和CVOAM，模型轻量且计算高效，在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AFGeo提供了一种有效的无锚框跨视角对象地理定位方法，消除了对预定义锚框的依赖，同时保持了轻量化和高效性。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态检索模型在处理融合图像-文本模态的检索键时性能下降，而传统方法需要精心构建新的三元组数据集且无法泛化到未见模态组合

Method: GCL通过在mini-batch内对所有模态执行对比学习，利用现有的图像-文本配对数据集学习统一表示空间

Result: 在M-BEIR、MMEB和CoVR基准测试中，GCL在现有多模态检索模型(VISTA、CLIP、TinyCLIP)上均实现了性能提升

Conclusion: GCL能够有效提升多模态检索性能，且无需繁琐的新数据集构建过程

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO的深度学习模型用于工业制造中的自动缺陷检测，使用ConSinGAN进行数据增强来解决金属板图像不足问题，YOLOv9结合ConSinGAN在准确率和检测时间上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中人工缺陷检测耗时耗力的问题，特别是金属板表面和孔洞缺陷检测中数据不足导致的精度下降问题。

Method: 使用ConSinGAN生成大量数据增强金属板图像数据集，比较YOLOv3、v4、v7和v9四个版本模型，将最佳模型集成到制造硬件和SCADA系统中。

Result: YOLOv9模型结合ConSinGAN达到91.3%的准确率，检测时间为146毫秒，性能优于其他YOLO版本。

Conclusion: 提出的YOLOv9模型结合ConSinGAN数据增强方法有效解决了工业缺陷检测中的数据不足问题，建立了实用的自动光学检测系统，并可扩展到其他工业组件检测。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

*Shiyu Wu,Shuyan Li,Jing Li,Jing Liu,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OmniDFA框架，用于AI生成图像的开放集少样本源模型识别，同时构建OmniFake数据集包含117万张来自45个生成模型的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成图像检测和源模型归因的挑战，当前方法容易过拟合特定伪造特征，且缺乏大规模分类合成数据集。

Method: 提出开放集少样本源识别范式，开发OmniDFA框架进行图像真实性评估和少样本源模型归因，构建OmniFake数据集支持研究。

Result: OmniDFA在开放集归因方面表现优异，在AIGI检测上达到最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: OmniDFA框架和OmniFake数据集为AI生成图像检测和归因研究提供了有效解决方案和丰富资源。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIMCoT是一个主动信息驱动的多模态思维链框架，通过上下文增强注意力图生成、主动视觉探测和动态注意力转移触发机制，解决了现有方法依赖不可靠注意力图和被动选择策略的问题，显著提升了多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态思维链方法依赖简单的启发式方法构建交错思维链，通常基于注意力图，但实证分析显示这些注意力图不可靠。此外，其被动无目的的选择策略和任意触发机制在捕捉模型对信息的认知需求方面存在严重不足。

Method: 提出AIMCoT框架，包含三个协同组件：1) 上下文增强注意力图生成，缓解文本-视觉粒度不平衡；2) 主动视觉探测，基于信息论主动选择最能帮助回答问题的图像区域；3) 动态注意力转移触发，通过监控模型文本到视觉的注意力转移智能确定插入视觉信息的最佳时机。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试上进行广泛实验，AIMCoT在不同设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过主动寻找信息和动态构建推理过程，AIMCoT代表了向更鲁棒、有效和类人化多模态推理的关键一步。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

### [29] [How Diffusion Models Memorize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705)
*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型在图像生成中会记忆训练数据，本文通过分析潜在空间动态揭示了记忆机制：早期去噪过程中的训练样本高估是记忆的核心驱动因素，导致多样性减少、去噪轨迹坍缩并加速向记忆图像收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型存在记忆训练数据的问题，引发隐私和版权担忧。虽然已有研究尝试描述、检测和缓解记忆现象，但记忆发生的根本原因仍未解决。本文旨在回答"扩散模型如何记忆"这一核心问题。

Method: 重新审视扩散和去噪过程，分析潜在空间动态。具体包括：(i) 分析训练损失与记忆的关系；(ii) 研究记忆提示如何将训练图像注入噪声预测；(iii) 分解中间潜在变量以观察初始随机性如何被记忆内容替代。

Result: 发现记忆由早期去噪过程中的训练样本高估驱动：无分类器引导会放大预测并导致高估；记忆提示迫使潜在轨迹收敛并引导去噪朝向配对样本；中间潜在变量的分解显示初始随机性被快速抑制并被记忆内容替代。

Conclusion: 早期高估是扩散模型中记忆现象的核心机制，偏离理论去噪计划的程度与记忆严重性高度相关。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Jianzhong You,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProbMED是一种多模态医学视觉语言预训练模型，采用概率对比学习来建模嵌入分布，将四种医学模态对齐到统一的概率嵌入空间，在跨模态检索和分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学视觉语言预训练模型未能直接处理医学信息中常见的多对多映射关系，需要一种能够建模嵌入分布而非确定性估计的方法。

Method: 使用概率对比学习，通过InfoNCE损失和Hellinger距离整合跨模态分布，并引入概率合成采样损失来捕捉模态特定的均值和方差。

Result: 在13个医学数据集上的实验表明，该模型在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务中优于现有Med-VLPMs，并展示了多模态整合的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ProbMED通过概率建模方法有效改善了医学模态间的绑定关系，为医学决策提供了更强大的多模态整合能力。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities--chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text--into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MISP-DPO是一个多模态偏好优化框架，通过引入多个语义多样的负样本图像来解决现有方法依赖简单成对比较的问题，使用Plackett-Luce模型处理多负样本比较，在五个基准测试中显示出更好的多模态对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过度简化的成对比较，通过基本扰动或基于相似性检索生成单个负图像，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉问题。

Method: 在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，应用稀疏自编码器揭示语义偏差为可解释因子，基于重建难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性选择负样本，采用Plackett-Luce目标和重要性采样策略提高训练效率。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试中，MISP-DPO相比先前方法持续改善了多模态对齐效果。

Conclusion: 语义感知的多负样本采样在基于偏好的学习中具有有效性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

TL;DR: SAGE提出了一种统一的视觉地点识别训练框架，通过联合改进局部特征聚合、训练样本组织和困难样本挖掘，增强空间-视觉判别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注描述符微调或固定采样策略，忽略了训练过程中空间上下文和视觉相似性之间的动态交互作用。

Method: 引入轻量级Soft Probing模块学习补丁描述符的残差权重，构建在线地理-视觉图融合地理邻近性和视觉相似性，使用贪婪加权团扩展采样器聚焦信息丰富的地点邻域。

Result: 在8个基准测试中达到SOTA，在SPED、Pitts30k-test、MSLS-val和Nordland上分别获得98.9%、95.8%、94.5%和96.0%的Recall@1，在SPED上仅使用4096D全局描述符就实现了100%的Recall@10。

Conclusion: SAGE通过动态空间-视觉交互建模有效提升了视觉地点识别的性能，证明了联合优化局部特征聚合和样本组织策略的重要性。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and
model will be available at: https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.

TL;DR: LaTo是一个基于地标标记化的扩散变换器，用于细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑，通过量化地标坐标、位置映射编码和基于VLM的地标预测器，在身份保持和语义一致性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态人脸编辑方法在精确属性控制和身份保持方面的不足，特别是当地标条件与源图像差异较大时，传统刚性几何约束会降低身份保持效果。

Method: 提出LaTo框架：1）地标标记器将原始地标坐标量化为离散面部标记；2）位置映射位置编码整合面部和图像标记；3）基于视觉语言模型的地标预测器从指令和源图像推断目标地标。

Result: 在身份保持方面优于现有方法7.8%，在语义一致性方面优于4.6%。构建了HFL-150K数据集，包含15万对真实人脸和细粒度指令。

Conclusion: LaTo通过创新的地标标记化和位置编码方法，实现了细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑，在多个指标上优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对复杂场景下的视频目标分割挑战

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in
complex scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张RGB图像恢复3D人体网格存在固有的模糊性，现有方法要么回归单一确定性输出，要么在准确性和样本多样性之间权衡。需要一种能有效建模姿态参数分布的方法。

Method: 使用SO(3)扩散模型生成3D旋转姿态参数分布，通过条件dropout实现无条件和图像条件生成。采用transformer学习人体关节的层次结构，MLP去噪模型学习基于潜在向量的逐关节分布。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效预测准确的姿态概率分布，在建模3D人体姿态不确定性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 提出的SO(3)扩散模型框架能够有效解决人体网格恢复中的模糊性问题，生成与2D观测对齐的准确姿态分布。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

Motivation: 传统基于拖拽的图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，缺乏3D几何线索，导致在旋转和透视变换等几何密集型场景中产生不精确和不一致的编辑结果。

Method: 提出统一的位移场，联合编码3D几何和2D空间先验；采用无冲突分区策略隔离编辑区域；在单次前向传播中实现连贯编辑。

Conclusion: GeoDrag通过几何引导实现了精确、一致且结构保持的图像编辑，解决了传统方法在几何密集型操作中的局限性。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于体素的方法依赖多视角像素反投影射线交点作为弱几何约束，导致重建质量严重依赖输入视角密度，在重叠区域和未观测区域性能较差

Method: IPDRecon包含三个核心组件：像素级置信度编码器(PCE)、仿射补偿模块(ACM)和图像平面空间解码器(IPSD)，通过物理成像过程解码2D图像中的3D结构信息

Result: 在ScanNetV2上的实验显示，IPDRecon在视角数量减少40%时仍保持近乎相同的重建质量，变异系数仅0.24%，性能保持率99.7%，最大性能下降仅0.42%

Conclusion: 利用单视角内空间信息为实际应用中的视角受限场景提供了鲁棒解决方案

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声在医学中至关重要，但面临操作者依赖性、图像噪声和实时扫描等挑战，阻碍了AI集成。现有大模型难以处理超声的复杂性。

Method: 构建200万规模多模态数据集，采用三阶段训练策略：领域专业化预训练、指令驱动对齐和基于强化的精炼。Dolphin R1通过强化学习增强推理能力。

Result: Dolphin R1在U2-Bench八个超声任务中取得0.5835的U2分数，是第二名模型(0.2968)的两倍多。Dolphin v1.0在分类、检测、回归和报告生成方面表现可靠。

Conclusion: 推理增强训练显著提高了诊断准确性、一致性和可解释性，对高风险医疗AI至关重要。Dolphin系列为超声AI集成提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,
consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes
medical AI.

*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON是一个基于测量引导扩散的虚拟试穿框架，通过线性逆问题重构和轨迹对齐求解器，有效解决非试穿区域的身份背景保持和边界伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法在使用潜在扩散模型时，虽然提升了服装对齐和细节合成能力，但难以保持非试穿区域的原始内容，直接替换策略会导致边界伪影。

Method: 将虚拟试穿重构为线性逆问题，采用轨迹对齐求解器渐进式保持测量一致性；集成基于残差先验的初始化缓解训练-推理不匹配，以及无伪影测量引导采样结合数据一致性、频率级校正和周期性标准去噪。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和SHHQ-1.0数据集上的实验表明，ART-VITON能有效保持身份和背景，消除边界伪影，在视觉保真度和鲁棒性上持续优于现有最优基线。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量引导扩散框架成功解决了虚拟试穿中的非试穿区域保持问题，实现了无伪影的高质量合成。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Jia Jun Cheng Xian,Muchen Li,Haotian Yang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Leonid Sigal,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了文本偏好优化(TPO)框架，通过训练模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示，实现无需配对图像偏好数据的文本到图像模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈的强化学习方法依赖昂贵的配对图像偏好数据或学习的奖励函数，面临可扩展性限制。

Method: 使用大语言模型扰动原始标题构建不匹配提示，训练模型偏好匹配提示，并扩展DPO和KTO算法为TDPO和TKTO。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法持续优于原始方法，提供更好的人类偏好分数和文本到图像对齐效果。

Conclusion: TPO框架实现了"免费午餐"对齐，无需配对图像偏好数据即可有效提升文本到图像模型的对齐性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at
https://github.com/DSL-Lab/T2I-Free-Lunch-Alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: v-HUB是一个新的视觉中心视频幽默理解基准，包含来自无声电影和在线资源的短视频，用于评估多模态大语言模型仅通过视觉线索理解幽默的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和诊断多模态大语言模型理解幽默的能力，特别是在仅通过视觉线索的情况下，这对于增强人机交互的参与度具有实际价值。

Method: 构建v-HUB基准，包含精选的少语言短视频，配有丰富注释（字幕、描述、解释），支持字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务，并构建开放式视频问答任务。

Result: 实验结果显示，所有模型在仅基于视觉线索（无音频）的情况下，字幕匹配性能显著下降。音频的加入有助于视频幽默理解，表明声音信息的重要性。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在仅通过视觉线索理解幽默方面存在困难，整合更丰富的模态（如音频）对于复杂视频理解任务具有前景。

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PCPO框架来解决文本到图像模型强化学习训练中的不稳定性问题，通过比例信用分配机制显著提升收敛速度和图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的策略梯度方法在文本到图像模型对齐中存在训练不稳定和高方差问题，阻碍收敛速度并影响图像质量

Method: 引入比例信用策略优化(PCPO)框架，通过稳定的目标重构和时间步的合理重加权来强制执行比例信用分配

Result: PCPO显著稳定了训练过程，加速收敛并提升图像质量，在所有方面都大幅优于现有策略梯度基线方法

Conclusion: PCPO通过解决不成比例信用分配问题，有效缓解了模型崩溃这一递归训练中的常见故障模式

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

*Mingyu Kang,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ENM Inversion的新反演技术，通过搜索最优噪声图来同时保证内容保持和可编辑性，解决了现有方法在文本引导图像编辑中难以紧密遵循目标文本提示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反演方法虽然能够忠实重建源图像，但限制了编辑所需的灵活性，导致难以紧密遵循目标文本提示进行编辑。

Method: 分析噪声图特性以增强可编辑性，引入可编辑噪声精炼，通过最小化重建噪声图和编辑噪声图之间的差异来与期望编辑对齐。

Result: 大量实验表明，ENM Inversion在广泛的图像编辑任务中，在内容保持和编辑保真度方面均优于现有方法，并能轻松应用于视频编辑。

Conclusion: ENM Inversion通过优化噪声图搜索，有效平衡了内容重建和编辑灵活性，为文本引导的图像和视频编辑提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoQuality是一个无需人工标注的自监督框架，通过自一致性原则和群体相对策略优化，让视觉语言模型在图像质量评估任务中自主提升感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的后训练通常依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，而自监督方法在感知领域如图像质量评估中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用自一致性原则，通过成对多数投票生成伪标签，建立相对质量共识，然后通过群体相对策略优化进行迭代进化。

Result: 在零样本设置下，基础模型的PLCC性能提升了31.8%，在7个IQA基准测试中，有5个超越了最先进的监督VLM模型。

Conclusion: EvoQuality证明完全自监督的方法可以在图像质量评估任务中达到甚至超越监督方法的性能，为视觉语言模型的自主进化提供了新途径。

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingECG是一种概率性师生模型，利用不确定性感知的ECG嵌入和ECHO监督来改进基于ECG的心脏功能预测，在零样本、少样本和微调设置中优于现有ECG基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图(ECG)因其低成本和可及性被广泛用于评估心脏功能。研究表明ECG可以预测传统上需要更复杂模态(如超声心动图ECHO)获得的关键结果，使ECG成为预测心脏功能的更便捷方法。ECHO需要大量医院资源但在临床心脏评估中起关键作用。

Method: 提出EchoingECG概率师生模型，整合概率跨模态嵌入(PCME++)和ECHO-CLIP(在ECHO-文本对上预训练的视觉语言模型)，将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中。

Result: 实验和外部验证显示，EchoingECG在基于ECG的ECHO预测的零样本、少样本和微调设置中优于最先进的ECG基础模型。方差估计增强了模型性能理解，识别了ECG中的不确定性区域。

Conclusion: EchoingECG通过概率性跨模态知识蒸馏有效提升了ECG在心脏功能预测中的表现，同时提供了不确定性估计来增强模型可解释性。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了Point-It-Out基准，通过精确视觉定位系统评估视觉语言模型的具身推理能力，发现GPT-4o等通用模型在精确视觉定位方面表现不如某些开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要通过基于图像标注的多选题评估VLMs的具身推理能力，缺乏对精确视觉定位能力的系统评估。

Method: 设计了分层评估协议（S1：参考对象定位，S2：任务驱动指向，S3：视觉轨迹预测），在室内、厨房、驾驶和机器人操作等关键领域收集数据。

Result: 对10多个最先进VLM的广泛实验显示，GPT-4o等强通用模型在精确视觉定位方面表现不如某些开源模型；MoLMO在S1和S2表现良好但在需要视觉轨迹规划的S3中表现不佳。

Conclusion: PIO基准揭示了VLMs在精确视觉定位方面的局限性，强调了在具身推理应用中开发专门视觉定位能力的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DSGA模块，结合LoRA在极少量数据下微调SAM模型，用于农业图像中密集小物体的精确分割，仅需4.00M可训练参数，在多个指标上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业计算机视觉任务中训练数据有限和田间条件复杂的问题，特别是在极少量数据下对基础模型进行参数高效微调的挑战。

Method: 引入动态相似性图适应(DSGA)模块，通过可学习多项式衰减初始化权重排序机制构建动态相似性图，结合自适应局部特征聚合，并与LoRA集成形成互补优化框架。

Result: 在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上，DSGA+LoRA在2、4、8、10样本设置下均表现优异，结构度量提升17.31%，自适应F度量提升62.36%，最终实现精确豆荚计数(R²=0.8987)。

Conclusion: 该框架在极少量数据下有效捕获图像嵌入的局部和全局依赖关系，同时保持模型稳定性和参数效率，为自动化农业监测应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型主要评估在通用基准上，在智能产品审核等特定领域应用不足。传统logo识别方法需要记忆大量品牌表示，在实际场景中不实用。

Method: 将logo识别重新定义为基于比较的任务，匹配产品图像与候选logo而非直接生成品牌标签。引入Logo Perception Grounding注入领域知识，Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning增强推理能力。

Result: Logo-VGR在OOD设置下比强基线方法高出近10个点，展现出优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: Logo-VGR通过领域特定的多模态推理方法，有效解决了logo识别中的泛化问题，在智能产品审核等实际应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the state-
of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing data, we
organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023. The
training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于奖励引导的图像编辑框架，将编辑过程建模为轨迹最优控制问题，在保持源图像语义内容的同时增强目标奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于奖励引导的方法主要用于图像生成，但在图像编辑任务中应用较少。图像编辑需要在保持源图像语义内容的同时增强特定目标奖励，这是一个尚未充分探索的研究方向。

Method: 将扩散模型的反向过程视为从源图像出发的可控轨迹，通过迭代更新伴随状态来引导编辑过程，将其建模为轨迹最优控制问题。

Result: 在多种不同编辑任务上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于反转的无训练引导基线，在奖励最大化和源图像保真度之间实现了更好的平衡，且不会出现奖励作弊。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于奖励引导的图像编辑提供了一种有效的训练免费解决方案，能够在不牺牲图像质量的情况下实现目标奖励的优化。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

TL;DR: 论文发现多模态推理在增强逻辑推理能力的同时可能损害视觉感知基础，提出VAPO方法来解决视觉遗忘问题，在多个基准测试中取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态推理在视觉任务中表现出色，但研究发现它会逐渐损害模型的感知基础能力，导致基本视觉问题识别失败，这种现象被称为视觉遗忘。

Method: 提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法，通过明确引导推理过程朝向视觉基础轨迹，增强模型对视觉信息的依赖。

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B模型显著增强了模型对视觉信息的依赖，在多个基准测试中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: VAPO方法有效解决了多模态推理中的视觉遗忘问题，平衡了推理能力和感知基础，为多模态模型的发展提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态符号逻辑推理在高风险应用中至关重要，其严谨的确定性推理有助于防止严重后果。需要评估当前最先进视觉语言模型在这方面的能力。

Method: 构建MuSLR基准，包含1093个实例，涵盖35个原子符号逻辑和976个逻辑组合，推理深度从2到9。提出LogiCAM模块化框架，将形式逻辑规则应用于多模态输入。

Result: 评估7个最先进视觉语言模型发现它们都在多模态符号推理方面表现不佳，GPT-4.1最佳但仅46.8%。LogiCAM将GPT-4.1的思维链性能提升14.13%，在复杂逻辑如一阶逻辑上提升更大。错误分析显示约70%失败源于模态间逻辑不对齐。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在多模态符号逻辑推理方面存在显著不足，LogiCAM框架能有效提升性能。模态间逻辑不对齐是主要挑战，为未来改进提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All
data and code are publicly available at https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR.

TL;DR: 提出了PatchEAD框架，一种无需训练的异常检测方法，专注于视觉补丁处理，兼容多种基础模型，在少样本和零样本场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工业异常检测主要依赖文本提示调优，而视觉处理部分分散在不同基础模型中，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 提出统一的补丁聚焦框架PatchEAD，包含对齐模块和前景掩码等视觉提示技术，无需训练即可实现异常检测。

Result: 实验显示在少样本和批量零样本场景下优于先前工作，即使不使用文本特征也能取得优异性能。

Conclusion: 统一的补丁框架可以实现快速、轻量校准的部署，无需精心设计的文本提示，为实际视觉检测提供实用指导。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Motivation: 融合相机数据和LiDAR测量以增强空间理解，特别是在低光照条件下保持鲁棒性，同时简化系统设置流程。

Method: 使用初始校准确定相机内参，自动计算LiDAR与相机间的几何变换，无需专用校准目标；采用色彩校正确保相机数据一致性，集成低光图像增强模块。

Result: 使用Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR和四相机配置测试，优化软件实现实时性能，在极低光照下可靠着色，成功恢复原本不可检测的场景细节。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、鲁棒的LiDAR点云彩色化解决方案，特别适用于低光照环境，简化了系统设置并实现了实时处理。

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖切片级提示，无法捕捉对癌症诊断至关重要的组织学实体（如细胞核、腺体）的亚型特异性表型变异，限制了少样本病理诊断的性能。

Result: 在三个癌症队列上的实验结果表明，该方法在解决少样本病理诊断任务方面具有有效性。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过整合多尺度视觉语义和分层预测机制，显著提升了少样本全切片图像分类的性能，为病理诊断提供了更精细的表型分析能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"图像思维"范式在数据构建准确性、结构设计和应用场景方面仍有很大探索空间，需要进一步推进多模态推理的发展。

Method: 构建包含31k条思维链推理轨迹的数据集，并设计直接在视觉嵌入空间生成"视觉思维"的模型，避免调用外部工具和重复编码生成图像。

Result: 在多模态推理基准测试中表现出强大性能，验证了数据集的有效性和模型设计的优越性。

Conclusion: DeepSketcher通过工具无关的视觉思维生成，为多模态推理提供了更灵活有效的解决方案，推动了"图像思维"范式的发展。

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation
annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation.
mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across
multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the
first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型进入交互式多轮使用，出现了单轮或单模态审核无法应对的新安全风险。在多模态多轮对话中，恶意意图可能分布在多个轮次和图像中，而上下文敏感的回复仍可能推进有害内容。

Method: 基于蒙特卡洛树搜索开发了自动多模态多轮红队框架来生成不安全的多模态多轮对话，构建了包含4,484个标注样本的MMDS数据集，并开发了LLaVAShield工具来联合检测和评估用户输入和助手回复中的风险。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态多轮对话安全提供了系统性框架和工具，通过MMDS数据集和LLaVAShield模型有效解决了多轮多模态对话中的安全挑战。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型擅长高层次场景理解，但在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务中表现不佳，因为语言中心架构难以生成精确的数值坐标。

Method: 采用混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和双视觉编码器生成包含丰富语义和空间信息的区域标记，通过基于标记的引用系统使LLM能够对这些视觉区域进行推理和定位。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中达到最先进性能，在目标定位、区域生成理解和视觉区域推理方面表现出色，且不损害基础模型的通用视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1为构建感知感知的视觉语言模型建立了有效灵活的模式，弥合了高层次推理与细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了训练数据特性对深度神经网络对抗鲁棒性的影响，发现数据量和模型规模遵循对数缩放定律，但数据质量、架构和训练目标比原始规模对实现广谱对抗鲁棒性更为关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络架构和训练范式有所进步，但仍然容易受到对抗样本的攻击。研究旨在探索训练数据特性如何影响对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 评估了36个最先进的视觉模型，涵盖监督、自监督和对比学习方法，在1.2M到22B图像的数据集上训练。在六种黑盒攻击类别下进行评估：随机扰动、两种几何掩码、COCO对象操作、ImageNet-C损坏和ImageNet-R风格偏移。

Result: 鲁棒性随数据量和模型规模遵循对数缩放定律：数据量增加十倍，攻击成功率平均降低约3.2%；模型规模增加十倍，攻击成功率平均降低约13.4%。自监督模型在精选数据集上的表现优于在更大但较少精选数据集上训练的模型。对抗微调改善了结构变化的泛化能力，但对颜色分布的泛化能力没有改善。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展规模能提高鲁棒性，但数据质量、架构和训练目标在实现广谱对抗鲁棒性方面比原始规模起着更决定性的作用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Conclusion: UniMMAD为多模态多类异常检测提供了统一的解决方案，有效解决了领域干扰和边界失真问题，在保持高效的同时实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

TL;DR: 提出SS-ACL框架，无需专家标注即可生成基于视觉证据的医学报告，通过自监督解剖一致性学习实现报告与解剖区域的自动对齐。

Motivation: 现有方法依赖单独训练的检测模块，需要大量专家标注，成本高且因病理分布偏差导致泛化能力有限。

Method: 构建分层解剖图，利用人体解剖的固有包含结构组织空间实体；通过递归重建细粒度解剖区域实现空间对齐；引入基于解剖一致性的区域级对比学习增强语义对齐。

Conclusion: SS-ACL框架有效解决了医学报告生成中的标注依赖问题，通过自监督学习实现了准确且可解释的视觉基础医学报告生成。

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Conclusion: 提出的追踪框架能有效解决水下鲑鱼场景的跟踪挑战，为自动化鲑鱼福利监测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available

Motivation: 现有交互式分割方法局限于粗粒度的实例级目标，而非交互式方法在处理稀疏真实世界扫描时表现不佳，且缺乏标注数据。

Method: 开发了新的3D数据合成流水线创建大规模场景级数据集，提出交互式框架通过用户点点击实现细粒度分割。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了在复杂3D环境中实现更细致和精确的机器感知与交互的重要进展。

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RH-Partial2Global方法，通过结合jackknife conformal prediction和covering design-based sampling，改进了视觉上下文学习中的示例选择机制，解决了现有方法相似性假设缺乏理论依据和随机采样导致覆盖不完整的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VICL方法基于相似性优先假设选择上下文示例，但这一假设缺乏充分的理论依据；同时Partial2Global依赖随机采样构建全局排序，导致覆盖不完整和冗余比较，影响最终排序质量。

Method: 提出RH-Partial2Global方法：1）使用jackknife conformal prediction构建可靠的替代集合；2）采用covering design-based sampling确保成对偏好的全面均匀覆盖。

Result: 大量实验表明，RH-Partial2Global在多种视觉任务中表现出色，性能优于Partial2Global方法。

Conclusion: RH-Partial2Global通过更可靠的替代集合构建和更全面的采样策略，有效提升了视觉上下文学习中示例选择的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑模型因传统注意力机制的二次计算复杂度，难以适应长时长和高分辨率视频，限制了实时视频处理等实际应用。

Method: 将线性时空聚合模块集成到基于扩散的视频模型中，利用RWKV变换器的双向加权键值循环机制捕获全局依赖并保持时间一致性。

Result: 相比最先进的基于扩散的视频编辑方法，实现3.7倍加速和60%内存使用降低，同时在帧一致性和文本对齐方面保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在长视频编辑中与自注意力架构的速度差距更加显著，为高效视频编辑提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Conclusion: 利用自然语言叙述作为弱监督信号是有效的，可以在不使用细粒度像素标注的情况下实现有竞争力的手持物体分割性能。

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

TL;DR: 提出了AgenticIQA框架，将视觉语言模型与传统图像质量评估工具动态结合，通过任务分解和智能体协作实现更准确的质量评分和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像质量评估方法使用固定模型输出标量分数，难以适应不同失真类型、用户特定查询和可解释性需求。评分和解释通常被分开处理，但实际上相互依赖。

Method: 将IQA分解为四个子任务：失真检测、失真分析、工具选择和工具执行，由规划器、执行器和总结器协调完成。规划器制定任务特定策略，执行器通过工具调用收集感知证据，总结器整合证据生成准确分数和人类对齐的解释。

Result: 在多个IQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，AgenticIQA在评分准确性和解释对齐方面持续超越强基线方法。

Conclusion: AgenticIQA框架通过模块化智能体方法有效解决了传统IQA方法的局限性，实现了更准确和可解释的图像质量评估。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

Motivation: 利用针孔和鱼眼图像的互补特性（无失真vs失真、小FOVvs大FOV、远场vs近场）进行联合优化，解决异质多视角深度估计问题。

Result: 在KITTI-360和RealHet数据集上超越了当前主流深度网络，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究异质针孔-鱼眼深度估计的工作，既提供了技术新颖性，也提供了有价值的实证见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

Method: 构建四阶非线性PDE模型，结合拉普拉斯算子和强度值的扩散过程，以及保持细节的波动部分；对彩色图像分别处理每个通道以保持结构和颜色一致性。

Result: 使用PSNR、MSSIM和SI指标评估，在所有情况下相比现有模型都产生了更好的结果，在灰度图和彩色图像上均表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的四阶非线性PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声方面优于传统的二阶各向异性扩散方法，能有效减少噪声同时保持图像细节和纹理。

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

TL;DR: SETR提出了一种语义增强的两阶段检索方法，通过交集驱动策略过滤干扰信息，并使用多模态LLM进行细粒度重排序，在零样本组合图像检索任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP方法在零样本组合图像检索中的两个核心问题：基于并集的特征融合会携带不相关的背景细节，以及全局余弦相似度无法解析细粒度语义关系。

Method: 两阶段检索框架：1）粗检索阶段使用交集驱动策略保留参考图像和相对文本的重叠语义；2）重排序阶段使用低秩适配的多模态LLM进行二元语义相关性判断。

Result: 在CIRR、Fashion-IQ和CIRCO数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在CIRR上的Recall@1提升了15.15个百分点。

Conclusion: 两阶段推理为鲁棒且可移植的零样本组合图像检索提供了一个通用范式。

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

Motivation: 解决遥感数据与OSM数据之间的模态差异（数据结构、内容和空间粒度不同），使遥感基础模型能够有效利用丰富的地理上下文信息。

Method: 在预训练阶段使用OSM数据提供的多粒度学习信号，通过跨模态空间相关性指导信息交互；引入图像掩码重建实现稀疏输入。在下游任务中生成单模态和多模态细粒度编码。

Conclusion: 多模态协同在推进高级地理空间人工智能方面具有巨大潜力，空间相关性在多模态地理数据整合中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

Motivation: 预训练视频生成模型在视频超分辨率方面潜力巨大，但现有方法采用全尺寸处理存在计算密集和输出分辨率固定的问题，需要探索更高效的分块式方法。

Method: 提出PatchVSR方法，包含双流适配器：补丁分支提取输入补丁特征保持内容保真度，全局分支从缩放全视频提取上下文特征；注入补丁位置信息；设计多补丁联合调制确保视觉一致性。

Result: 实验证明该方法能在补丁级别合成高保真、高分辨率细节，基于512×512基础模型实现极具竞争力的4K视频超分辨率，且效率极高。

Conclusion: 分块式范式具有灵活性优势，能够高效实现高质量视频超分辨率，为预训练视频扩散模型在超分辨率任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

Result: 在WILDS基准测试Camelyon17上表现出优于现有OOD基线的持续性能提升

Conclusion: 因果扰动作为可靠且可解释的泛化工具具有潜力

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，解决了CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在少样本分类中存在模态内不对齐问题，由持续模态间隙和仅跨模态训练目标导致，使图像间直接比较不可靠。现有方法要么优化相似度logits，要么进行昂贵的逐样本优化。

Method: 提出SeMoBridge方法，通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，保持语义内容不变。该方法为闭式解，可选择通过多模态监督训练，结合图像和文本对齐损失优化投影。

Result: 实验表明，训练版本SeMoBridge-T仅需少量训练时间，整体性能优于其他方法，在低数据场景（1、2、4样本）表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge有效解决了CLIP的模态内不对齐问题，在少样本分类中实现了高效且强大的性能。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Urawee Thani,Ki Fung Wong,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩展HAMMER模型以处理全局场景不一致性（如前景-背景不匹配），通过轻量级分割引导评分(SGS)管道增强检测能力，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER在多模态操作检测中表现优异，但在处理上下文不匹配的主要主体时存在局限性，需要解决标签空间偏差、局部注意力焦点和虚假文本-前景对齐问题。

Method: 提出分割引导评分(SGS)管道：使用人物/面部分割掩码分离前景和背景区域，通过联合视觉语言模型提取嵌入，计算区域感知一致性分数，并与HAMMER原始预测融合。

Result: SGS显著提高了对全局操作的鲁棒性，改进了二元检测、定位和标记级解释，且仅需推理阶段，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了区域感知推理在多模态虚假信息检测中的重要性，为现有模型提供了无需重新训练的增强方案。

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩展DGM4数据集，新增5000个包含前景-背景不匹配及其与文本操作混合的高质量样本，创建DGM4+基准来测试检测器在局部和全局推理上的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGM4数据集仅限于局部操作（如人脸交换、属性编辑和字幕更改），但现实世界伪造中普遍存在全局不一致性（如前景背景不匹配），这构成了关键的研究空白。

Method: 使用OpenAI的gpt-image-1和精心设计的提示生成以人为中心的新闻风格图像，将真实人物置于荒谬或不可能的背景下，并生成三种字幕条件：字面、文本属性和文本分割。

Result: 创建了三个新的操作类别：FG-BG、FG-BG+TA和FG-BG+TS，并通过质量控制管道确保数据质量，包括可见人脸数量控制、感知哈希去重、基于OCR的文本清理和真实标题长度。

Conclusion: DGM4+数据集通过引入全局操作补充了现有数据集，为多模态模型（如HAMMER）的评估提供了更全面的基准，这些模型目前在处理前景-背景不一致性方面存在困难。

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at
https://github.com/Gaganx0/DGM4plus

TL;DR: 提出一种基于主纤维丛截面理论的几何学习方法，用于在分类任务中消除对称性影响，避免数据增强，构建更可持续的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉和医学应用中的数据集通常包含对称性（如旋转、缩放等），传统方法使用数据增强来处理这些对称性，但这种方法不够可持续。

Method: 使用主纤维丛的截面概念来消除对称性，通过优化截面来最大化类别分离，并在曲线轮廓数据集上应用该方法处理平移、旋转、缩放和重参数化等对称性。

Result: 开发了一个包含恒定速度参数化作为特例的2参数曲线规范参数化族，并提供了可用的代码实现和教程。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了处理对称性的几何框架，具有广泛的应用潜力，避免了数据增强的需求。

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用基础模型生成3D伪标签，结合时序信息进行标签稠密化，显著提升语义占据预测性能，避免了传统自监督方法的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督学习方法如新视角合成、跨视图渲染等计算成本高、内存占用大，且难以迁移到其他架构。需要一种更高效、可迁移的方法来提升语义占据预测性能。

Method: 使用Grounded-SAM和Metric3Dv2基础模型生成3D伪标签，利用时序信息进行标签稠密化，提出EasyOcc模型仅从伪标签学习，避免复杂渲染策略。

Result: 在OccNeRF模型上mIoU从9.73提升至14.09（提升45%），EasyOcc模型达到13.86 mIoU，在不使用相机掩码的全场景评估中达到7.71 mIoU，超越之前最佳模型31%。

Conclusion: 基础模型、时序上下文和损失计算空间选择在自监督学习的全面场景理解中具有关键重要性，提出的方法高效且可迁移性强。

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点球常决定冠军归属，但守门员必须在极短时间内从细微的生物力学线索预判踢球者意图。

Method: 双分支架构：MobileNetV2 CNN提取RGB帧空间特征，LSTM网络处理2D关键点并带注意力机制，姿态关键点引导视觉关注任务相关区域，基于距离的阈值方法分割输入序列。

Result: 在755个点球事件数据集上，模型在测试集上达到89%准确率，比纯视觉和纯姿态基线提升14-22%，推理时间22毫秒。

Conclusion: 轻量级且可解释的设计适用于守门员训练、战术分析和实时比赛分析。

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

Motivation: 解决现有文本到场景方法在处理复杂几何结构、物体变换和复杂指令遵循方面的局限性。

Method: 整合基于物理、功能和上下文属性的物体检索，基于隐式和显式布局约束进行物体放置，并通过碰撞感知的空间推理优化位置。

Result: 在从简单到复杂的室内配置指令评估中，Reason-3D在视觉保真度、约束遵循和资产检索质量方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推动了文本到场景生成领域的发展，还展示了现代大型推理模型的高级空间推理能力，并发布了代码库以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

TL;DR: EVODiff提出了一种基于信息论的扩散模型推理方法，通过优化条件熵来系统性地降低去噪过程中的不确定性，显著提升了生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但存在推理速度慢和训练-推理差异的问题。现有的梯度求解器缺乏信息传输效率的理论基础。

Method: 从信息论角度分析扩散模型推理过程，提出条件熵优化方法EVODiff，通过优化条件方差来最小化转换和重构误差。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，EVODiff将重构误差降低45.5%（FID从5.10提升到2.78）；在ImageNet-256上，将NFE成本降低25%（从20减少到15）；同时改善了文本到图像生成质量并减少了伪影。

Conclusion: 信息论视角为扩散模型推理提供了新的理论基础，EVODiff方法在生成质量和效率方面均优于现有最先进的梯度求解器。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen是一个基于视觉自回归模型的主题驱动生成框架，通过双路径注入策略解决现有方法在效率和零样本能力之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主题驱动生成方法存在明显权衡：要么依赖计算昂贵的逐主题微调，牺牲效率和零样本能力；要么使用基于扩散模型的前馈架构，但推理速度缓慢。视觉自回归模型具有快速采样速度和强大生成质量，是解决这一矛盾的理想基础。

Method: 提出EchoGen框架，采用双路径注入策略：语义编码器提取主题的抽象身份，通过解耦交叉注意力注入以指导整体构图；内容编码器捕获精细视觉细节，通过多模态注意力机制集成以确保高保真纹理和结构保留。

Result: 定量和定性结果验证了设计有效性，EchoGen在主题保真度和图像质量上可与最先进的基于扩散的方法相媲美，同时显著降低了采样延迟。

Conclusion: EchoGen是首个基于VAR模型的前馈主题驱动框架，成功解决了主题驱动生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，为快速高质量的主题驱动生成提供了新方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出EntroPE框架，通过条件熵动态检测时间序列中的过渡点来构建动态补丁，保持时间连贯性，提高预测精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于补丁的时间序列预测方法采用时间无关的补丁构建方式，任意起始位置和固定长度会破坏时间连贯性，分裂自然过渡，削弱表示学习。

Method: EntroPE包含两个关键模块：基于熵的动态补丁器（EDP）使用信息论标准定位自然时间变化点确定补丁边界；自适应补丁编码器（APE）使用池化和交叉注意力捕获补丁内依赖关系生成固定大小潜在表示。

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中，EntroPE在准确性和效率方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 熵引导的动态补丁构建为时间序列建模提供了一个有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a
scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated,

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

Motivation: 虽然许多检测模型致力于降低漏检率和处理遮挡、远距离识别等挑战，但公平性仍然是一个未被充分探索但同样重要的问题。

Method: 在ECP-DP数据集上评估了5个行人专用检测器和3个通用模型，使用EOD指标量化公平性，并通过Z检验评估统计显著性和鲁棒性。

Result: 发现检测器对平行腿、直肘和侧向视角的行人存在偏见；下半身关节遮挡比上半身和头部遮挡对检测率的影响更大；Cascade R-CNN总体漏检率最低且在所有属性上偏差最小。

Conclusion: 这是首个在自动驾驶行人检测中进行的全面姿态和遮挡感知的公平性评估，揭示了现有模型的系统性偏见。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose--including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation--as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriGen是一个用于计算机视觉中自动化细粒度多属性标注的新框架，特别针对细胞显微镜领域，通过双模型架构实现细胞类型分类和多属性分类，达到94.62%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细胞显微镜领域，多属性分类相比传统的细胞类型分类研究较少，需要开发自动化方法来提高标注效率和模型可解释性。

Method: 使用两个互补数据集（PBC和WBCAtt），提出双模型架构：CNN用于细胞类型分类，Vision Transformer用于多属性分类。

Result: 在多属性分类上达到94.62%的准确率，显著提高模型可解释性，相比传统人工标注节省大量时间和成本。

Conclusion: AttriGen建立了一个可扩展到其他计算机视觉分类任务的新范式，有效自动化多属性标签的扩展。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

Conclusion: GSDD方法简单有效，适用于不同蒸馏流程，具有高度可扩展性，为数据集蒸馏提供了高效的稀疏表示解决方案

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

TL;DR: 提出MGCE框架解决广义类别发现问题，通过多粒度概念专家自适应挖掘视觉概念，无需预先知道未标记数据的类别数量，在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要局限：1) 未能充分利用视觉数据中的多粒度概念信息；2) 大多假设训练时已知未标记类别数量，这在现实场景中不实用。

Method: MGCE包含两个模块：动态概念对比学习(DCCL)交替进行概念挖掘和双级表示学习；多粒度专家协作学习(MECL)引入不同粒度的专家并使用概念对齐矩阵进行跨专家协作。

Result: 在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上实现SOTA，特别是在新类别准确率方面表现突出。即使不知道类别数量，MGCE仍优于需要知道确切类别数量的参数化方法，平均提升3.6%。

Conclusion: MGCE框架能够自动估计未标记数据中的类别数量，适用于实际的开放世界设置，为广义类别发现提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is

Motivation: 解决扩散生成图像与输入提示之间的精确多模态对齐问题，现有方法要么依赖有限的高质量偏好数据，要么通过编辑局部区域可能损害整体图像质量。

Method: 提出隐式多模态引导(IMG)：1) 使用MLLM识别未对齐区域；2) 引入隐式对齐器操作扩散条件特征；3) 制定可训练目标——迭代更新偏好目标。

Result: 在SDXL、SDXL-DPO和FLUX上的定性和定量评估显示，IMG优于现有对齐方法，并能作为即插即用适配器增强现有基于微调的对齐方法。

Conclusion: IMG提供了一种无需额外数据或编辑操作的有效多模态对齐解决方案，具有良好的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型如Donut虽然有效，但计算成本过高，不适合实时或资源受限的应用场景。

Method: 利用机制可解释性分析内部计算，识别关键子组件，通过知识蒸馏训练紧凑学生模型，并进行网络修剪。

Result: 开发出Donut-MINT，在DocVQA基准测试上保持强性能的同时减少了推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法将压缩重新定义为电路发现，连接了可解释性研究和实用的视觉语言模型部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LAMs存在两个瓶颈：端到端训练的视觉编码器空间理解能力差，以及输入帧距离较远时系统脆弱导致时间感知有限，这阻碍了稳定清晰的动作建模。

Method: 提出Farsighted-LAM框架，包含几何感知空间编码和多尺度时间建模，从连续帧中捕捉结构先验和动态运动模式。进一步构建SSM-VLA端到端框架，集成结构化感知和视觉思维链模块来显式推理环境动态。

Result: 在多个VLA任务的仿真和真实环境测试中达到最先进性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合几何感知建模、时间一致性和显式推理的策略能有效增强具身智能的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision- Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action rep- resentations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry- aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end- to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates
structured perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly
reason about environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and
interpretability. We validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation
and real- world settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results
demonstrate that our strategy of combining geometry- aware modeling, temporal
coherence, and explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 合成媒体的快速发展使深度伪造检测成为在线安全和信任的关键挑战，但现有方法受限于高质量数据集稀缺，且多模态大语言模型在深度伪造检测中表现不佳，常产生与视觉证据不符或幻觉的解释。

Method: 引入带推理标注的深度伪造检测数据集，并提出段落级别相对策略优化（PRPO）强化学习算法，在段落级别对齐LLM推理与图像内容。

Result: PRPO大幅提高了检测准确率，获得4.55/5.0的最高推理分数，消融研究显示PRPO在测试条件下显著优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 将多模态推理基于视觉证据对于实现更可靠和可解释的深度伪造检测至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于聚类的仿射变换（CAT）方法，用于改善低比特后训练量化（PTQ）的精度，通过使用聚类特定参数来对齐量化输出与全精度输出，无需微调模型或量化参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的仿射变换在低比特PTQ中会恶化结果，因为对所有输出使用统一的仿射参数集无法有效减少量化模型与全精度模型之间的信息差异。

Method: 提出Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT)框架，使用聚类特定参数来精炼低比特量化输出，仅需少量额外参数，无需模型或量化参数微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，该框架在多种架构和低比特设置下始终优于现有PTQ方法，在W2A2 ResNet-18上达到53.18%的Top-1准确率，作为插件使用时可将现有PTQ基线提升3%以上。

Conclusion: CAT是一种有效的误差减少框架，能够显著改善低比特后训练量化的精度，具有实用性和推广价值。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like
feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an
AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点监督方法存在两个缺陷：伪标签利用率低和伪标签质量差。为了减少昂贵的人工标注成本，需要开发更有效的弱监督学习方法。

Method: 1) 渐进式标签分配(PLA)：在不同训练阶段以粗略但智能的方式动态估计实例大小，从而使用标签分配方法。2) 先验引导动态掩码损失(PGDM-Loss)：结合了Voronoi分水岭损失和SAM模型的优势，克服了分水岭在稀疏场景和SAM在密集场景中的性能不足。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了竞争性性能：DOTA-v1.0(66.09%)、DOTA-v1.5(56.86%)、DOTA-v2.0(41.28%)、DIOR(46.40%)、STAR(19.60%)、RSAR(45.96%)，特别在物体尺寸变化大或稀疏场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3是首个使用动态伪标签进行标签分配的模型，创新性地结合了SAM模型和分水岭算法的优势，在稀疏和密集场景中都能取得优秀性能。

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

Motivation: 开发一个能够利用预训练流模型解决各种逆问题的统一框架，同时实现高质量重建和理论上的贝叶斯后验采样近似。

Method: 采用三步迭代过程：(i) 流一致性目标估计，速度网络预测去噪目标；(ii) 精炼步骤，将估计目标投影到前向算子定义的可行集；(iii) 时间推进步骤，沿流轨迹重新投影精炼后的目标。

Conclusion: Flower成功统一了即插即用方法和生成式逆求解器的视角，通过理论分析证明了其近似贝叶斯后验采样的能力，并在实践中展现了优异的性能和通用性。

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along

*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D视频傅里叶场(VFF)的连续时空视频超分辨率方法，通过神经编码器预测傅里叶系数，实现了任意时空位置的无混叠采样和重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视频分解为空间和时间分量，依赖脆弱的显式帧扭曲进行运动补偿，存在局限性。需要一种能够同时捕捉精细空间细节和平滑时间动态的联合表示方法。

Method: 将视频编码为连续、时空相干的3D视频傅里叶场(VFF)，使用具有大时空感受野的神经编码器预测傅里叶基系数，并包含高斯点扩散函数进行无混叠重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在广泛的放大因子范围内，比现有基线提供更清晰、时间更一致的重建结果，同时计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 联合建模方法显著改善了空间和时间超分辨率性能，证明了连续傅里叶场表示在视频超分辨率任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE是一个无需训练的两阶段零样本组合图像检索框架，利用多模态大语言模型增强检索性能，通过语义查询增强融合和高效批量重排序来更好地捕捉用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合图像检索(CIR)旨在检索既保留参考图像视觉内容又融入用户文本修改的目标图像。无需特定训练或标注数据的零样本CIR方法很有吸引力，但准确捕捉用户意图仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 语义查询增强融合阶段：用MLLM生成的目标图像描述丰富VLM的查询嵌入，提供高层语义指导；2) 高效批量重排序阶段：将排名靠前的候选图像以带视觉标记的网格形式呈现给MLLM，进行联合视觉语义推理。

Result: 在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现出色，即使使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: SQUARE以其简单性和有效性，在零样本组合图像检索中实现了强大的性能，展示了其潜在适用性。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为\mname的奖励模型，通过大规模人类偏好数据集训练，解决了开源图像编辑模型缺乏可靠奖励模型的问题，显著提升了指令引导图像编辑任务中的人类偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源图像编辑模型落后于闭源模型的主要瓶颈是缺乏可靠的奖励模型来扩展高质量合成训练数据。

Method: 构建了\mname奖励模型，使用包含20万对偏好数据的大规模人类偏好数据集进行训练，该数据集由训练有素的专家按照严格协议标注。

Result: \mname在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的人类相关性，包括GenAI-Bench、AURORA-Bench、ImagenHub和新的\benchname，超越了广泛的VLM-as-judge模型。使用\mname筛选ShareGPT-4o-Image数据集的高质量子集，训练的Step1X-Edit模型相比完整数据集训练有显著提升。

Conclusion: \mname能够作为奖励模型扩展高质量图像编辑训练数据，其强对齐性表明在基于强化学习的后训练和图像编辑模型的测试时扩展等高级应用中具有潜力。模型和训练数据集将开源以帮助社区构建更多高质量图像编辑训练数据集。

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

*Xiangrui Liu,Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Zhengyang Liang,Yang Tian,Chen Jason Zhang,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Task-oriented Temporal Grounding (ToTG)新问题，旨在基于任务描述定位长视频中的关键时间区间，并开发了TimeScope框架通过渐进式推理解决该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别长视频中的关键时刻对于下游理解和推理任务至关重要，但传统方法泛化能力有限且难以处理长视频。

Method: TimeScope框架采用渐进式推理：首先在长视频中识别粗粒度的可能包含关键时刻的时间范围，然后通过细粒度时刻划分来精炼该范围。

Result: 大量实验表明，TimeScope在各种设置下均优于现有的时间定位方法和流行的MLLMs。

Conclusion: TimeScope能有效解决这一新的挑战性问题，在ToTG任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR是首个专为基于下一个token预测的自回归图像生成设计的测试时缩放框架，无需早期解码或辅助奖励，通过token熵和两级缩放机制提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法依赖频繁的部分解码和外部奖励模型，不适用于基于下一个token预测的自回归图像生成，因为中间解码结果不完整。

Method: 提出ScalingAR框架，利用token熵作为视觉token生成的新信号，在配置文件级别融合内在和条件信号校准置信状态，在策略级别自适应终止低置信轨迹并动态调度指导。

Result: 在通用和组合基准测试中，ScalingAR将基础模型性能提升12.5%（GenEval）和15.2%（TIIF-Bench），视觉token消耗减少62.0%，在挑战性场景中缓解性能下降26.0%。

Conclusion: ScalingAR成功将测试时缩放应用于自回归图像生成，显著提升生成质量、效率和鲁棒性，无需外部奖励或早期解码。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出PANDA，一种基于MLLM的智能AI工程师，用于视频异常检测，无需训练数据或人工干预即可处理任何场景和异常类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频异常检测方法依赖特定领域训练数据和人工调整，在新场景和未见异常类型上泛化能力有限且成本高，因此需要实现通用的异常检测。

Method: 开发了四种关键能力：自适应场景感知策略规划、目标驱动启发式推理、工具增强自反思、自我改进记忆链。具体包括自适应场景感知RAG机制、潜在异常引导启发提示策略、渐进式反思机制和记忆链机制。

Result: 大量实验表明，PANDA在多场景、开放集和复杂场景设置中无需训练和人工参与即可实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PANDA验证了其可泛化和鲁棒的异常检测能力，为通用视频异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像到视频生成在运动真实性方面仍面临挑战，难以准确建模复杂的物理约束、物体交互和领域特定动态。

Method: 提出MotionRAG框架，包括：基于检索的流程提取高级运动特征；上下文学习方法进行运动适应；基于注意力的运动注入适配器将运动特征集成到预训练视频扩散模型中。

Result: 在多个领域和各种基础模型上均取得显著改进，推理时计算开销可忽略，模块化设计支持通过更新检索数据库实现新领域的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: 该研究通过有效检索和迁移运动先验，增强了视频生成系统的核心能力，促进了真实运动动态的合成。

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率模型评估使用平均分数，无法反映模型在不同难度图像上的性能差异，特别是某些模型在困难图像上会产生伪影但平均分数相近的问题。

Method: 提出了两种图像难度度量：高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数，用于预测测试图像中模型视觉结果的显著差异，并开发了相应的评估方法。

Result: 实验结果表明所提出的图像难度度量和评估方法能够有效区分视觉结果不同但平均性能接近的SISR模型。

Conclusion: 提出的难度感知性能评估程序能够更好地反映超分辨率模型在视觉质量上的真实差异，为模型评估提供了更准确的方法。

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

TL;DR: PRISM是一个渐进式三阶段图像去雨框架，通过粗提取、频域融合和精细恢复网络，结合混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba模型，有效去除雨纹并保持图像细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单尺度去雨模型在细粒度恢复和全局一致性方面存在不足，需要一种能同时处理高频雨纹特征和保持结构细节的方法。

Method: 提出三阶段渐进框架：CENet进行粗提取，SFNet使用HA-UNet进行多尺度特征聚合，结合HDMamba联合建模空间语义和小波域特征，RNet通过原始分辨率子网络恢复细粒度结构。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了与近期去雨方法相竞争的结果，能够有效学习高频雨纹特征同时保持结构细节和全局上下文。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过渐进式多阶段处理和混合域建模，在图像去雨任务中实现了更好的图像质量，解决了单尺度模型的局限性。

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了QuaRTZ方法，通过残差截断和零抑制实现扩散模型的4位量化，在保持纹理细节的同时显著降低计算需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成质量高但计算需求大，现有8位量化效果良好但扩展到4位仍具挑战性，小幅度激活对纹理保真度至关重要

Method: QuaRTZ采用8位最小-最大量化处理异常值，通过前导零抑制压缩到4位以保留最低有效位，平衡异常值保留和LSB精度

Result: 在FLUX.1-schnell上实现FID 6.98，优于需要辅助FP16分支的SVDQuant方法

Conclusion: QuaRTZ通过理论推导和实证评估证明了其在不同激活分布上的通用性，成功实现了扩散模型的高效4位量化

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos是一个单向前向的3D高斯框架，用于3D风格迁移，无需姿态估计或逐场景优化，能够从单张图像或多视图集合生成风格化的3D高斯场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D风格迁移方法需要预计算姿态或逐场景优化的限制，实现无需姿态、可泛化到未见类别、场景和风格的几何感知、视图一致的风格化。

Method: 采用Transformer骨干网络，包含两条路径：几何预测路径使用自注意力保持几何保真度，风格注入路径通过全局交叉注意力确保视图间视觉一致性，并引入基于体素的3D风格损失来对齐场景特征与风格统计信息。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Stylos能够实现高质量的零样本风格化，证明了全局风格-内容耦合、提出的3D风格损失以及从单视图到大规模多视图设置的可扩展性的有效性。

Conclusion: Stylos通过创新的架构设计和损失函数，实现了无需姿态估计的高质量3D风格迁移，在保持几何保真度的同时确保视图一致性，具有良好的泛化能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

Motivation: 室内场景分类在计算机视觉中至关重要，特别是在敏感内容分析如儿童性虐待图像分类方面。传统方法面临物体间复杂关系和空间布局的挑战。

Method: 将图像转换为场景图，然后使用图注意力网络进行推理，直接建模场景组件间的交互关系。

Result: 在Places8数据集上达到81.27%的平衡准确率，优于基于图像的方法；在实际儿童性虐待图像评估中获得74.27%的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 结构化场景表示是室内场景分类和敏感内容分析的稳健范式，具有可解释性和隐私保护优势。

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从用户移动轨迹重建空间布局（如家庭平面图）的方法，使用基于扩散的后验采样器，并通过对比学习在嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数来解决传统方法的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从移动轨迹直接重建空间布局是一个不适定问题，因为多个平面图可以解释相同的轨迹。传统生成式逆求解器中的前向算子（路径规划过程）不可逆且不可微，导致似然分数优化不稳定。

Method: 采用扩散模型进行后验采样，通过在嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数来解决不稳定性问题。使用对比损失训练嵌入空间，使兼容的平面图和轨迹靠近，不匹配的对远离。

Result: 提出的CoGuide模型在广泛实验中产生了更一致的平面图，比可微分规划器基线和引导扩散方法更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 在嵌入空间中定义的替代似然分数是真实似然分数的有效近似，能够引导去噪过程趋向后验分布，解决了传统方法的不稳定性问题。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

Motivation: 大型语言模型计算成本高，不适合资源受限的边缘环境，而预训练后的小模型在复杂任务上性能不足，需要高效的后训练方法来提升性能。

Method: 采用课程式监督微调(SFT)和离线策略知识蒸馏的系统化后训练流程。

Result: 生成的指令调优模型在十亿参数模型中达到最先进性能，在严格硬件约束下表现出强泛化能力，并在多种任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 为昇腾边缘设备开发高性能语言模型提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

Motivation: 现有深度增强方法假设理想dToF输入和完美dToF-RGB对齐，忽略了实际应用中的校准误差和异常，限制了真实世界的适用性。

Method: 1）基于合成数据集的模拟方法生成真实训练样本；2）无学习参数异常检测机制识别错误dToF测量；3）针对噪声dToF输入的深度补全网络，整合RGB图像和单目深度估计先验。

Result: 在ZJU-L5数据集上RMSE和Rel分别提升22%和11%；在Mirror3D-NYU数据集上镜面区域性能提升37%；在Hammer数据集上超越L515测量22%。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升深度感知性能，使低成本传感器超越高端设备，具有很好的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型和基准测试未能捕捉专业视频生成的复杂性和需求，需要建立面向专业电影制作的结构化评估框架。

Method: 构建了包含76个控制节点的四个分类法，开发了自动化的提示分类和问题生成流程，进行了大规模人类研究（10+模型、20K视频、80+电影专业人士标注）。

Result: 当前最强模型在Events和Camera相关控制方面存在显著差距，训练出的自动评估器优于现有零样本基线方法。

Conclusion: SCINE首次将专业视频生成置于视频生成模型的研究视野中，通过以电影控制为中心的分类法和结构化评估流程为未来研究提供指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够有效自动化连接组学中的校对任务，显著降低人工成本并提高重建效率

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

TL;DR: DiffCamera是一个基于扩散变换器的图像重聚焦模型，能够根据任意新的焦点和模糊级别灵活调整已创建图像的景深效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统摄影中景深效果一旦创建就难以修改的问题，特别是当拍摄主体失焦时无法调整的局限性。

Method: 设计扩散变换器框架进行重聚焦学习，使用模拟数据生成大规模图像对，并引入基于摄影原理的堆叠约束来增强训练效果。

Result: 模型能够在各种场景下实现稳定的重聚焦，为摄影和生成式AI应用提供前所未有的景深控制能力。

Conclusion: DiffCamera通过物理约束的扩散变换器框架，成功实现了灵活且准确的图像景深重聚焦，解决了传统摄影的局限性。

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

Motivation: 现有多模态音频生成模型缺乏精确的用户控制能力，无法在专业Foley工作流程中优先处理特定对象或避免不必要的背景声音，限制了实际应用。

Method: 引入视频对象分割感知音频生成任务，提出SAGANet模型，利用视觉分割掩码、视频和文本线索进行可控音频生成，并创建Segmented Music Solos基准数据集。

Result: 相比现有最先进方法有显著改进，为可控、高保真Foley合成设立了新标准。

Conclusion: SAGANet通过对象级分割实现了细粒度的音频控制，为专业Foley工作流程提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

Conclusion: DA²方法在准确性、零样本泛化能力和效率方面均表现优异，解决了全景深度估计的关键挑战。

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么优化参数化模板而忽略宽松衣物和人物交互，要么在简化相机假设下训练隐式函数，限制了实际场景应用。HART旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 预测逐像素3D点图、法线和身体对应关系，采用遮挡感知的泊松重建恢复完整几何，与SMPL-X身体模型对齐，并用人体对齐网格初始化高斯泼溅进行稀疏视角渲染。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得显著改进：着装网格重建的Chamfer距离提升18-23%，SMPL-X估计的PA-V2V降低6-27%，新视角合成的LPIPS减少15-27%。

Conclusion: 前馈变换器可作为在真实世界环境中进行鲁棒人体重建的可扩展模型。

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了首个SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，通过架构设计实现姿态和尺度不变性，在去偏评估协议下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D形状补全方法依赖预对齐到规范坐标系，这会导致网络利用姿态和尺度线索而非推断内在几何结构，在真实未对齐数据上性能崩溃。

Method: 设计SIM(3)-等变网络架构，包含逐步规范化特征、在相似性不变几何空间推理、恢复原始坐标系的模块化层。

Result: 在PCN基准测试的去偏评估中优于等变和增强基线方法；在KITTI上最小匹配距离降低17%，在OmniObject3D上Chamfer距离降低14%。

Conclusion: 完全SIM(3)等变性是实现真正可泛化形状补全的有效途径，即使在更严格的评估协议下仍优于其他方法的偏置设置。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

TL;DR: 提出了Query-Kontext方法，通过多模态"kontext"连接VLM和扩散模型，将多模态生成推理能力委托给VLM，同时保留扩散模型的高质量视觉合成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型中，多模态生成推理能力与高保真合成能力内在纠缠，需要解耦这两种能力以实现更好的性能。

Method: 使用多模态kontext（语义线索和粗粒度图像条件）连接VLM和扩散模型，采用三阶段渐进训练策略：连接VLM与轻量扩散头、扩展到预训练扩散模型、引入低级图像编码器进行指令调优。

Result: 实验表明该方法与强大的统一基线相当，在某些情况下甚至优于任务特定的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Query-Kontext成功解耦了多模态生成推理和视觉合成，为统一多模态模型提供了更有效的架构设计。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

TL;DR: Stitch是一种无需训练的方法，通过自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制集成到多模态扩散变换器中，解决了文本到图像生成中空间关系准确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在准确捕捉空间关系（如"上方"或"右侧"）方面存在困难，而早期方法由于架构演进已与现代模型不兼容。

Method: 通过自动生成边界框，在指定边界框内生成单个对象，然后无缝拼接在一起；利用特定的注意力头在生成过程中隔离和裁剪单个对象。

Result: 在PosEval基准测试中，Stitch显著提升了基础模型性能，将FLUX在GenEval位置任务上提升了218%，在PosEval上提升了206%；在Qwen-Image上实现了最先进的结果，比先前模型提升了54%。

Conclusion: Stitch成功地将位置控制集成到领先模型中，无需训练即可实现空间准确且视觉吸引人的图像生成，证明了在基于位置的生成方面仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is
available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/Stitch.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTT3R是一种无需训练的3D重建方法，通过测试时训练视角改进循环神经网络在超出训练长度时的泛化能力，在20 FPS下实现2倍位姿估计精度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代循环神经网络在3D重建中表现出色，但在超出训练上下文长度时性能显著下降，存在长度泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: 从测试时训练视角重新审视3D重建基础模型，将其设计为在线学习问题，利用记忆状态与观测之间的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率来平衡历史信息保留与新观测适应。

Result: TTT3R显著改善了长度泛化能力，在全局位姿估计上比基线方法提升2倍，仅需6GB GPU内存即可在20 FPS下处理数千张图像。

Conclusion: 测试时训练视角为3D重建中的长度泛化问题提供了有效解决方案，TTT3R方法在不需额外训练的情况下显著提升了循环神经网络的性能。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in
