### [1] [Recurrence Meets Transformers for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08897)
*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReT-2是一个统一的多模态检索模型，支持图像和文本组成的多模态查询，并能在多模态文档集合中进行检索，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>

Conclusion: ReT-2是一个高效统一的多模态检索模型，支持复杂的多模态查询和检索任务，在性能和效率方面都优于现有方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

### [2] [Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908)
*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用视觉扩散模型特征和transformer聚合，实现跨物种、视角和上下文的人类级动作识别泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够识别不同物种、视角和上下文中的相同动作，但当前深度学习模型在此类泛化方面存在困难

Method: 利用视觉扩散模型生成特征，通过transformer进行聚合，特别使用扩散过程早期时间步的条件模型来突出语义信息而非像素细节

Result: 在跨物种、跨视角和跨上下文三个泛化基准测试中都达到了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 该方法使机器动作识别更接近人类级别的鲁棒性，为跨域动作识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

### [3] [PromptGuard: An Orchestrated Prompting Framework for Principled Synthetic Text Generation for Vulnerable Populations using LLMs with Enhanced Safety, Fairness, and Controllability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08910)
*Tung Vu,Lam Nguyen,Quynh Dao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个模块化提示框架，通过VulnGuard Prompt技术使用对比学习防止LLM生成有害信息，特别保护LGBTQ+、单亲家庭等弱势群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法依赖事后过滤或通用对齐技术，无法在生成源头主动防止有害输出，对弱势群体造成风险。

Method: 提出PromptGuard框架，包含VulnGuard Prompt混合技术，整合few-shot示例、伦理思维链推理和自适应角色提示，采用多目标优化理论。

Result: 通过熵边界和帕累托最优性证明25-30%的分析性伤害减少，建立基于GitHub数据集的理论验证框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为系统性实证研究奠定数学基础，提供实时伤害预防的智能专家系统。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

### [4] [Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926)
*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Beta-SOD方法，通过Beta混合分布建模相似度分布来检测标签噪声，在行人重识别和车辆重识别任务中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标重识别方法对标签噪声高度敏感，传统方法在噪声环境下性能显著下降，需要开发鲁棒的噪声处理框架

Method: 采用孪生网络架构，结合二元交叉熵、对比损失和余弦嵌入损失，提出基于Beta混合分布的统计异常检测框架Beta-SOD来建模嵌入对之间的余弦相似度分布

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，在10-30%噪声水平下均优于现有最先进方法，展示了鲁棒性和广泛适用性

Conclusion: Beta-SOD通过统计建模相似度分布有效处理重识别中的标签噪声问题，为噪声环境下的重识别任务提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

### [5] [SFD-Mamba2Net: Strcture-Guided Frequency-Enhanced Dual-Stream Mamba2 Network for Coronary Artery Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08934)
*Nan Mu,Ruiqi Song,Zhihui Xu,Jingfeng Jiang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFD-Mamba2Net是一个用于冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的端到端框架，通过多尺度结构先验、状态空间长程依赖建模和频域细节增强策略，显著提高了ICA图像的分割和检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病是全球主要死因之一，ICA作为诊断金标准需要精确的血管分割和狭窄检测。但ICA图像具有低对比度、高噪声和复杂细粒度血管结构的特点，现有方法面临重大挑战。

Method: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net框架：编码器嵌入曲率感知结构增强模块(CASE)突出管状血管结构；解码器引入渐进高频感知模块(PHFP)通过多级小波分解细化高频细节并整合低频全局结构。

Result: 在八个分割指标上持续优于最先进方法，在狭窄检测中实现了最高的真阳性率和阳性预测值。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合多尺度结构先验、长程依赖建模和频域增强策略，显著提升了ICA图像中冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的准确性。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

### [6] [Live(r) Die: Predicting Survival in Colorectal Liver Metastasis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08935)
*Muhammad Alberb,Helen Cheung,Anne Martel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于前后对比MRI的全自动化桌肮肝转移外科预得框架，包含自动分割流水线和形态学生存分析，预测效果超过临床生物标记10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 桌肮肝转移病人预后差异大，现有预测模型预测能力不足，特别是多发性肝转移情况下

Method: 使用SAMONAI算法完善部分标注数据，建立自动分割流水线，继而用SurvAMINN网络进行形态学特征提取和生存分析

Result: 在227名患者数据集上，该框架预测效果显著超过现有临床和基因组生物标记，C指数提升10%

Conclusion: 自动分割算法与形态学生存分析的集成能够提供准确、高效且可解释性的桌肮肝转移外科预得方案

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

### [7] [Discovering Divergent Representations between Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08940)
*Lisa Dunlap,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Trevor Darrell,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompCon算法用于比较不同文本到图像生成模型的视觉表示差异，通过进化搜索发现模型间不同的视觉属性和触发这些差异的提示词


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同生成模型学习到的视觉表示在何时以及如何出现分歧，发现一个模型生成而另一个模型不生成的视觉属性及其触发条件

Method: 提出CompCon进化搜索算法，自动发现模型输出中更普遍的视觉属性差异，并建立自动化数据生成管道创建ID2数据集进行验证

Result: 成功比较了流行文本到图像模型，发现如PixArt在孤独提示下生成湿街道，Stable Diffusion 3.5在媒体职业提示下描绘非裔美国人的差异

Conclusion: CompCon能有效发现生成模型间的视觉表示差异，为理解模型偏差和特征学习提供了新工具

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Conclusion: 该方法为解决无人机遥感图像中的云影和太阳耀斑问题提供了有效的解决方案，有助于提高水质监测等应用的准确性。

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

### [9] [CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959)
*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin是一种新颖的特征融合架构，通过在注意力块中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，将分层移位窗口注意力与局部卷积特征学习相结合，解决了ViT在小数据集上局部特征提取不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在计算机视觉中取得了显著成果，但其对全局上下文的强调往往以牺牲小数据集中的局部特征提取为代价，特别是缺乏局部性和平移等变性等关键归纳偏置。

Method: 提出CoSwin架构，在分层移位窗口注意力基础上增加局部卷积特征学习，每个注意力块中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构。

Result: 在多个图像分类基准测试中表现优于最先进的卷积和基于transformer的模型，在CIFAR-10上提升2.17%，CIFAR-100上提升4.92%，MNIST上提升0.10%，SVHN上提升0.26%，Tiny ImageNet上提升4.47%。

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合有效增强了transformer在小规模视觉任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

### [10] [iMatcher: Improve matching in point cloud registration via local-to-global geometric consistency learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08982)
*Karim Slimani,Catherine Achard,Brahim Tamadazte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher是一个完全可微的点云配准特征匹配框架，通过局部图嵌入和全局几何一致性学习实现高精度匹配


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决点云配准中特征匹配的几何一致性问题，结合局部和全局信息提高匹配精度

Method: 使用局部图嵌入模块初始化得分矩阵，通过双向最近邻搜索进行重定位，最后通过全局几何一致性学习预测匹配概率

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最先进性能：KITTI 95%-97%，KITTI-360 94%-97%，3DMatch 81.1%

Conclusion: iMatcher通过完全可微的框架显著提升了点云配准性能，在不同场景下都表现出优异的鲁棒性

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UltrON方法，利用超声B模式图像的声学特征进行弱监督优化，改进3D形状重建，解决遮挡和标注依赖问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超声3D重建依赖精确标注且忽略B模式图像的丰富声学信息，同时难以处理超声视角依赖性和声影伪影问题

Method: 采用基于占位的表示方法，提出UltrON框架利用声学特征改进几何一致性，设计新损失函数补偿视角依赖性，支持多视角超声优化

Result: UltrON能够缓解遮挡和稀疏标注的限制，提高重建准确性，并可推广到相同解剖结构的不同形状

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确的3D重建开辟了新途径，无需额外标注成本即可从B模式图像获取声学特征

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at
https://github.com/magdalena-wysocki/ultron.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动量化心脏标记MRI中的心肌运动和应变仍然是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，需要准确且可扩展的解决方案

Method: 使用基于学习潜在码的隐式神经表示(INRs)来预测连续左心室位移，无需推理时优化

Result: 在452个UK Biobank测试案例中，实现了最佳跟踪精度(2.14 mm RMSE)和最低的全局周向应变(2.86%)与径向应变(6.42%)组合误差，比最准确基线快约380倍

Conclusion: 基于INR的模型适用于大型CMR数据集中心肌应变的准确和可扩展分析

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

### [13] [E-MLNet: Enhanced Mutual Learning for Universal Domain Adaptation with Sample-Specific Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09006)
*Samuel Felipe dos Santos,Tiago Agostinho de Almeida,Jurandy Almeida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了增强型互学习网络(E-MLNet)，通过动态加权策略改进通用域自适应，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用域自适应方法如MLNet对所有分类器平等对待，导致学习信号稀释，需要更精细的边界区分策略

Method: E-MLNet集成动态加权策略到开集熵最小化中，利用闭集分类器预测，针对每个目标样本聚焦最相关的类别边界

Result: 在四个基准测试中取得最高平均H分数，在31个任务中22个开放部分域自适应和19个开放集域自适应任务中优于MLNet基线

Conclusion: 动态加权策略有效提升了已知和未知类别的区分能力，证明了聚焦适应策略的优势

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu填补了乌尔都语多模态研究的空白，通过发布数据集和质量评估流程，有助于减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，为包容性视觉-语言系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Motivation: 解决现有fMRI视觉解码方法依赖特定主体训练的问题，提高可扩展性和实际部署能力

Method: 结合Token Merging Transformer进行高效体素压缩，使用查询驱动的Q-Former生成与CLIP图像嵌入空间对齐的固定大小神经表示

Result: 在7T自然场景数据集上，VoxelFormer在训练包含的主体上实现了有竞争力的检索性能，且参数量显著少于现有方法

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes
Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects
included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

TL;DR: PCGM是一种新的3D脑MRI反事实生成方法，通过概率图模型整合解剖约束，使用ControlNet和扩散模型生成高质量脑部图像，能够保留细微的解剖变化并复制疾病对大脑皮层的微妙影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D脑MRI研究需要检测队列间细微的形态差异，但现有反事实模型缺乏明确的归纳偏置来保持精细解剖细节，无法生成解剖学上合理的MRI图像。

Method: 提出概率因果图模型(PCGM)，通过概率图模块捕获解剖约束并转换为空间二进制掩码，使用3D ControlNet编码掩码约束新的反事实去噪UNet，最后通过3D扩散解码器生成高质量脑MRI。

Result: 在多数据集上的实验表明PCGM生成的结构性脑MRI质量优于多个基线方法，首次证明从反事实图像中提取的脑测量能够复制神经科学文献中报道的疾病对皮层区域的微妙影响。

Conclusion: PCGM在合成MRI用于研究细微形态差异方面取得了重要里程碑，为医学影像分析提供了高质量的图像合成解决方案。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated
content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D
medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,
potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets,

Conclusion: 多任务学习结合交互区域信息能够有效提升人与固定物体交互识别的性能，为现实环境中的人物交互检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

Motivation: 当前多光谱目标检测方法在特征融合时常常保留多余的背景或噪声，限制了感知性能

Method: 提出互特征精炼模块(MFRM)和差分特征反馈模块(DFFM)，形成迭代关系图差分引导特征融合机制(IRDFusion)，通过迭代反馈放大显著关系信号并抑制特征噪声

Result: 在FLIR、LLVIP和M³FD数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在各种挑战性场景中始终优于现有方法

Conclusion: IRDFusion框架通过创新的特征融合机制有效提升了多光谱目标检测的性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Motivation: 现有VLA模型计算和内存成本过高，现有压缩方法无法同时实现量化和token剪枝的协同优化，存在不兼容问题

Method: 提出新的量化感知token剪枝标准，在激进量化模型上工作，同时改进量化器设计以增强剪枝效果

Result: 在标准VLA模型上实现计算效率和推理速度显著提升，达到1.93倍加速和最高4.5%平均成功率提升

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA成功解决了量化和token剪枝的不兼容问题，为VLA模型的实用部署提供了有效的加速方案

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc成功实现了无需地面真值姿态的自监督LiDAR全局定位，在多个任务上表现优异，且具有更好的可扩展性，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Motivation: 现有基础分割模型能够零样本提取叶片实例，但分割包含多个重叠叶片的完整植物个体仍然困难，这需要物种特定的标注数据集和大量人工劳动。

Method: 整合基础分割模型（提取叶片实例）和视觉语言模型（推理植物结构），无需额外训练即可提取植物个体。

Result: 在多物种、多生长阶段和多拍摄环境的数据集评估中，该方法超越了现有零样本方法，并在跨域性能上优于监督方法。

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg提供了一种有效的零样本解决方案，能够准确分割植物个体，减少对标注数据的依赖，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

Motivation: CLIP在行人表征学习中面临两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模标注的行人中心视觉语言数据，以及全局对比学习难以保持细粒度匹配所需的判别性局部特征且易受噪声文本标记影响。

Method: 1) 开发基于MLLM上下文学习能力的噪声抵抗数据构建管道，自动过滤和标注网络图像，构建包含500万高质量行人中心图像-文本对的WebPerson数据集；2) 提出GA-DMS框架，通过梯度注意力相似性评分自适应掩码噪声文本标记，并引入掩码标记预测目标来增强细粒度语义表征学习。

Conclusion: 通过数据构建和模型架构的协同改进，GA-DMS框架有效解决了CLIP在行人表征学习中的挑战，显著提升了跨模态对齐和细粒度语义表示能力。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 构建大规模PET成像基础模型面临标注数据有限和计算资源不足的挑战，需要克服数据稀缺和效率限制的问题。

Method: 采用潜在扩散模型(LDM)，包含三项关键技术：1) Radon掩码增强策略(RMAS)生成20多万个结构多样的训练样本；2) 正负掩码约束嵌入几何一致性；3) 透明医学注意力(TMA)机制增强病灶相关区域。

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺和计算效率问题，为低资源环境下的医学影像分析提供了有效的解决方案，具有很好的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

Motivation: 比较持续同调(PH)和人工神经网络(ANN)在从噪声数据中推断拓扑结构的性能，探索ANN在拓扑分析中的潜力。

Method: 使用监督神经网络预测2D二值图像的贝蒂数，并与基于立方复形和符号欧几里得距离变换(SEDT)的PH流程进行对比。在一个合成数据集和两个真实数据集上进行实验。

Result: ANN在噪声条件下表现优于PH方法，这归因于ANN能够从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验信息。

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于发展初期，但ANN为结构噪声下的拓扑估计提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案，展示了在噪声鲁棒性方面的优势。

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标主要关注整体图像质量，与人类感知存在差异。受神经心理学启发，作者认为人类识别3D场景时主要关注单个对象

Method: 利用对象检测模型及其特征表示来量化场景中每个对象的"对象性"，进行以对象为中心的评估

Result: 用户研究表明OSIM比现有指标更符合人类感知，并对近期3D重建和生成模型进行了标准化重新评估

Conclusion: OSIM提供了一个更符合人类感知的3D场景评估框架，有助于更清晰地理解该领域的进展

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

*Lei Wang,Piotr Koniusz,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本调查首次采用数据集驱动的视角，分析视频理解领域的发展，展示数据集特征如何引导模型架构演进，并为通用视频理解提供实用指南和路线图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调查主要按任务或模型家族分类，忽视了数据集通过结构性压力引导架构演进的重要作用。本文旨在填补这一空白，从数据集驱动的角度重新解读视频理解发展历程。

Method: 采用数据集驱动视角，分析运动复杂性、时间跨度、层次组合和多模态丰富性等数据集特征如何为模型施加归纳偏置，并重新解读从双流网络、3D CNN到序列模型、Transformer和多模态基础模型等里程碑架构。

Result: 建立了数据集、归纳偏置和架构的统一框架，将关键里程碑模型重新解释为对数据集驱动压力的具体响应，提供了模型设计与数据集不变性对齐的实用指导。

Conclusion: 通过将数据集、归纳偏置和架构统一到一个连贯的框架中，本调查既提供了全面的回顾性分析，也为推进通用视频理解提供了规范性的路线图，强调了在可扩展性和任务需求之间平衡的重要性。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

TL;DR: OCELOT 2023挑战赛通过提供多尺度重叠细胞和组织标注数据集，验证了细胞-组织相互作用理解对提升细胞检测性能的重要性，最佳模型相比仅细胞检测基线F1分数提升了7.99。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学家在检查全玻片图像时会在不同放大倍数间切换以评估组织形态和细胞细节，但现有深度学习模型难以学习不同尺度结构间的相互依赖语义，且缺乏多尺度重叠标注数据集。

Method: OCELOT 2023挑战赛收集了来自306个TCGA全玻片图像的673对重叠细胞检测和组织分割标注，涵盖六个器官，分为训练、验证和测试集，参与者开发了理解细胞-组织关系的模型。

Result: 参赛模型显著增强了对细胞-组织关系的理解，最佳模型在测试集上相比不包含细胞-组织关系的基线细胞检测模型F1分数提升了7.99，性能大幅超越传统仅细胞检测方法。

Conclusion: 研究证明了将多尺度语义纳入模型的必要性，细胞-组织相互作用的理解对于实现人类水平性能至关重要，OCELOT挑战加速了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

TL;DR: RT-DETR++改进了RT-DETR模型的编码器，通过通道门控注意力上采样/下采样机制和CSP-PAC特征融合技术，在无人机图像小目标检测中实现了优异性能，同时保持实时检测速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机图像中的目标检测面临小目标密集、尺度变化大、遮挡严重等挑战，需要改进现有模型来提升检测性能。

Method: 1. 引入通道门控注意力上采样/下采样(AU/AD)机制的双路径系统；2. 在特征融合中采用CSP-PAC技术，使用并行空洞卷积处理局部和上下文信息。

Result: 新设计的neck结构在小目标和密集目标检测方面表现出优越性能，模型保持实时检测速度且不增加计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 本研究为实时检测系统中的特征编码设计提供了有效方法，解决了无人机图像目标检测的关键挑战。

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

### [31] [A Knowledge Noise Mitigation Framework for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09159)
*Zhiyue Liu,Sihang Liu,Jinyuan Liu,Xinru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无需训练的知识聚焦框架，通过提取核心查询、知识精简和选择性整合策略，有效减少知识冗余和噪声，在KB-VQA任务上达到了独创性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识基硅视觉问答方法存在大量知识冗余问题，直接整合查找的知识会引入噪声，影响回答准确性。

Method: 首先从图像-问题对中提取核心查询，提高知识相关性；然后使用大模型识别和提取有益回答的知识段落；最后采用选择性整合策略，仅在模型缺乏信心时才使用知识。

Result: 广泛实验证明，该框架能够获得准确关键的知识，在KB-VQA任务上超过了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过知识聚焦框架，有效减少了知识冗余和噪声影响，提高了知识基硅视觉问答的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CWSSNet分类框架，融合3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，解决高光谱图像特征冗余问题，在江西余干县地物分类中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像虽然光谱信息丰富，但存在波段多、维度高、光谱混合等特征冗余问题，需要更精细的地物分类方法。

Method: 使用ZY1F卫星高光谱数据，提出CWSSNet框架，整合3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，采用多尺度卷积注意力模块融合多模态信息，引入小波域多波段分解和卷积操作。

Result: 在余干县取得mIoU 74.50%、mAcc 82.73%、mF1 84.94%的优异性能，在水体、植被和裸地分类中IoU最高，小样本训练下性能稳定。

Conclusion: CWSSNet框架有效解决了高光谱图像特征冗余问题，提升了地物分类精度，具有良好的鲁棒性和小样本适应能力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image
synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility.
Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated
images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection
methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on
human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.

### [34] [Dark-ISP: Enhancing RAW Image Processing for Low-Light Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09183)
*Jiasheng Guo,Xin Gao,Yuxiang Yan,Guanghao Li,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级自适应性Dark-ISP插件，直接处理RAW图像来改善低光环境下的物体检测性能。通过将传统ISP流程解构为可微分模块并使用任务驱动的自适应机制，该方法在三个RAW数据集上都超越了现有的RGB和RAW基于的检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光环境下的物体检测面临图像质量降级的挑战。虽然RAW图像比RGB图像具有更好的潜力，但现有方法或者使用有信息损失的RAW-RGB图像，或者采用复杂的框架。需要一种轻量级且自适应的方案来直接处理RAW图像。

Method: 提出Dark-ISP轻量级ISP插件，将传统ISP流程解构为线性传感器校准和非线性音调映射两个子模块。每个模块都是可微分的，通过任务驱动损失进行优化，具备内容感知自适应性和物理知识预设。还设计了自成增机制，促进子模块间的协作。

Result: 在三个RAW图像数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，该方法在具有最少参数的情况下，在具有挑战性的低光环境中超越了现有的RGB和RAW基于的检测方法，达到了更优秀的结果。

Conclusion: Dark-ISP提供了一种轻量级且自适应的方案，能够直接处理Bayer RAW图像，支持无缝的端到端训练。通过将ISP流程重构为可微分模块并使用任务驱动的自适应机制，该方法在低光物体检测任务中表现出艰阵性能。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGTraj是一个多粒度目标引导的人类轨迹预测模型，通过从粗到细的递归编码和Transformer精炼网络，在多个粒度级别整合特征，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标引导方法在粗粒度目标预测和细粒度轨迹补全之间存在粒度鸿沟，中间时间粒度的效用未被充分探索，多粒度建模能更好捕捉人类动态和运动模式。

Method: 提出MGTraj模型，递归编码从粗到细的轨迹提议，每级使用Transformer递归精炼网络捕获特征并预测渐进精炼，采用权重共享策略整合多粒度特征，并使用速度预测作为辅助任务。

Conclusion: 多粒度目标引导框架能有效提升人类轨迹预测精度，递归精炼和特征整合策略是成功的关键。

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

TL;DR: Medverse是一个通用的3D医学影像上下文学习模型，通过多尺度自回归框架和块状交叉注意力模块，在22个数据集上训练，实现了跨任务、器官和模态的高保真预测和全局解剖理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学影像的上下文学习模型无法同时实现高保真预测和全局解剖理解，且缺乏跨任务和区域的统一模型，限制了上下文学习在医学影像中的潜力。

Method: 采用多尺度自回归上下文学习框架，从粗到细逐步细化预测，生成全分辨率体积输出；提出块状交叉注意力模块，在保持计算效率的同时促进上下文与目标输入的长程交互。

Result: 在涵盖未见临床中心、器官、物种和成像模态的广泛数据集上评估，Medverse显著优于现有基线方法，建立了上下文学习的新范式。

Conclusion: Medverse展示了在3D医学影像中实现通用上下文学习的可行性，为医学图像分析提供了强大的统一解决方案，代码和模型权重将公开。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available
at https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse.

Conclusion: CoAtNeXt是胃组织图像病理分类的鲁棒架构，在二分类和多分类任务上表现优异，有潜力辅助病理学家提高诊断准确性并减少工作负担

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在牙科等专业医学领域的有效性尚未充分探索，特别是全景X射线影像由于密集解剖结构和细微病理线索带来的解释挑战

Method: 构建包含20,563张标注图像和130万条指令实例的MMOral数据集，涵盖属性提取、报告生成、视觉问答和图像对话等任务类型；基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B进行监督微调开发OralGPT模型

Conclusion: MMOral数据集和OralGPT模型为智能牙科发展提供了重要基础，有望推动牙科领域更具临床影响力的多模态AI系统发展

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

TL;DR: 通过时间戳注入机制和语义引导的时间相似性采样策略，提升多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中的绝对时间理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用均匀帧采样和隐式位置编码，导致长距离依赖性问题、关键信息丢失和时间理解能力下降

Method: 时间戳注入机制(TIM)将视频帧嵌入与文本时间戳交织构造连续时间参考系统，时间意识相似性采样(TASS)通过两阶段算法确保语义相关性和时间覆盖

Result: 在小时级长视频测试集上获得显著改进，绝对时间理解和关键事件定位能力达到最高水平，7B模型甚至超迈许多72B模型

Conclusion: DATE方法通过显式时间建模和语义引导的采样策略，有效解决了长视频理解中的时间理解挑战，为多模态大模型的长视频处理提供了有效方案

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

TL;DR: PSP-Seg是一个渐进式剪枝框架，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失实现动态高效的3D医学图像分割，在保持性能的同时大幅降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D医学图像分割资源消耗大、时间长的限制，以及现有静态模型难以平衡性能和效率的问题。

Method: 从冗余模型开始，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失迭代剪枝冗余模块。

Result: 轻量版PSP-Seg-S性能与nnU-Net相当，GPU内存使用减少42-45%，训练时间减少29-48%，参数量减少83-87%。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg是成本效益高且性能优异的替代方案，具有广泛的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

TL;DR: 本文提出Code-as-Thought(CaT)方法，通过学习视觉可编程性来动态选择代码路径或直接视觉推理路径，以解决图表理解任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解方法存在问题：外部工具依赖性强且某些图表不适合符号表示，而单一的文本推理策略中间步骤难以验证。

Method: 提出视觉可编程性概念，构建了一个适应性框架，让VLM学习在CaT代码路径和直接视觉推理路径之间选择。使用双重奖励系统进行强化学习训练。

Result: 在多样化的图表理解测试集上表现出艰固的性能，显示了强大的适应能力。

Conclusion: 证明VLMs不仅可以学习如何推理，还可以学习动态选择最优的推理路径，为涉及视觉信息的复杂推理任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态脑MRI分割模型要么局限于固定模态，要么在泛化到新模态时丢失模态特异性信息。需要开发一个能处理任意可用成像模态的通用模型。

Method: 在U-net架构中集成模态无关输入通道和模态特定输入通道，通过合成人工MRI模态的图像增强方案训练模态无关组件。

Result: 在包含5种病理类型和8种MRI模态的8个数据库上评估，该方法能有效处理训练时见过的模态，同时处理新模态以改进分割。

Conclusion: 通过简单的架构修改和创新的图像增强方案，实现了对任意MRI模态的通用分割能力，具有很好的实用性。

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统闭集检测器在域假移和飞行数据损坏情况下性能显著下降，对于安全关键的UAV应用构成风险，需要开集检测来提升稳健性。

Method: 提出模型无关的开集检测框架，通过嵌入空间的熵气模型估计语义不确定性，结合谱标准化和温度缩放技术来增强开集区分能力。

Result: 在AOT空中测试标准和实际飞行测试中验证，相比标准YOLO检测器获得了较高的AUROC指标，相对提升达10%，同时背景拒绝能力也强化了系统稳健性。

Conclusion: 该方法为UAV动态空中环境提供了可靠的感知解决方案，在保持检测准确性的同时显著提升了对未知物体和数据损坏的稳健性。

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

TL;DR: SlotSAR是一个针对SAR图像的目标中心学习框架，通过多级特征提取和注意力机制，无需掩码标注即可将目标表征与背景杂波分离，在SAR图像分类中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的目标与复杂背景杂波（如地形反射和斑点噪声）在强度和模式上相似，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征，影响目标表征的清晰度。

Method: 提出SlotSAR框架：1）从SARATR-X提取高级语义特征；2）从小波散射网络提取低级散射特征；3）设计多级slot注意力模块整合多级特征，增强slot-wise表征区分度。

Result: 实验结果表明SlotSAR在SAR图像分类中实现了最先进的性能，相比现有OCL方法更好地保留了结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过多级特征互补和注意力机制，有效解决了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波分离的挑战，无需掩码标注即可实现清晰的目标表征。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Result: 评估显示现有MLLMs与人类专家存在显著性能差距，在处理需要高级专业知识和复杂视觉感知的问题时表现退化，简单的少样本和思维链提示无法缓解这些限制

Conclusion: 现有MLLMs对真实世界材料表征场景的适应性仍然有限，MatCha基准将促进新材料发现和自主科学智能体等领域的未来研究

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Motivation: 解决真实场景中不同车辆模型异构性带来的协作感知挑战，避免传统方法需要联合训练或预存所有可能协作者模型的不实用性

Method: 将问题建模为少样本无监督域适应，在推理时动态自训练适配器进行特征对齐

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上表现优异，仅使用少量无标注数据即可达到与全数据集训练的SOTA方法相当的性能

Conclusion: PHCP框架成功实现了无需联合训练的异构协作感知，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Conclusion: 预训练数据与目标任务的领域相关性比数据规模更重要，适当整合领域相关数据和特定手术数据能显著提升少样本手术技能评估性能

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and

behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's
reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

TL;DR: 无监督IC缺陷分割框架，不需外部正常数据支持，通过从测试图像中提取正常特征并重建来识别缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IC缺陷分割方法需要外部正常数据库对比，但在IC制造中布局差异大、对齐困难，使得这种方法弱肉

Method: 使用可学习的正常信息提取器从测试图像中聚合具有代表性的正常特征，通过一致性损失确保这些特征与正常区域关联，然后用解码器重建正常内容，通过重建殊差进行缺陷分割

Result: 在三个IC制造过程段的数据集上进行实验，结果显示该方法比现有方法更一致地提升了性能，并且对产品变化具有强壁的稳健性

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种无需外部正常数据的高效IC缺陷检测方法，能够应对不同产品和布局变化带来的挑战

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于构建更安全、更可信的临床用视觉语言模型，通过减少领域偏移下的不可预测行为来提高模型可靠性。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

TL;DR: FS-Diff是一个语义引导和清晰度感知的图像融合与超分辨率联合方法，通过条件生成方式统一处理这两个任务，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于密集自监督学习的显式语义集中方法，通过解耦补丁对应关系和对象感知过滤来解决密集表示学习中的过分散问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像级自监督学习方法在密集任务中存在过分散现象，即来自同一实例/类别的补丁分散，影响下游密集任务的性能。研究发现图像级SSL通过隐式语义集中避免此问题，但这种方法不适用于空间敏感的密集SSL和复杂的场景中心数据。

Method: 1. 通过提取补丁对应关系来打破严格的空间对齐；2. 提出噪声容忍排序损失，将平均精度(AP)损失扩展到连续目标；3. 提出对象感知过滤器，通过跨注意力将输出空间映射到基于对象的空间，用可学习原型表示补丁。

Result: 在各种任务上的实证研究有力地支持了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式语义集中成功解决了密集自监督学习中的过分散问题，为密集表示学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse方法能够有效处理任意数量的输入模态，在多种图像融合任务中均表现出优异的性能，为临床诊断提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Conclusion: 该模型在数据质量和数量有限的情况下表现出良好的泛化能力，具有在低资源地区临床部署的实用性，有助于缩小全球健康AI公平性差距。

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

Conclusion: 动量约束提供了一种物理基础的方法来关联局部关节行为与全局位移，有效解决了局部与全局运动耦合的建模问题

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

TL;DR: DualTrack是一种新颖的双编码器架构，通过解耦的局部和全局编码器分别处理超声图像中的细粒度特征和高级解剖特征，实现了传感器无关的3D超声重建，平均重建误差低于5毫米。

Motivation: 传统3D超声系统成本高且复杂，限制了其广泛应用。传感器无关的3D超声技术使用深度学习从2D图像序列估计探头轨迹，但现有方法要么忽略全局特征，要么将其与局部特征提取紧密耦合，无法有效建模这两个互补方面。

Method: 提出DualTrack双编码器架构：局部编码器使用密集时空卷积捕获细粒度特征；全局编码器使用图像主干网络（如2D CNN或基础模型）和时间注意力层嵌入高级解剖特征和长程依赖；轻量级融合模块结合这些特征来估计轨迹。

Conclusion: DualTrack通过解耦的局部和全局特征提取，有效解决了传感器无关3D超声重建中的特征建模问题，为低成本3D超声技术的广泛应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this
area, the dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/wzyabcas/InterAct, and will be actively maintained.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了基于深度学习的阿尔茨海默病MRI诊断中存在的种族和性别捷径学习与偏见问题，通过多数据集和模型验证了分布偏移和性能偏差的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习算法在MRI脑部成像诊断中可能学习到与保护属性相关的虚假特征，导致对 underrepresented 群体的性能偏见，需要系统研究这种捷径学习和偏见问题。

Method: 使用ResNet和SwinTransformer模型，首先验证算法是否能从3D脑MRI识别种族和性别以确认分布偏移，然后研究训练集不平衡导致的性能下降，最后对特征归因进行定量和定性分析。

Result: 实验证明在基于深度学习的AD分类中存在种族和性别相关的捷径学习和偏见，模型能够识别保护属性，训练集不平衡会导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发更公平的脑MRI深度学习诊断工具奠定了基础，揭示了当前方法中存在的偏见问题，并提供了代码供进一步研究。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

TL;DR: PeftCD是一个基于视觉基础模型(VFMs)和参数高效微调(PEFT)的变化检测框架，通过LoRA和Adapter模块实现高效任务适应，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多时相多源遥感影像中伪变化普遍、标注样本稀缺和跨域泛化困难的问题

Method: 使用权重共享的Siamese编码器，集成LoRA和Adapter模块，采用SAM2和DINOv3作为骨干网络，配合轻量级解码器

Result: 在SYSU-CD(IoU 73.81%)、WHUCD(92.05%)、MSRSCD(64.07%)、MLCD(76.89%)、CDD(97.01%)、S2Looking(52.25%)和LEVIR-CD(85.62%)等多个数据集上达到最优性能

Conclusion: PeftCD在准确性、效率和泛化性之间实现了最佳平衡，为大规模VFM适应实际遥感变化检测应用提供了强大且可扩展的范式

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有微秒级精度和优异动态性能，但在自然语言理解方面的多模态感知研究存在空白，需要填补这一技术缺口。

Method: 构建基于真实驾驶场景的大规模数据集，每个指代表达式包含外观、状态、与观察者关系、与周围物体关系四个结构化属性，显式捕捉时空和关系线索。

Result: 创建了包含丰富标注信息的数据集，支持超越简单目标识别的上下文推理，实现可解释和组合式的目标定位。

Conclusion: Talk2Event为推进多模态和时间感知感知技术奠定了基础，在机器人、人机交互等领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar是一个新颖的级联框架，通过多模态指令理解和照片级真实感人像生成的统一方法，解决了现有音频驱动虚拟形象生成方法在叙事连贯性和角色表现力方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将指令条件仅视为由声学或视觉线索驱动的低级跟踪，而没有建模指令传达的交流目的，这损害了叙事连贯性和角色表现力。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段设计多模态大语言模型导演，基于多样化指令信号生成蓝图视频，控制高级语义如角色动作和情感；第二阶段在蓝图关键帧指导下，使用首尾帧策略并行生成多个子片段。

Result: 能够生成生动、流畅、长时长的1080p 48fps视频，在唇同步准确性、情感和动态表现力、指令可控性、身份保持和跨域泛化方面表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为语义基础的高保真音频驱动虚拟形象合成建立了新的基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测脑肿瘤的时空进展对于指导神经肿瘤学临床决策至关重要，需要在数据有限的情况下实现生物学信息驱动的图像生成

Method: 使用常微分方程系统的机制模型捕捉肿瘤时间动态（包括放疗效果），结合梯度引导的DDIM扩散模型进行图像合成，确保与预测生长和患者解剖结构对齐

Result: 在BraTS成人和儿童胶质瘤数据集上训练，在60个儿童弥漫中线胶质瘤病例上评估，生成逼真的随访扫描，提供肿瘤生长概率图，显示临床相关生长范围和方向性

Conclusion: 该方法在数据有限情况下实现生物学信息驱动的图像生成，提供考虑机制先验的生成式时空预测

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型基准测试主要关注识别准确性，但忽视了模型识别何时所有选项都不正确的重要能力，这在安全关键应用中至关重要。

Method: 基于全景场景图数据集构建，利用细粒度场景图注释提取真实实体和关系，使用GPT-4-Turbo生成多选题，并经过严格的人工筛选过程，每个问题都包含"以上都不是"选项。

Result: 评估了多种最先进的多模态大语言模型（包括通用和专用推理模型），并分享了有价值的发现和见解。

Conclusion: HumbleBench通过引入明确的错误选项拒绝机制，为当前评估套件填补了关键空白，为安全关键环境中的MLLM可靠性提供了更真实的衡量标准。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

TL;DR: UAE框架通过Auto-Encoder视角统一多模态学习，将图像理解作为编码器(I2T)，图像生成作为解码器(T2I)，使用重建保真度作为统一训练目标，通过强化学习实现双向信息流和相互增益。


<details>

Motivation: 提出统一多模态学习的创新范式，通过重建保真度目标强制理解和生成过程之间的双向信息流动，实现相互提升。

Method: 1) 使用大规模长上下文图像描述预训练解码器；2) 提出Unified-GRPO强化学习方法，包含冷启动阶段、生成促进理解阶段、理解促进生成阶段；3) 引入Unified-Bench评估基准。

Result: 随着强化学习进展，编码器自主产生更具描述性的标题，解码器同时展示出理解复杂描述的能力，实现高保真度重建，产生令人惊喜的"顿悟时刻"。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了多模态理解与生成的统一，通过双向信息流带来相互增益，为多模态学习提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Motivation: 现有基于VAE或扩散的方法在3D人体运动恢复中存在局限性，需要一种能够保持运动物理合理性和时间一致性的更强先验模型。

Method: 在关节旋转、角速度和角加速度的乘积空间上构建神经距离场，提出自适应步长混合投影算法和几何积分器来生成合理运动轨迹。

Conclusion: NRMF通过几何感知的神经距离场方法，为3D人体运动恢复提供了强大的先验模型，具有优异的泛化能力和多任务适应性。

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

Conclusion: 扩散模型的局部性主要是数据统计特性的结果，而非网络架构的归纳偏置，这一发现有助于构建更准确的解析模型

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured

statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to
catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page:
