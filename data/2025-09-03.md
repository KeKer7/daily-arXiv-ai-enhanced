*Yuqi Li,Chuanguang Yang,Junhao Dong,Zhengtao Yao,Haoyan Xu,Zeyu Dong,Hansheng Zeng,Zhulin An,Yingli Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AMMKD框架，通过多模态特征融合、多教师知识蒸馏和自适应优化，实现轻量高效的图像-文本检索模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言预训练模型在移动设备部署受限，需要解决模型大小和计算复杂度问题

Method: 多模态特征融合网络提取图像和文本特征，多教师知识蒸馏框架预训练两个CLIP教师模型，使用KL散度进行概率分布匹配，自适应动态权重方案处理多目标优化

Result: 在三个基准数据集上验证了优越性能，同时显著降低模型复杂度

Conclusion: AMMKD框架有效解决了移动设备部署问题，实现了轻量高效的图像-文本检索

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MESTI新动态输入模态和MEGANet网络，通过梯度注意力机制提升微表情识别性能，在多个数据集上达到最先进水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统输入模态（Apex Frame、光流、动态图像）难以充分捕捉微表情的细微短暂特征，导致识别性能不佳

Method: 提出MESTI将视频序列转换为单张图像并保留微运动特征；设计MEGANet网络，引入梯度注意力块增强细粒度运动特征提取

Result: 在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上达到最先进性能，MEGANet与MESTI组合获得迄今最高准确率，替换现有网络输入也能带来性能提升

Conclusion: MESTI是优越的输入模态，MEGANet是先进的识别网络，为更有效的微表情识别系统铺平道路

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

### [6] [Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation with Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00062)
*Justin Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaffold Diffusion是一个用于生成稀疏多类别3D体素结构的生成模型，使用离散扩散语言模型处理体素作为token，在98%稀疏度的数据上仍能生成真实连贯的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D体素结构生成中的两个主要挑战：体素结构的立方内存扩展和由稀疏性引起的显著类别不平衡问题。

Method: 将体素视为token，使用离散扩散语言模型来生成3D体素结构，扩展了离散扩散模型在空间连贯3D结构生成中的应用。

Result: 在Minecraft房屋结构数据集上评估，相比现有基线和自回归方法，Scaffold Diffusion能够生成更真实和连贯的结构，即使在超过98%稀疏度的数据上训练。

Conclusion: 离散扩散为3D稀疏体素生成建模提供了一个有前景的框架，能够有效处理高度稀疏的3D结构生成任务。

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

### [7] [Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108)
*Anas M. Ali,Anis Koubaa,Bilel Benjdira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SGLC框架解决高分辨率图像去雾问题，通过全局特征生成器和局部特征增强器的组合，在保持全局上下文的同时增强局部细节，显著提升高分辨率去雾性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去雾模型在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，通常需要降采样或分块处理导致性能下降，主要原因是难以有效结合全局上下文信息和局部精细细节

Method: SGLC框架包含两个组件：全局特征生成器(GFG)产生初步去雾结果，局部特征增强器(LFE)细化局部细节和像素级特征，实现全局外观与局部结构的交互

Result: 在Uformer架构上集成SGLC后，高分辨率数据集上的PSNR指标显著提升，表明该方法能有效处理大规模雾化图像

Conclusion: SGLC设计是模型无关的，任何去雾网络都可以通过这种全局-局部特征融合机制进行增强，同时利用场景级线索和细节信息，显著提高高分辨率环境下的视觉保真度

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

### [8] [Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00131)
*Ivan Slootweg,Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente,Geert Litjens,Salma Dammak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了首个大规模自监督异常检测模型用于肾脏毒理病理学，通过UNI基础模型特征提取和自监督方法，在158种化合物的药物安全性评估研究中实现了优于随机水平的异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肾脏异常检测是临床前药物开发的关键环节，但传统方法需要人工检查数百到数千张全切片图像，耗时耗力且成本高昂。大多数图像都是正常的，需要检测出指示毒性效应的细微变化。

Method: 使用UNI基础模型提取特征，发现简单的k近邻分类器性能不佳。随后采用自监督方法对相同特征进行处理，实现了更好的异常检测性能。

Result: 自监督方法在接收者操作特征曲线下面积达到0.62，阴性预测值达到89%，表现优于随机水平。基础模型生成的特征单独使用不足以检测异常。

Conclusion: 通过进一步开发，此类模型可用于在药物安全性评估研究中排除正常切片，从而降低药物开发相关成本和时间。

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Result: 研究结果揭示了VLLMs在复杂环境下的性能表现，为理解这些模型在挑战性条件下的能力提供了宝贵见解。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要进一步提升VLLMs的鲁棒性，以在复杂环境中表现更好。数据集和实验代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of
visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance
on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly
explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having
deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset
specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios,
characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with
this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess
the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive
analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under
challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further
advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments.
The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.

### [10] [Category-level Text-to-Image Retrieval Improved: Bridging the Domain Gap with Diffusion Models and Vision Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00177)
*Faizan Farooq Khan,Vladan Stojnić,Zakaria Laskar,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过生成扩散模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询，然后结合视觉模型进行图像检索的两步方法，有效解决了文本和图像在表示空间中的模态差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然像CLIP这样的视觉-语言模型提供了开箱即用的文本到图像检索解决方案，但文本和图像在表示空间中映射到相距较远的区域，限制了检索性能。需要弥合这种模态差距。

Method: 采用两步方法：1）使用生成扩散模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询；2）使用视觉模型估计图像到图像的相似性。还引入了聚合网络，将多个生成图像合并为单一向量表示，并融合两种查询模态的相似性分数。

Result: 广泛的评估表明，该方法在性能上持续优于仅依赖文本查询的检索方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了视觉编码器、视觉-语言模型和文本到图像生成模型的最新进展，成功弥合了文本和图像之间的模态差距，显著提升了文本到图像检索的性能。

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

### [11] [Safe-LLaVA: A Privacy-Preserving Vision-Language Dataset and Benchmark for Biometric Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00192)
*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PRISM基准测试和Safe-LLaVA数据集，用于评估和减少多模态大语言模型中的生物特征信息泄露问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言任务时经常推断和泄露敏感的生物特征信息（如种族、性别、年龄等），即使这些信息没有被明确要求，这在现实应用和社会敏感领域中存在严重隐私风险

Method: 1) 引入PRISM基准测试，评估模型在两个方面：拒绝生物特征相关查询和在一般响应中避免隐含生物特征泄露；2) 对LLaVA数据集进行详细审计，发现广泛存在的生物特征泄露；3) 构建Safe-LLaVA数据集，通过系统性地移除显性和隐性生物特征信息

Result: 评估显示不同MLLM模型在各种生物特征属性上都存在泄露问题。在Safe-LLaVA数据集上微调的模型显著减少了生物特征泄露

Conclusion: Safe-LLaVA和PRISM为隐私对齐的MLLM开发和评估设立了新标准，提供了公开可用的数据集和基准测试

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,
and the source code is available at
https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEME是一种新颖的跨模态对齐方法，通过构建以自我为中心的经验世界模型，显著提升了视觉语言模型在动态环境中的时空推理和导航能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在静态场景理解方面表现出色，但在动态开放环境中的时空推理和适应性方面存在局限，特别是在任务导向导航和具身问答等任务中，缺乏对细粒度时空线索和物理世界理解的建模。

Method: 提出VEME框架，包含三个核心组件：跨模态对齐框架连接对象、空间表示和视觉语义；动态隐式认知地图通过世界嵌入激活任务相关的几何-语义记忆召回；基于指令的导航推理框架利用具身先验进行长期规划和高效探索。

Result: 在VSI-Bench和VLN-CE基准测试中，相比传统方法实现了1%-3%的准确率和探索效率提升。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入几何感知的时空经验，该方法显著改善了动态环境中的推理和规划能力，为解决具身智能中的复杂任务提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

TL;DR: 提出多模态深度学习框架，整合乳腺超声图像和临床数据，提高叶状肿瘤分类准确率，减少不必要的手术切除


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叶状肿瘤在影像学上与良性纤维腺瘤相似，术前分类困难，常导致不必要的手术切除，需要开发更准确的诊断方法

Method: 开发双分支神经网络，从81例确诊患者的超声图像和临床数据中提取并融合特征，使用类别感知采样和分层交叉验证防止数据偏差

Result: 多模态方法优于单模态基线，ConvNeXt和ResNet18表现最佳，AUC-ROC分别达0.9427和0.9349，F1分数分别为0.6720和0.7294

Conclusion: 多模态AI有潜力作为非侵入性诊断工具，减少不必要活检，改善乳腺肿瘤管理的临床决策

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark
matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over
the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages

*Danil Kazimirov,Dmitry Nikolaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FHT2SP算法，在保持常数有界误差的同时实现近最优计算复杂度，解决了传统快速Hough变换算法在精度和效率之间的权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有快速Hough变换算法存在精度与计算效率的权衡：FHT算法具有最优线性复杂度但精度随尺度恶化，而精确HT算法误差有界但计算成本接近立方复杂度

Method: 基于Brady的超像素概念，将其扩展到任意形状（超越原始2的幂次方约束），并将其集成到FHT2DT算法中，通过适当选择超像素尺寸来控制精度

Result: FHT2SP算法达到近最优计算复杂度O(wh ln³ w)，同时保持与图像尺寸无关的常数有界近似误差，误差可通过元参数控制

Conclusion: FHT2SP算法成功解决了Hough变换中精度与效率的长期权衡问题，为各种应用提供了既快速又高精度的解决方案

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种语言引导的生成式视觉系统，用于制造业残留轮廓检测，通过条件GAN和视觉语言建模实现CAD级精度，在工业数据集上显著提升轮廓保真度和几何对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业计算机视觉系统常受噪声、材料变异和非受控成像条件影响，传统边缘检测器和手工流程效果有限，需要更精确的解决方案。

Method: 三阶段系统：数据采集预处理、条件GAN轮廓生成、视觉语言模型多模态轮廓精炼，采用人机协作的标准提示词和图像-文本引导合成。

Result: 在FabTrack数据集上改善了轮廓保真度，增强了边缘连续性和几何对齐，减少了手动追踪。GPT-image-1在结构准确性和感知质量上 consistently 优于Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: VLM引导的生成式工作流程有望推动工业计算机视觉超越传统流程的限制，展示了在制造业中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出LIMO方法，一种基于信息论和参数高效微调(PEFT)的transductive few-shot CLIP方法，在视觉-语言模型中实现了显著的性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前transductive few-shot学习主要集中在视觉模型，而在基础视觉-语言模型(VLMs)中研究较少。现有方法表明transductive在VLMs中具有潜力，但需要专门为VLM定制的方法

Method: 提出Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO)损失函数，包含三个互补项：视觉输入与文本类别描述的互信息、KL散度惩罚项（约束网络输出与零样本预测的偏差）、基于标注样本的标准交叉熵损失。同时探索参数高效微调策略

Result: LIMO大幅超越近期transductive few-shot CLIP方法，相比最佳inductive方法也有显著提升。PEFT策略带来了性能的实质性提升

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在transductive few-shot设置中调整模型参数子集的潜力，为视觉-语言模型的少样本学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphGen是一种通过显式建模核形态和空间组织来提高组织病理学图像域泛化能力的方法，使用监督对比学习框架整合图像和核分割掩码，优先关注诊断特征而非染色伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织病理学中的域泛化受到全切片图像异质性的阻碍，而病理学家依赖跨域不变的形态学线索进行诊断。受此启发，研究者假设显式建模生物学上稳健的核形态和空间组织能够学习对域偏移具有弹性的癌症表示。

Method: 提出MorphGen方法，在监督对比学习框架中整合组织病理学图像、增强和核分割掩码。通过对齐图像和核掩码的潜在表示，优先关注核和形态学异型性及空间组织。还结合随机权重平均(SWA)来增强分布外鲁棒性。

Result: 注意力图分析显示MorphGen主要依赖核形态、细胞组成和空间细胞组织进行分类。学习到的表示对图像损坏(如染色伪影)和对抗攻击具有弹性，展示了OOD泛化能力并解决了数字病理学中深度学习系统的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: MorphGen通过显式建模生物学相关的形态学特征，成功提高了组织病理学图像的域泛化能力，为数字病理学中的深度学习系统提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

Method: 提出互信息基于的视觉到序列剪枝策略：1）移除与文本到序列语义不对齐的视觉到序列；2）通过最大化嵌入空间中预期成对距离来移除重复视觉到序列。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NEXT-7B模型上实验显示，方法能够减少88.9%的到序列数量，推理速度提升56.7%，同时保持了强劲的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过专注于视觉到序列的有效剪枝，在显著降低计算复杂度的同时保持了多模态对齐和表征质量，为大型多模态模型的高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Motivation: 现有单域泛化方法忽视了一个容易获得的资源：目标部署环境的文本描述。这些文本元数据在实践中常见但被忽视，可以指导模型在严重数据限制下的泛化。

Method: 提出STAR(Spectral TARget Alignment)模块：1)利用CLIP等视觉-语言模型，从目标描述的文本嵌入中提取目标锚定子空间 2)通过光谱投影将图像特征向目标域重心化，保留与目标索引对齐的方向 3)使用视觉-语言蓄粉对齐背榜特征 4)采用特征空间Mixup确保源和目标表征之间的平滑迁移

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了实践中常见但忽视的文本元数据资源的重要价值，为在未见数据的目标环境中部署健壮模型开启了新途径。

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

achieving up to 92.02% classification accuracy and an RMSE of 7.70 with the
EfficientNet-B0 backbone. The model delivers an 18.5% improvement over

TL;DR: ILRNet是一种结合模型驱动和数据驱动方法的迭代低秩网络，通过将秩最小化模块嵌入U-Net架构，在特征域中利用HSI的光谱低秩性进行有效去噪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI去噪是后续处理的关键预处理步骤。干净的HSI通常存在于低维子空间中，可以通过低秩和稀疏表示来捕获，但如何充分使用这种物理特性进行有效去噪同时保留图像细节是一个挑战。

Method: ILRNet将秩最小化模块(RMM)嵌入U-Net架构，该模块将特征图转换到小波域并对低频分量应用奇异值阈值(SVT)。参数从数据中自适应学习，并采用迭代细化过程自适应结合中间去噪结果和噪声输入。

Result: 实验结果表明，ILRNet在合成和真实世界噪声去除任务中都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ILRNet通过结合模型驱动和数据驱动方法的优势，有效利用了HSI的光谱低秩特性，实现了渐进式增强和优异的图像细节保留能力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

Conclusion: 这个研究揭示了当前对象幻觉研究中的关键误匹配问题，为开发更稳健和平衡的幻觉减少策略指明了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPO-VLM是一个针对视觉语言模型的两阶段防御框架，通过激活干预和策略优化来增强模型对抗对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持视觉理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导防御方法依赖任务特定的对比提示来提取有害方向，性能不佳且会降低视觉定位能力，需要更有效的防御方案

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段计算自适应层特定引导向量来抑制有害行为；第二阶段通过序列级偏好优化（整合毒性评估和视觉一致性奖励）来精炼引导向量

Result: SPO-VLM显著增强了对抗攻击的安全性，同时在良性任务上保持强性能且不损害视觉理解能力

Conclusion: SPO-VLM通过结合激活级干预和策略级优化，在效率和效果之间取得了平衡，为VLM提供了有效的对抗防御解决方案

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了适配性点提示微调(APPT)方法，通过直接利用点特征来微调领先训练的多模态基础模型，以支持3D点云分析，避免了异构映射导致的空间几何信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于3D点云数据稀缺，领先训练大型3D模型很困难。现有方法通过"高维到低维"映射将领先训练的视觉模型应用于3D领域，但这会导致空间几何信息丢失，且缺乏通用性框架。

Method: 提出APPT方法：1)将原始点云转换为点嵌入表示，聚合局部几何特征；2)使用排列不变性特征捕捉相对位置，获得含位置信息的点标志；3)通过与点嵌入模块共享权重的提示生成器，动态生成点提示，不增加额外参数。

Result: 该方法能够以较少的参数量微调领先训练模型，支持直接的3D点云处理，避免了异构映射带来的问题，同时减少了计算开销。

Conclusion: APPT提供了一种通用性的框架，能够将任意模态的领先训练模型适配到3D点云分析，为解决3D数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

TL;DR: 基于温巡模型的数据增帽方法NoiseCutMix，通过结合两个类别的估计噪声来生成自然、高分辨率的多类别融合图像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CutMix等传统多类别图像结合方法存在的边界不自然问题，利用温巡模型的高质量图像生成能力来创造更自然的多类融合数据

Method: 在温巡模型的噪声估计过程中，部分结合两个不同类别对应的估计噪声，从而生成具有两个类别融合特征的自然高分辨率图像

Result: 在分类实验中，该方法在效果上超过了传统的多类别数据增帽技术、随机图像生成方法以及它们的组合方法

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix能够生成自然且高质量的多类融合图像，在数据增帽效果上表现优异，为深度学习模型提供了更有效的训练数据

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

<details>

Motivation: 3D LiDAR点云语义分割需要大量标注数据，成本高昂且耗时。相比之下，2D图像数据集更容易获得且规模更大。

Method: 使用无监督域适应知识蒸馏(UDAKD)和基于特征与语义的知识蒸馏(FSKD)，通过已知的2D-3D对应关系，将2D网络输出与3D网络对应点对齐。在3D点云上部署自校准卷积作为域适应模块的基础。

Conclusion: 提出的跨模态知识蒸馏方法能够有效利用丰富的2D图像数据来提升3D点云分割性能，避免了昂贵的3D标注需求，同时保持了模态通用信息并过滤掉模态特定细节。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

Motivation: 传统叙事分析需要将各种形式数据转化为手写叙事故事，给研究者和参与者带来沉重数据分析负担，需要更高效、参与者友好的叙事制作和呈现方法。

Method: 开发NAME范式，包含演员定位和形状模块以促进合理图像生成，设计包含三个关键维度的评估指标来客观衡量生成角色的感知质量和叙事一致性。

Result: 在不同数据划分方案下均表现最优，仅用0.96%数据就将FID从195降至152；在相同数据量下，70:30划分FID从175降至152，95:5划分从96降至49；新指标得分3.62超越基线2.66。

Conclusion: NAME范式成功减轻了叙事分析中的认知负担，通过少量数据实现显著性能提升，为叙事探究领域提供了更高效和参与者友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 第一人称视频中频繁剧烈的视角变化导致物体外观变化大和部分遮挡严重，现有方法难以实现精确定位

Method: 提出HERO-VQL方法，包含：1）Top-down Attention Guidance利用类别token提供高层上下文和主成分得分图进行细粒度定位；2）EgoACT通过替换查询对象和重排序视频帧来增强查询多样性并模拟极端视角变化，同时使用CT损失确保不同增强场景下的稳定定位

Result: 在VQ2D数据集上的大量实验验证了HERO-VQL能有效处理第一人称视角挑战，显著超越基线方法

Conclusion: HERO-VQL受人类认知过程启发，通过分层注意力引导和一致性训练，成功解决了第一人称视频中的物体定位难题

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双约束扩散模型(DCDM)用于超低剂量PET重建，通过冻结预训练扩散模型权重并注入可训练的双约束控制器，大幅减少可训练参数数量，适应不同剂量水平而无需重新训练所有参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET重建可减少患者辐射暴露和检查时间，但会导致噪声增加和成像细节减少，降低图像质量。需要一种灵活的方法来适应不同剂量水平。

Method: DCDM包含核变换器约束(NTC)和编码连接约束(ENC)两个模块。NTC利用核范数近似矩阵秩最小化，将低秩特性整合到Transformer架构中，从低剂量图像提取信息并转换为潜在空间的压缩特征表示。ENC利用这些特征表示编码和控制预训练扩散模型。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和临床数据集上的实验表明，DCDM在已知剂量减少因子(DRF)上优于最先进方法，在未知DRF场景下泛化良好，即使在超低剂量水平(如全剂量的1%)也很有价值。

Conclusion: DCDM通过双约束控制器有效减少了可训练参数数量，提高了重建灵活性，能够适应不同剂量水平而无需重新训练所有模型参数，在超低剂量PET重建中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景视频在VR和遥感等领域应用广泛，但其广角视野常导致不需要的物体出现在视频中。现有视频修复方法主要针对普通窄视野视频，无法处理全景视频等距柱状投影的畸变问题

Method: DAOVI模型包含两个核心模块：1）基于测地距离评估图像空间时间运动信息的模块；2）特征空间中设计的深度感知特征传播模块，专门处理全景视频的几何畸变

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性评估上都优于现有方法

Conclusion: DAOVI通过专门设计的畸变感知模块，成功解决了全景视频修复中的几何畸变问题，为全景视频处理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: 通过利用视频生成模型提供多视角监督信号，结合身份注入和块去噪策略，成功提升了单目视频人体化身重建的质量和细节表现

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightVLM是一种无需训练即可显著加速视觉语言模型推理的方法，通过在编码阶段使用金字塔令牌合并减少图像令牌，在解码阶段使用KV缓存压缩提高网络吞吐量，实现2-3倍的加速同时保持98-100%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型推理过程存在效率低下的问题，特别是在处理长序列输出时延迟较高，需要一种无需重新训练的高效加速方法。

Method: 将VLM推理分为编码和解码两个阶段：编码阶段使用金字塔令牌分层合并技术，只保留少量主导令牌；解码阶段采用KV缓存压缩技术，移除不必要的缓存以提高吞吐量。

Result: 仅保留35%图像令牌时可保持100%性能，仅保留3%图像令牌时仍保持98%性能。网络吞吐量提升2.02倍，预填充时间减少3.65倍，长序列生成时推理时间减少3.21倍。

Conclusion: LightVLM能够在不损失性能的情况下显著加速大型视觉语言模型的推理，使重型模型比小型模型推理更快，有望促进实际部署应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its

Conclusion: SemaMIL通过整合语义重排序和语义引导状态空间建模，在保持组织学意义的同时有效提升了全局建模能力，为计算病理学提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

*Bo Wu,Zhiqi Ai,Jun Jiang,Congcong Zhu,Shugong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SA-LDL算法，通过阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数，有效解决年龄估计中的标签模糊性问题，在MORPH-II和FG-NET数据集上分别达到1.74和2.15的MAE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过标签分布学习建模相邻年龄组的相关性，但忽略了不同年龄阶段存在的不同程度的标签模糊性。

Method: 提出阶段自适应标签分布学习(SA-LDL)算法，基于嵌入相似性分析发现标签模糊性呈现明显的阶段性模式，采用阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数。

Result: 在MORPH-II和FG-NET数据集上分别达到1.74和2.15的MAE，表现出竞争性性能。

Conclusion: SA-LDL能够有效捕捉标签模糊性的复杂结构化特征，实现更准确和鲁棒的年龄估计。

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

*Xiang Chen,Renjiu Hu,Jinwei Zhang,Yuxi Zhang,Xinyao Yue,Min Liu,Yaonan Wang,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR)框架，通过分离特征学习和光流估计，使用3层卷积网络进行特征提取，构建拉普拉斯特征金字塔，在大变形模型下实现渐进式可微变形，在精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于学习的技术显著提高了可变形图像配准的精度和速度，但仍面临计算复杂度高和处理大变形等挑战。研究卷积神经网络在配准中的作用机制，发现其具有线性化局部强度和协调全局对比度变化两个关键功能。

Method: 提出EOIR框架：1）分离特征学习和光流估计；2）仅使用3层ConvNet进行特征提取；3）使用一组3层光流估计器构建拉普拉斯特征金字塔；4）在大变形模型下渐进式组合可微变形。

Result: 在五个不同模态和解剖区域的数据集上验证了EOIR的有效性，实现了优越的精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡。在保持相当精度的同时，提供更好的效率和平滑度。

Conclusion: EOIR框架通过分析ConvNet在配准中的作用机制，设计出更高效的架构，在精度、效率和平滑度之间取得了更好的平衡，为解决可变形图像配准的挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on
https://github.com/XiangChen1994/EOIR.

Motivation: 为研究大语言模型（LLM）的决策能力提供一个简单但具有挑战性的测试环境，Jump-Jump游戏能够有效评估模型在空间推理、物理计算和策略规划等方面的综合表现

Method: 通过Jump-Jump游戏机制，要求玩家（或模型）根据当前角色位置与目标平台的距离，精确计算并控制跳跃力度，实现跨平台移动并最大化得分

Result: 该游戏设计能够有效测试LLM在复杂决策任务中的表现，特别是空间感知、物理推理和长期规划能力的整合

*Zhihong Zhang,Xiaojian Huang,Jin Xu,Zhuodong Luo,Xinzhi Wang,Jiansheng Wei,Xuejin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoRewardBench是首个全面的视频多模态奖励模型评估基准，覆盖感知、知识、推理和安全四个核心维度，包含1,563个高质量标注样本，评估了28个模型，发现当前最佳模型准确率仅57.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态奖励模型评估基准存在样本数量少、多样性不足、评估维度不全面等问题，需要构建更全面的评估体系。

Method: 通过AI辅助数据管道构建包含1,563个标注样本的高质量偏好数据集，每个样本包含视频-文本提示、选择响应和拒绝响应的三元组，评估了生成式、判别式和半标量三类共28个多模态奖励模型。

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4o仅达到57.0%的总体准确率，开源最佳模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B为53.3%。研究发现：RL训练不一定带来更好的跨模态泛化；除判别式模型外，其他模型都能从推理时缩放中受益；不同帧数对不同类型模型影响不同。

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench为视频领域多模态奖励模型的评估和发展提供了具有挑战性和价值的基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性并提出了重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

### [44] [Multi-Focused Video Group Activities Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00490)
*Zhongmiao Qi,Yan Jiang,Bolin Zhang,Lijun Guo,Chong Wang,Qiangbo Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新的视频哈希方法（STVH和M-STVH），用于细粒度的群体活动检索索引，能同时处理对象动态和群体交互特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂场景中视频数据的爆发式增长，快速检索群体活动成为紧迫需求。现有方法多只能检索整个视频，而不能处理活动级别的细粒度检索。

Method: STVH通过统一框架同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，捕捉空间时间演化特征。M-STVH作为增强版本，通过多重焦点表征学习实现层次特征集成，能同时关注活动语义特征和对象视觉特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上进行的对比实验中，STVH和M-STVH都能达到优异的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了有效的解决方案，能够在细粒度上实现高效的群体活动视频检索，适应不同的实际检索需求。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

*Nhat-Tuong Do-Tran,Ngoc-Hoang-Lam Le,Ian Chiu,Po-Tsun Paul Kuo,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST是一个针对超声图像风格迁移的双流框架，通过token驱动机制选择合适的目标风格token，保持源内容的同时迁移目标域风格，提升下游任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同设备采集的超声图像存在风格差异，导致下游任务性能下降。现有无配对图像转换方法未能充分考虑下游任务需求，可能产生不合适的风格迁移

Method: 提出token驱动的双流框架，包含数据视角选择合适目标token和模型视角识别最优目标token，并注入辅助提示来匹配下游任务行为

Result: 在超声数据集上的实验表明，TRUST在视觉质量和下游任务性能方面均优于现有无配对图像转换方法

Conclusion: TRUST框架通过有效分离内容和风格特征，实现了更好的超声图像风格迁移，显著提升了下游任务的性能表现

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ATGC方法，通过注意力引导的动态尺度选择来解决黑盒模型蒸馏中的分辨率诅咒问题，仅需one-hot预测即可实现有效的本地模型训练


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIaaS的普及使得预训练模型通过API提供服务，但黑盒模型不暴露权重、训练数据或logits，当前领域自适应方法在这种约束下不实用，需要新的蒸馏方法

Method: 提出ATGC方法，利用DINOv2注意力图通过熵评分动态选择最优尺度进行黑盒模型推理，识别信息丰富的尺度进行伪标注以实现有效蒸馏

Result: 实验表明该方法在黑盒监督下在多个数据集上取得显著改进，仅需one-hot API预测

Conclusion: ATGC方法成功解决了黑盒蒸馏中的分辨率诅咒问题，为仅使用one-hot预测的有效模型蒸馏提供了可行方案

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

TL;DR: 提出LBD框架解决CISS中的语义纠缠问题，利用CLIP的语言先验进行特征解耦，在Pascal VOC和ADE20k上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CISS方法存在原型-特征纠缠和背景-增量纠缠问题，导致语义错位和噪声

Method: 使用语言引导的原型解耦和流形互背景解耦，结合软提示调优和编码器适配

Result: 在Pascal VOC和ADE20k数据集上实现最先进性能，特别在多步场景中表现优异

Conclusion: LBD框架有效解决了CISS中的语义纠缠问题，通过语言引导的特征解耦显著提升了性能

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

TL;DR: BrainFM是一个模态无关的多任务视觉基础模型，通过创新的"轻度到重度"生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，能够处理多种脑成像任务，包括图像合成、分割、距离估计、偏置场估计和配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法在校准医学成像（如CT）中表现优异，但在未校准模态（如MRI）中泛化能力差，对MR对比度、分辨率和方向差异敏感，限制了在多样化临床协议中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出"轻度到重度"主体内生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，使模型对获取图像的外观（如模态、对比度、变形、分辨率、伪影）具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上评估，证明BrainFM在所有任务和输入模态中都具有鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: BrainFM是一个通用的脑成像基础模型，能够直接应用于多种基础脑成像任务，解决了现有方法在未校准模态中的泛化问题。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiffusionDet在上下文依赖场景中性能受限，仅依赖局部特征条件化，需要更好的全局场景理解能力

Method: 引入CAF框架，使用独立编码器生成全局上下文，通过交叉注意力机制让每个目标提案都能关注全面的环境信息

Result: 在CarDD基准测试中显著优于现有state-of-the-art模型，建立了上下文感知目标检测的新性能基准

Conclusion: 全局场景上下文与局部特征的融合能显著提升细粒度目标检测性能，特别是在具有挑战性的视觉领域中

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型从自然图像领域迁移到遥感分割任务时的挑战，包括遥感数据集类别多样性有限以及自然图像与遥感图像之间的领域差距问题。

Method: 提出全局-局部解耦模块：1）使用NLP技术将文本输入分解为局部类别名词和全局修饰语；2）通过无监督掩码提议网络将图像输入分割为类别无关的掩码提议；3）在局部尺度通过上下文感知裁剪策略和RS特定知识增强进行特征对齐；4）在全局尺度使用跨尺度Grad-CAM模块和掩码选择模块实现精确对齐。

Result: 实现了遥感图像的开集语义分割（OVSS）和参考表达分割（RES），提供了准确且可解释的全局和局部维度对齐。

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS框架成功解决了视觉语言模型在遥感分割任务中的迁移挑战，通过解耦和对齐策略实现了无需训练的高性能分割。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Motivation: 甲烷是强效温室气体，需要及时检测以有效减缓气候变化。星载机器学习可以实现快速检测并降低下行链路成本，支持更快的响应系统。传统方法依赖正交校正和匹配滤波器等预处理步骤。

Method: 使用未正交校正的EMIT传感器高光谱图像数据(UnorthoDOS)，训练机器学习模型进行甲烷检测，避免了传统正交校正和匹配滤波器预处理步骤。

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at

Motivation: 现有基于注意力的transformer在多视角3D人体姿态估计中难以准确建模关键点的空间排列，特别是在遮挡场景下，且容易过拟合训练数据中的特定相机配置和视觉场景，导致在新设置中性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: MV-SSM框架通过创新的状态空间建模和扫描机制，有效解决了多视角3D人体姿态估计的泛化问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP
(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations. Project Website:

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FtZ框架通过组合语义强大的锚编码器和感知丰富的增强编码器，解决了MLLMs在细粒度视觉任务上的性能瓶颈，在多个基准测试中显著优于单编码器和现有特征融合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂语义理解方面表现出色，但在需要精确细节感知的基础视觉任务上表现不佳，这源于单一视觉编码器架构在追求高层语义对齐时牺牲了细粒度视觉信息捕捉能力。

Method: 提出FtZ视觉塔框架，创新性地通过轻量级多头交叉注意力机制，将语义强大的锚编码器与感知丰富的增强编码器组合，超越单一编码器设计。

Result: 在TextVQA、POPE、MMMU、MME和MM-Vet等需要细粒度视觉理解的挑战性基准测试中，FtZ模型显著优于仅使用单编码器或现有特征融合方法的基线模型。

Conclusion: 组合异构专家编码器是克服当前MLLMs视觉感知瓶颈的高效有效途径，为构建具有更强感知能力的下一代AI系统提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出STM策略，通过参数高效微调视觉基础模型，仅使用少量正常天气数据实现恶劣天气下的单目深度估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计面临缺乏可靠真值和难以从未标注真实数据学习的挑战，现有方法存在域差距或违反光度假设的问题

Method: 引入选择-调优-保持(STM)策略，基于熵秩和稳定秩结构分解预训练权重，自适应选择秩数和任务感知奇异方向进行初始化，并施加主方向正则化

Result: 在四个真实世界基准测试中，STM不仅优于现有PEFT方法和全微调，还超越了使用恶劣天气合成数据训练的方法，甚至超过了深度基础模型

Conclusion: STM策略能够灵活适应任务同时保持预训练模型的强泛化能力，为恶劣天气下的深度估计提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

Motivation: 挑战传统上评分模型和策略模型分离的设计，诉求开发既能评价输出又能生成响应的统一模型

Method: 将偏好标注的评分模型数据重新组织为可验证训练信号，对基础生成模型进行强化学习训练

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1在26个视觉理解和推理测试中超过专门训练的VLM，平均提升+5.7%；LLaVA-Critic-R1+在MMMU上达到71.9的SOTA性能；自我评价在推理任务上带来+13.8%的提升

Conclusion: 使用评分数据进行RL训练可以产生既擅长评估又擅长生成的统一模型，为可扩展自我改进的多模态系统提供简单途径

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法存在二次计算复杂度问题，难以建模长距离空间-光谱特征依赖关系。Mamba虽能解决计算负担但无法直接进行特征融合。

Method: 设计预处理模块适配Mamba结构，结合CNN提取多层特征；创新设计基于Mamba算子的跨状态模块来充分融合双模态特征；构建结合Mamba和CNN优势的更强主干网络。

Result: 在MUUFL和Houston2018两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在降低网络训练负担的前提下，性能优于Transformer方法。

Conclusion: CSFMamba网络成功利用了Mamba的低计算负担优势，探索了多模态特征融合的内部结构潜力，实现了更强的全图像理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Method: 两阶段级联Transformer：第一阶段进行掩码预训练学习通用骨架表示，第二阶段进行级联微调实现判别性动作分类

Result: 在Penn Action、N-UCLA和NTU RGB+D 60三个基准数据集上都取得了竞争性性能

Conclusion: CascadeFormer为骨架动作识别提供了有效的Transformer解决方案，并开源代码和模型检查点以促进可复现性

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管投影层在VLM架构中至关重要，但其对未见视觉概念的泛化能力尚未得到系统评估，需要建立专门的评测框架

Method: 将目标检测数据集转换为提示格式，设计标签集不相交的训练/测试分割，通过机制可解释性分析投影层的工作机制

Result: 投影层在未见类别上保持79-88%的相对性能，feed-forward网络类似键值记忆，对见过和未见标记采用相似处理方式

Conclusion: 该研究提供了新的对齐泛化评估框架，表明即使没有显式对齐监督，投影层仍具有非平凡的泛化能力，为有限对齐数据下的高效VLM训练提供了可能

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

Motivation: 深度学习在皮肤病变分类中取得了显著进展，但存在肤色相关的潜在偏见问题，影响诊断结果的公平性。由于肤色分类困难、计算需求高和公平性验证复杂，需要开发更实用的公平性算法

Method: 通过计算VGG网络卷积层和Vision Transformer中patches和heads的特征图偏度，识别并减少与肤色相关的不必要通道，专注于病变区域

Result: 该方法降低了计算成本，减少了模型偏见，同时可能减小模型大小，在保持公平性的同时提高了实际应用的可行性

Conclusion: 提出的公平性算法有效解决了皮肤病变分类中的肤色偏见问题，提供了一种不依赖传统统计方法的实用解决方案，具有更好的现实应用前景

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE方法通过有效感受野和输入归因技术，揭示了视觉SAE特征的真实因果驱动因素，而非仅仅依赖激活位置，避免了传统方法可能导致的误解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅通过检查特征激活最高的图像块来理解稀疏自编码器特征，但由于自注意力机制在整个图像中混合信息，激活块往往只是与特征触发共现而非因果驱动。需要更准确的方法来识别真正导致特征激活的图像区域。

Method: 提出因果特征解释(CaFE)方法，利用有效感受野(ERF)概念，将每个SAE特征激活视为目标，应用输入归因方法来识别因果驱动该激活的图像块。通过补丁插入测试验证方法的有效性。

Result: 在CLIP-ViT特征上，ERF映射经常与朴素激活映射不同，揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖关系。CaFE比基于激活排序的补丁方法更有效地恢复或抑制特征激活。

Conclusion: CaFE提供了更忠实和语义精确的视觉SAE特征解释，强调了仅依赖激活位置可能导致误解释的风险，为理解视觉Transformer特征提供了更可靠的因果分析方法。

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了基于自由形式标题的事件图像检索挑战，展示了语言推理与多模态检索结合在复杂现实世界图像理解中的有效性

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:

Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal

through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical

fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测变换器在HOI检测中取得了显著进展，但研究发现存在'Toxic Siblings'偏差问题——大量相似但不同的HOI三元组在交互解码器的输入和输出端相互干扰竞争，导致学习效果下降。这种偏差源于兄弟三元组/类别之间的高度混淆，相似度增加反而降低精度。

Method: 提出两种新颖的去偏学习目标：1）'contrastive-then-calibration'：从输入角度，采样兄弟类错误HOI三元组并在强位置先验指导下重构为正确三元组；2）'merge-then-split'：从输出角度，先学习兄弟类别共享特征以区别于其他组，然后显式细化组内差异以保持独特性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种设置下显著优于基线（在HICO-Det上提升9.18% mAP）和最先进方法（提升3.59% mAP）。

Conclusion: 提出的两种去偏学习目标有效解决了HOI检测中的'Toxic Siblings'偏差问题，通过输入和输出双视角的优化策略，显著提升了检测性能，为类似的多类别识别任务提供了有价值的解决方案。

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Conclusion: InterPose数据集填补了人-物交互数据空白，为人机交互、计算机图形学和机器人学提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

Motivation: 现代面部检索系统常将检索阶段外包给第三方，对用户照片隐私构成风险。同态加密虽提供强安全保障，但计算效率过低，不适合实时应用。

Method: 采用两阶段层次框架：(1)高速可取消PQ索引模块进行快速候选筛选；(2)精细化加密空间检索模块进行最终精确排名。设计了专门的保护机制来保护索引模块。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在效果、效率和安全性之间实现了良好的平衡。

Conclusion: 可取消产品量化框架为安全面部表征检索提供了高效的解决方案，有效解决了隐私保护和计算效率之间的矛盾。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is

Conclusion: 提出的图像到脑框架通过交叉注意力机制和扩散模型成功解决了视觉假体编码阶段的生物相似性问题，为生成生物可信的脑信号提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型主要关注静态场景理解，忽视了真实驾驶场景中至关重要的时间维度，这限制了自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的表现。

Method: 提出了OmniReason框架：1) 创建了两个大规模VLA数据集(OmniReason-Data)，采用幻觉缓解的自动标注流程确保物理合理性和时间一致性；2) 开发了OmniReason-Agent架构，包含稀疏时间记忆模块和解释生成器，通过时空知识蒸馏方法捕获时空因果推理模式。

Result: 在开环规划任务和视觉问答基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了时空推理能力，为复杂动态环境中的可解释自动驾驶建立了新能力。

Conclusion: OmniReason框架成功解决了自动驾驶中时空推理的关键挑战，为开发具有时间感知能力和可解释决策的自动驾驶系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

TL;DR: MI-RAG是一个多模态迭代检索增强生成框架，通过迭代检索和推理来提升知识密集型视觉问答任务的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在需要外部知识的视觉问答任务上表现有限，传统的单次检索框架往往无法获取足够的知识

Method: 提出多模态迭代RAG框架，通过累积推理记录动态生成多查询，在异构知识库中进行联合搜索，并将新知识整合到推理记录中逐步优化理解

Result: 在Encyclopedic VQA、InfoSeek和OK-VQA等挑战性基准测试中，MI-RAG显著提高了检索召回率和答案准确率

Conclusion: MI-RAG为知识密集型视觉问答中的组合推理提供了一种可扩展的方法

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Conclusion: 该方法为水下探索和海洋感知应用提供了强有力的解决方案，通过语义引导和多模态知识结合最大化了AI在水下重建中的潜力

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿超声标准平面分类面临组织对比度低、边界模糊和操作者依赖性等挑战，需要一种能够适应真实世界图像质量变化的方法。

Method: 使用浅层纹理敏感网络预测临床合理的对比度参数，通过可微分映射生成多个对比度增强视图，并在下游分类器中融合这些视图。

Conclusion: 该方法通过内容感知的自适应能力和物理信息转换，有效连接低层图像特征与高层语义，为医学图像分析建立了新范式。

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

Result: 相比之前SOTA方法，SDM表现出更强的攻击性能和更高的攻击成本效益，并能与对抗训练方法结合提升防御效果

Conclusion: SDM是一种高效且成本效益高的对抗攻击方法，能够有效评估模型鲁棒性并提升防御方法的有效性

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is
available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态3D场景重建方法通常采用两步流程，先估计相机位姿再优化3D高斯，但运动模糊会破坏位姿估计，导致误差累积和重建质量下降。

Method: 将相机和物体运动重新表述为3D高斯的每基元SE(3)仿射变换，提出统一优化目标，并采用三阶段训练策略：先固定位姿训练高斯，再固定高斯优化位姿，最后联合优化所有参数。

Result: 在Stereo Blur数据集和真实世界序列上的实验表明，该方法在重建质量和位姿估计精度方面相比现有动态去模糊方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过端到端联合优化相机位姿和3D高斯属性，有效解决了运动模糊导致的位姿估计问题，为动态3D场景重建提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解策略和关键帧锚定机制，成功解决了单视图新视角合成中的长期一致性问题，同时支持灵活的相机控制

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our

*Jiacheng Jiang,Yuan Meng,Chen Tang,Han Yu,Qun Li,Zhi Wang,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了FQAT方法，通过层间冻结机制和自适应冻结算法来解决量化感知训练中的OOD泛化性能下降问题，在I.D和OOD图像分类任务上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量化感知训练方法主要关注模型在分布内数据的性能，而忽视了在分布外数据上的性能退化问题。研究发现QAT会导致损失景观尖锐化，从而影响OOD泛化能力。

Method: 提出FQAT方法：1）引入层间冻结机制缓解双重优化目标的梯度冲突；2）设计基于梯度无序度度量的自适应冻结算法，动态确定冻结层；3）使用梯度无序度指标识别训练中的不稳定层。

Result: 在多个有影响力的OOD基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明该方法在I.D和OOD图像分类任务上都优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: FQAT方法通过关注损失景观的平坦性，有效解决了量化感知训练中的OOD泛化问题，为可泛化的量化训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

*Zirui Zhou,Zizhao Peng,Dongyang Jin,Chao Fan,Fengwei An,Shiqi Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Scoliosis1K-Pose数据集和双表征框架(DRF)，通过结合连续骨架图和离散姿态不对称向量，解决了基于姿态的脊柱侧弯筛查中的数据稀缺和噪声敏感问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI脊柱侧弯筛查方法主要依赖轮廓数据，忽略了临床相关的姿态不对称性指标。姿态数据能提供更直观的骨骼表示，但由于大规模标注数据集稀缺和原始姿态坐标的离散噪声特性，基于姿态的筛查研究不足。

Method: 1) 扩展Scoliosis1K数据集创建Scoliosis1K-Pose，包含44.79万帧2D关键点；2) 提出双表征框架(DRF)，整合连续骨架图和离散姿态不对称向量(PAV)；3) 设计PAV引导注意力模块(PGA)，利用PAV作为临床先验指导特征提取。

Result: DRF实现了最先进的性能表现。可视化证实模型能够利用临床不对称线索指导特征提取，促进双表征之间的协同作用。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了基于姿态的脊柱侧弯筛查中的关键挑战，提供了更具临床解释性的解决方案，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spotlighter是一个轻量级的token选择框架，通过评估视觉token的激活度并保留高分token，同时使用语义记忆库优化选择，在11个few-shot基准测试中显著提升了CLIP的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的成功证明了提示调优可以实现强大的跨模态语义对齐，但冗余或弱相关的特征组件会引入噪声并增加不必要的计算成本。

Method: Spotlighter从样本级和语义级两个角度评估每个视觉token的激活度，只保留得分最高的token进行下游预测。使用类别特定的语义记忆库来优化选择，并通过两级排序机制动态加权token-原型交互。

Result: 在11个few-shot基准测试中，Spotlighter比CLIP在调和平均准确率上提升了高达11.19%，同时实现了额外的0.8K FPS，仅增加了21个参数。

Conclusion: Spotlighter被证明是提示调优中一个有效且可扩展的基线方法，在提升准确率的同时显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

TL;DR: DarkVRAI是一个用于低光照RAW视频去噪的新框架，通过条件化方案和Burst-Order Selective Scan机制，在AIM 2025挑战赛中取得第一名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光照RAW视频中由于高传感器增益和短曝光时间导致的严重信号退化问题，这些限制是由视频帧率要求所固有的。

Method: 提出两个主要贡献：(1)将图像去噪的条件化方案成功应用于视频去噪，明确利用捕获元数据来指导对齐和去噪过程；(2)Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS)机制，有效建模噪声视频序列中的长程时间依赖关系。

Result: 在严格且真实的基准数据集上展示了最先进的性能，为低光照视频去噪设立了新标准。

Conclusion: 通过协同结合条件化方案和BOSS机制，DarkVRAI框架在低光照RAW视频去噪方面取得了突破性进展，赢得了AIM 2025挑战赛冠军。

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

TL;DR: LangDC是一种语言感知的动态令牌压缩器，通过轻量级语言模型生成视频片段的软描述令牌，根据语义密度动态调整压缩比例，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频令牌压缩方法采用固定压缩比例，忽略了不同视频片段语义密度的差异，导致信息丰富片段表示不足而静态片段计算浪费。

Method: 使用轻量级语言模型将视频片段转换为软描述令牌作为视觉表示，通过语义密度感知监督训练，动态调整压缩比例（描述长度反映场景丰富度）。

Result: 相比VideoGPT+减少49%的FLOPs，同时保持竞争力性能，能根据视频片段丰富度自适应调整压缩比例。

Conclusion: LangDC模拟人类动态表达视觉信息的方式，有效解决了固定压缩比例的问题，在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

TL;DR: 研究在3D高斯散射框架中集成RGB和多谱图像的最佳方法，提出联合优化策略显著提升多谱重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在3DGS框架中对多谱数据进行每波段独立优化导致几何结构不一致的问题，虽然实际几何结构相同

Method: 评估三种策略：1）单独每波段重建 2）分段优化（先RGB后其他波段） 3）联合优化策略，将多谱数据直接集成到球面谐波颜色组件中

Result: 联合优化策略显著提高了多谱重建质量，通过谱间交叉影响进一步改善了RGB结果

Conclusion: 建议在3DGS中直接将多谱数据集成到球面谐波颜色组件，并提供了优化过程中引入谱波段的关键交易选择

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雨天显著增加道路事故风险，了解驾驶员在恶劣天气条件下的视觉行为调整对于设计鲁棒的驾驶员监控系统(DMS)和高级驾驶辅助系统(ADAS)至关重要。

Method: 采用两步聚类方法分析眼动数据：首先在10秒间隔内对注视点进行聚类，然后将聚类中心聚合成元聚类，结合马尔可夫转移矩阵、注视持续时间、视线仰角和方位角分布等指标。

Result: 雨天条件下驾驶员表现出更频繁的仪表盘扫视、更长的注视持续时间、更高的视线仰角，表明认知专注度增加，但整体注视行为模式（关注道路并偶尔检查后视镜）保持一致。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了恶劣天气条件下视觉注意模式的变化，强调了利用眼动建模辅助设计更鲁棒的ADAS和DMS的潜力。

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

TL;DR: CompSlider是一种新的滑块控制方法，通过在条件先验空间中操作，实现了多个图像属性的解耦控制，避免了现有方法中多属性间的干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于滑块的文本到图像生成方法通常为每个属性单独训练适配器，忽略了多个属性之间的纠缠关系，导致不同属性间产生干扰，无法实现多个属性的精确联合控制。

Method: 提出了CompSlider方法，在T2I基础模型的条件先验空间中生成条件先验来控制多个属性。引入了新颖的解耦损失和结构损失，在组合多个属性变化的同时保持图像结构一致性。该方法在潜在空间中操作，无需重新训练基础模型。

Result: 该方法能够同时控制多个属性，实现了更可靠和独立的属性操作。在多种图像属性上进行了评估，并展示了其泛化性，可扩展到视频生成。

Conclusion: CompSlider通过解耦多属性控制，解决了现有滑块方法中的干扰问题，同时降低了训练和推理的计算负担，为细粒度图像属性控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要依赖合成数据或仅处理雨滴污染，而现实中的玻璃污染物种类更多样，需要处理更广泛的遮挡类型。

Method: 使用真实配对的污染/清洁图像数据集，提出包含自监督辅助学习任务的全能模型，通过单次测试时自适应机制针对每个测试图像的独特遮挡类型更新模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理各种现实中的玻璃污染物，通过测试时自适应机制实现了对未知污染类型的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在高级诊断任务上表现优异，但低级别图像增强（如噪声、模糊、低分辨率等问题）仍未解决。现实病理图像常因切片制备、染色变异和成像限制而存在退化，且物理染色成本高、耗时长、不一致。现有方法针对单一问题设计，缺乏处理实践中多样化低级别视觉挑战的通用性。

Conclusion: LPFM是首个能够统一处理病理图像低级别增强任务的基础模型，通过单一架构实现了多种图像恢复和虚拟染色功能，为解决病理图像处理中的多样化退化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

Motivation: 医学图像异常检测需要高效率和准确性，但CNN感受野有限，Transformer计算成本过高。Mamba的长序列处理能力和线性复杂度为此提供了新思路。

Method: 提出SpectMamba架构，包含混合空间-频率注意力块(HSFA)分离学习高低频特征，视觉状态空间模块(VSSM)增强长程依赖，以及Hilbert曲线扫描技术优化空间相关性。

Result: 在多个医学图像检测任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了高效性。

Conclusion: SpectMamba成功将Mamba架构应用于医学图像检测，解决了传统方法的局限性，为医学图像分析提供了新的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 视频扩散Transformer模型在生成高质量视频时面临计算复杂度高的问题，全注意力的二次复杂度导致训练和推理成本过高，需要解决查询和键值对的稀疏性问题

Method: BSA框架包含两个关键组件：通过语义相似性和动态时空训练策略优化查询稀疏性；通过统计动态阈值保留最显著的KV块来实现KV稀疏性

Result: BSA在长序列上显著加速DiT训练，FLOPs减少高达20倍，注意力训练速度提升17.79倍，同时保持甚至超越全注意力的生成质量

Conclusion: BSA框架有效解决了视频DiT模型的计算效率问题，为高质量视频生成提供了高效的注意力机制解决方案

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Motivation: 现有点云压缩方法通常顺序处理全局和局部信息，缺乏两者之间的有效通信，导致重建质量受限。

Method: 提出点-体素交错网络(PVINet)，包含体素编码器提取全局结构特征和点编码器建模局部上下文，引入条件稀疏卷积实现特征交互，解码时使用点嵌入指导重建。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，PVINet相比最先进方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: PVINet通过并行处理全局局部特征并实现有效交互，提升了点云压缩的重建质量。

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FICGen方法，通过频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式，解决退化场景下布局到图像生成的上下文幻觉困境，显著提升生成质量和布局对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有布局到图像生成方法在退化场景（如低光照、水下）中存在生成保真度有限和与用户提供布局对齐弱的问题，主要归因于退化条件下的"上下文幻觉困境"。

Method: 提出频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式FICGen：1）可学习的双查询机制配合频率重采样器提取上下文频率原型；2）视觉频率增强注意力注入频率原型；3）实例一致性图和自适应空间频率聚合模块实现解耦和重建。

Result: 在5个基准测试上（从严重低光照到轻度模糊等多种退化场景）的实验表明，FICGen在生成保真度、对齐度和下游辅助可训练性方面 consistently超越现有L2I方法。

Conclusion: FICGen通过将退化图像的频率知识转移到潜在扩散空间，有效解决了退化场景中的上下文幻觉问题，为布局到图像生成在挑战性环境中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSToken是一种基于高斯参数化的空间自适应图像标记化框架，使用2D高斯分布动态建模不同图像区域的位置、形状和纹理，实现非均匀图像分割和高效特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均匀网格的标记化方法无法灵活表示不同形状、纹理和位置的图像区域，限制了特征表示的有效性。

Method: 采用熵驱动算法将图像分割为纹理均匀区域，每个区域用2D高斯分布（均值表示位置，协方差表示形状）和纹理特征参数化，通过专用transformer优化高斯参数，使用可微分渲染器重建特征图。

Result: 在图像重建和生成任务中，使用128个token实现了rFID 0.65和FID 1.50的state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: GPSToken通过解耦空间布局和纹理特征，实现了高效的两阶段生成，在图像表示和生成方面表现出优异性能。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

Conclusion: MetaSSL是一个即插即用的通用框架，能够有效提升半监督医学图像分割的性能，通过同时利用不确定性和一致性信息来优化损失函数设计。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Motivation: 现有的结简端到端多视角行人跟踪方法仅使用当前和单个过去时间戳的信息，忽略了更早期的踪迹信息，导致关联准确性不足。

Method: 提出MVTrajecter方法，引入踪迹运动成本和踪迹外观成本来有效结合运动和外观信息，并利用注意机制捕捉多时间戳间的关系。

Result: 实验结果显示MVTrajecter每个组件都有效，且性能超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MVTrajecter通过利用多时间戳踪迹信息实现了更稳健的行人关联，为多视角跟踪领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

<details>

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型依赖视觉-语言编码器进行关键帧采样，但这些编码器是否能真正识别出最具信息量的帧尚不清楚，需要验证其有效性。

Method: 通过实证研究分析流行视觉编码器在识别关键帧方面的能力，检验它们是否能准确定位MLLM应该关注视频中的哪些部分来处理给定的文本查询。

Result: 研究发现现有视觉编码器在识别关键帧方面存在严重局限性，无法有效识别出最信息丰富的帧，这限制了视频MLLM的效率。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的关键帧识别技术来提高视频多模态大语言模型的效率，当前视觉编码器的局限性表明现有方法存在改进空间。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

TL;DR: DynaMind是一个从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景的新框架，通过联合建模神经动力学和语义特征，在视频重建准确性和视觉保真度方面实现了显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景时面临空间分辨率低、时间不匹配和语义信息利用不足的问题，无法充分解析视觉刺激的动态连贯性和复杂语义上下文

Method: 提出DynaMind框架，包含三个核心模块：区域感知语义映射器(RSM)提取多模态语义特征，时间感知动态对齐器(TDA)生成动态潜在序列确保时间一致性，双引导视频重建器(DGVR)将时序蓝图转换为高保真视频

Result: 在SEED-DV数据集上达到新的SOTA水平，视频和帧级准确率分别提升12.5和10.3个百分点，SSIM提升9.4%，FVMD降低19.7%，显示出卓越的视觉保真度和时间连贯性

Conclusion: 这项研究标志着神经动力学与高保真视觉语义之间差距的关键性进展，为脑解码领域提供了重要突破

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解属性泄漏问题，在不同生成场景中保持优异的主体保真度，推动了可控多主体图像合成的前沿发展

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Conclusion: SegAssess通过PQM范式为无监督分割质量评估提供了全面、像素级且可迁移的解决方案，在遥感图像分析中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and

realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRINTER是一个弱监督框架，通过原型驱动的内容-染色模式解耦和形变感知对抗学习，解决H&E和IHC连续切片空间错位问题，实现准确的虚拟染色。


<details>

Motivation: 当前方法在连续切片中存在空间错位问题，严重影响病理学原位解释的准确性，需要更精确的虚拟染色模式来关联H&E形态学和IHC生物标志物表达。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1）原型驱动的染色模式转移与显式内容-风格解耦；2）循环注册-合成框架GapBridge通过可变形结构对齐桥接H&E和IHC域；3）形变感知对抗学习，生成器和形变感知注册网络联合对抗优化风格聚焦判别器。

Conclusion: 该工作为虚拟染色提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，推动了计算病理学领域的发展。

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Conclusion: 该框架能够在不依赖手动标注或温雨技术的情况下，通过自动化流程构建高性能文档提取模型，有效解决了复杂文档格式处理的挑战

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

Motivation: 现有单视图自监督学习方法主要关注从可见点恢复被遮挡点，而双视图预训练范式能提供更大的多样性和方差，从而可能实现更具挑战性和信息量的预训练

Method: 提出跨重建生成范式：首先生成两个解耦的点云视图，然后从一个视图重建另一个视图。开发了点云视图生成的裁剪机制和新的位置编码来表示两个视图之间的3D相对位置

Result: 在ScanObjectNN的三个变体上，使用Mlp-Linear评估协议，比自重建基线(Point-MAE)分别提升了6.5%、7.0%和6.7%

Conclusion: 双视图交叉重建相比单模态自重建方法显著提高了预训练难度，在3D自监督学习领域取得了更好的性能表现

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

Motivation: 传统图像字幕系统往往产生通用描述，无法捕捉事件级别的语义信息，这在新闻报道和数字存档等应用中至关重要。现有视觉语言模型通常只关注可见内容，而忽略了时间、社会和历史背景。

Method: ReCap包含三个集成组件：(1)使用DINOv2嵌入的两阶段文章检索系统，先通过全局特征相似性选择候选，再用补丁级互近邻相似性重新排序；(2)从文章摘要、通用字幕和原始元数据中合成信息的上下文提取框架；(3)基于大语言模型的字幕生成系统，采用语义高斯归一化来增强流畅性和相关性。

Result: 在EVENTA 2025大挑战赛Track 1的OpenEvents V1数据集上评估，ReCap获得了0.54666的总体得分，在私有测试集上排名第二。

Conclusion: ReCap有效弥合了视觉感知与现实世界知识之间的差距，为高风险领域中的上下文感知图像理解提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1

strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter

Conclusion: FSS-TIs通过ODE框架将域无关特征表示空间的探索和多样化目标域分布的模拟重新表述为ODE内在参数的优化过程，提供了结构简洁且有效的跨域少样本分割解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

Result: 实验表明该方法在分割性能上可与使用高分辨率、昂贵的64通道激光雷达数据的模型相媲美

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了低成本传感器性能受限的问题，为自动驾驶中的大规模3D语义分割部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges: detecting small, dense, and
overlapping objects (a major hurdle in computer vision) and improving the
quality of noisy images, especially those encountered in industrial
environments. [1, 2]. Our focus is on evaluating methods built on supervised
deep learning. We perform an analysis of these methods, using a newly de-
veloped dataset comprising over 10k images and 120k in- stances. By evaluating
their performance, accuracy, and com- putational efficiency, we identify the
most reliable detection systems and highlight the specific challenges they
address in industrial applications. This paper also examines the use of deep
learning models to improve image quality in noisy industrial environments. We
introduce a lightweight model based on a fully connected convolutional network.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的街景图像地理定位方法，通过整合开源多模态大语言模型和检索增强生成技术，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，且无需昂贵的微调或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体数据和智能手机摄像头的普及，传统计算机视觉技术在图像定位方面面临挑战，但具有重要应用价值，如导航、位置推荐和城市规划等。

Method: 使用SigLIP编码器在两个大规模数据集(EMP-16和OSV-5M)上构建向量数据库，通过检索增强生成技术，在查询图像中加入相似和不相似的地理位置信息提示，然后由多模态大语言模型处理。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准数据集(IM2GPS、IM2GPS3k和YFCC4k)上实现了更高的准确率，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了检索增强生成多模态大语言模型在地理定位估计中的有效性，为传统从零开始训练模型的方法提供了替代路径，为GeoAI领域提供了更易获取和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Conclusion: AgroSense为精准农业提供了实用、可扩展的实时决策支持解决方案，为资源受限环境中的轻量级多模态AI系统开辟了道路。

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了M3Ret统一视觉编码器，通过自监督学习在包含2D、3D和视频的多模态医学图像数据集上训练，实现了跨模态的零样本检索，并在未见过的MRI任务上表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法针对不同模态使用分离的架构和训练策略，这种模态特定的设计限制了可扩展性，阻碍了统一表示的发展。需要开发能够处理多种医学图像模态的统一模型。

Method: 构建包含867,653个医学图像样本的大规模混合模态数据集，包括2D X射线、超声、RGB内窥镜视频和3D CT扫描。使用生成式(MAE)和对比式(SimDINO)自监督学习范式训练M3Ret统一视觉编码器，无需任何模态特定的定制。

Result: 在所有单个模态的零样本图像到图像检索中达到新的最先进水平，超越了DINOv3和BMC-CLIP等强基线。在没有配对数据的情况下实现了强大的跨模态对齐，并且在从未见过的MRI任务上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: M3Ret展示了纯视觉自监督学习对未见模态的泛化能力，为医学成像社区提供了一个有前景的信号，是迈向多模态医学图像理解基础模型的重要一步。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的文本到视频生成框架TPIGE，通过提示词增强、参考图像增强和时空引导增强，在保持身份一致性的同时提升视频质量，在ACM Multimedia 2025挑战赛中取得第一名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的身份保持文本到视频生成方法需要大量ID匹配数据进行微调，面临数据稀缺和高昂调优成本的问题，需要一种更高效的无训练解决方案。

Method: 1) 使用GPT-4o进行面部感知提示增强，从参考图像提取面部细节丰富文本提示；2) 使用身份保持图像生成器进行提示感知参考图像增强，修正与文本提示的冲突；3) 提出ID感知时空引导增强，在生成过程中联合优化身份保持和视频质量。

Result: 在1000个视频测试集上通过自动和人工评估验证，方法优于先前工作，在ACM Multimedia 2025身份保持视频生成挑战赛中获得第一名，展现了最先进的性能和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TPIGE框架通过输入增强和采样引导的协同作用，以最小成本实现了身份保持文本到视频生成的性能提升，为数据稀缺场景下的高质量视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了可转向摄像头带来的动态场景分析挑战，为智能交通控制和人群监控等服务提供了更高效的实时视频分析解决方案

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Abstract: Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform
illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose
three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust
24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: RAL框架通过概率建模和置信门控来解决部分相关视频检索中的不确定性挑战，提升跨模态对齐的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分相关视频检索面临查询歧义和视频片段部分相关性的数据不确定性挑战，现有方法容易受到干扰视频的虚假相似性影响

Method: 提出RAL框架：1）将视频和查询编码为多元高斯分布进行概率建模；2）引入可学习的置信门控动态加权相似度

Result: 在多种检索骨干网络上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: RAL作为即插即用解决方案，能够有效处理PRVR中的数据不确定性，提升检索性能

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: RibPull是一种利用隐式占用场连接计算几何和医学成像的方法，通过神经占用场表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩提取中轴，相比体素网格在稀疏数据处理和几何操作方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体素网格在医学成像中存在分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题，而隐式3D表示能更好地处理稀疏噪声数据并保留复杂几何信息。

Method: 使用神经占用场预测3D点是否在物体内部来表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩提取胸腔的中轴，展示了基于连续坐标的3D场景表示的优势。

Result: 在RibSeg数据集的20个医学扫描上进行了评估，证明了该方法在稀疏信号补偿和几何操作方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于连续坐标的隐式3D表示比传统的体素网格更适合医学成像中的稀疏数据处理和复杂几何操作，代码将在发表后发布。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法主要关注语义控制，往往忽视了保持风格一致性的关键任务，这影响了图像的整体美感和连贯性。

Method: 提出神经场景设计器(NSD)框架，采用双并行交叉注意力机制分别处理文本和风格信息，并设计了渐进式自风格表示学习(PSRL)模块，通过风格对比损失来学习细粒度风格表示。

Result: 在建立的综合基准测试上进行大量实验，证明了所提出框架的有效性，能够实现照片级真实的区域操作，同时保持语义对齐和风格一致性。

Conclusion: NSD框架成功解决了图像编辑中的风格一致性问题，通过创新的注意力机制和风格学习模块，为图像编辑任务提供了新的解决方案，并建立了标准化的评估基准。

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统图像质量评估方法需要大量人工标注数据的问题，以及现有指标在感知对齐和计算效率方面的不足

Method: 使用伪MOS监督训练，通过可复现的失真处理和多个质量指标集成来生成训练数据，结合空间掩蔽和课程学习策略进行感知优化

Result: 在标准FR-IQA基准测试中超越现有指标，推理速度快适合实时应用，在去噪、超分辨率和人脸修复等任务中显著提升性能并减少计算开销

Conclusion: MILO不仅是一个先进的图像质量评估指标，还可作为生成管道中感知优化的实用工具，在图像和潜在空间都表现出色

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Conclusion: 本研究成功开发了一种专门针对孟加拉街头美食的高精度自动卡路里追踪系统，充分解决了现有方法在多种食物识别、图像处理和文化适配性方面的局限性，为实际应用提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

TL;DR: PointSlice是一种新颖的点云处理方法，通过将3D点云水平切片为多组2D数据，结合切片交互网络(SIN)保持垂直关系，在保持高精度的同时显著提升推理速度和减少参数数量。

Motivation: 解决现有体素方法精度高但推理慢、柱状方法速度快但精度不足的问题，寻求在自动驾驶3D目标检测中实现精度与速度的平衡。

Method: 提出PointSlice方法：1) 将3D点云沿水平面切片转换为多组2D数据，模型仅学习2D分布；2) 引入切片交互网络(SIN)保持切片间垂直关系，增强3D感知能力。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上比SAFDNet快1.13倍，参数减少0.79倍，精度仅下降1.2 mAPH；在nuScenes数据集达到66.74 mAP的SOTA结果；在Argoverse 2数据集快1.10倍，参数减少0.66倍，精度下降1.0 mAP。

Conclusion: PointSlice通过创新的点云切片处理和SIN网络，成功实现了3D目标检测中精度与效率的良好平衡，为自动驾驶应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展的3D形状生成提供了一个实用框架，实现了高几何保真度的快速生成。

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Motivation: nnUNet框架虽然能自动调整训练超参数，但忽略了分割网络内部超参数的调优，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 设计了自适应卷积模块，根据数据集特征动态调整卷积核大小，并集成到MSConvBridge和MSADecoder两个关键组件中，分别用于优化跳跃连接和解码过程。

Result: 在Synapse、ACDC、Kvasir和ISIC2017四个数据集上分别获得了86.49%、92.56%、93.37%和92.98%的Dice系数。

Conclusion: MSA2-Net通过自适应的卷积核调整机制，在多种医学图像分割任务中表现出强大的鲁棒性和精确性。

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff能够实时去噪HIFU干扰，提高HIFU治疗的精确度，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM提供了一个高效且通用的视觉SLAM解决方案，无需相机内参知识，在保持轻量级设计的同时实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

TL;DR: O-DisCo-Edit是一个统一的视频编辑框架，通过创新的对象失真控制信号和复制形式保护模块，实现了高效高质量的多任务视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在视频编辑中面临挑战，需要为不同编辑任务设计不同的控制信号，导致模型设计复杂且训练资源需求大。

Method: 提出O-DisCo-Edit框架，包含基于随机和自适应噪声的对象失真控制信号，以及用于保护未编辑区域的复制形式保护模块。

Result: 大量实验和人工评估表明，O-DisCo-Edit在各种视频编辑任务中均优于专业和多任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个统一的解决方案，能够灵活封装多种编辑线索，实现高效高保真度的视频编辑。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的立体视觉Transformer模型，用于同时从两个角度分割导管并估计其尖端3D力，在合成X射线图像上优于现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务深度学习模型通过CNN编码器-解码器架构处理导管手术中的触觉和视觉感知，但需要逐步扩展感受野。本文从新视角出发，旨在利用Transformer捕获长距离依赖关系，无需逐步扩展感受野。

Method: 提出基于Vision Transformer的编码器-解码器模型，将两个输入X射线图像作为独立序列处理。编码器和解码器生成的嵌入分别输入两个共享分割头，回归头使用解码器融合信息进行3D力估计。

Result: 在具有不同噪声水平的合成X射线图像上进行了广泛实验，与最先进的分割模型、视觉导管力估计方法以及多任务方法进行比较，在导管分割和力估计两方面都达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 提出的立体视觉Transformer模型能够有效捕获X射线图像间的长距离依赖关系，在导管分割和3D力估计任务上均优于现有方法，为导管手术提供了更准确的感知数据。

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

TL;DR: 通过Panel-of-Peers学习框架，利用多个LVLM模型组成小组进行迭代自我改进，避免了人工标注或机器生成偏好数据的成本和质量问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统对齐方法依赖人工精选偏好数据成本高，机器生成数据质量有限，自监督偏好数据容易引入幻觉的问题

Method: 受人类协作学习启发，构建一个由多个LVLM模型组成的小组，通过模拟同行评审系统进行迭代的输出生成、评估和精炼，精选提示集模拟教室学习环境

Result: 在十五个测试集上平均分数从48%提升到57%，显著提升模型性能且无需大量人工标签数据

Conclusion: Panel-of-Peers学习框架作为一种可扩展的自监督对齐替代方案具有强大潜力，通过同行评估实现了无需人工偏好数据的模型自我改进

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

*Natalia Frumkin,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Sched是一种新的后训练量化方法，通过调整扩散模型调度器而非模型权重，在4倍模型压缩下实现全精度准确率，显著提升few-step扩散模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型计算成本高昂，few-step方法虽然减少了去噪步骤但仍依赖大型未压缩模型，传统后训练量化方法需要全精度校准，限制了在资源受限设备上的部署。

Method: 提出Q-Sched范式，通过修改扩散模型调度器来调整few-step采样轨迹；设计JAQ损失函数，结合文本-图像兼容性和图像质量指标，无需参考图像和全精度推理即可进行细粒度优化。

Result: 相比FP16 4步潜在一致性模型提升15.5% FID，相比FP16 8步分阶段一致性模型提升16.6% FID；在FLUX.1和SDXL-Turbo上的大规模用户研究（8万+标注）证实了有效性。

Conclusion: 量化与few-step蒸馏在高保真生成中具有互补性，Q-Sched为资源受限环境下的高效扩散模型推理提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

TL;DR: OpenVision 2通过移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅保留生成式标题损失，显著提升了训练效率和可扩展性，同时保持了与原模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化OpenVision架构和损失设计，提升训练效率，减少计算资源和内存消耗，同时探索纯生成式训练范式在视觉-语言预训练中的潜力。

Method: 移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅使用标题生成损失作为纯生成式训练信号，保持视觉编码器和生成组件的核心架构。

Result: 训练时间减少1.5倍（83小时→57小时），内存使用减少1.8倍（24.5GB→13.8GB），批次大小从2k增至8k，参数规模可扩展至10亿以上，在多模态基准测试中性能与原模型相当。

Conclusion: 轻量级的纯生成式训练范式具有显著优势，为多模态基础模型中视觉编码器的未来发展提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Conclusion: 通过强化学习有效提升了多模态LLM的视觉工具使用能力，为RL-based视觉工具使用提供了新的见解

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the
instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the
community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and

Method: 使用ResNet50和DINOv2架构，在分类器前加入可选的PCA步骤将数据降至3维，采用三层分类器进行多标签分类

Result: PCA的有效性强烈依赖于所选的深度学习架构和训练策略，不同架构对PCA的响应不同

Conclusion: 研究为自监督预训练和替代降维方法的未来研究开辟了道路，需要根据具体架构选择是否使用PCA

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures

Motivation: 有限角度CT虽然能提高时间分辨率和减少辐射剂量，但由于投影截断会产生严重伪影，需要解决其病态重建问题

Method: 两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段使用基于transformer的扩散模型仅根据元数据生成粗略解剖先验；第二阶段整合粗略先验和元数据生成高保真结果，每个采样步骤都通过ADMM模块强制执行基于物理的数据一致性

Result: 在合成和真实心脏CT数据集上的实验表明，加入元数据显著提高了重建保真度，特别是在严重角度截断情况下，在SSIM、PSNR、nMI和PCC指标上优于现有无元数据基线

Conclusion: 临床元数据在提高重建质量和效率方面具有双重作用，不同类型的元数据提供互补优势，支持将其整合到未来的元数据引导医学成像框架中

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Motivation: 实际视觉识别中的数据通常具有长尾分布特征，这给深度神经网络的高效训练和部署带来挑战。信息瓶颈(IB)方法在表征学习中很有效，但需要适应长尾数据特性。

Method: 提出平衡信息瓶颈(BIB)，将损失函数重新平衡和自我蓬涩技术集成到原始IB网络中。进一步提出多重平衡信息瓶颈(MBIB)结构，不同BIB负责结合不同网络层的知识。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

Motivation: 现有光照控制方法需要大量领域特定数据集训练，限制了基础模型的泛化能力和适用性。需要一种更实用、通用的方法来控制生成图像中的光照。

Method: 基于光照关系与自注意力层中token交互相似的洞察，训练轻量级LoRA回归器生成直接辐照度图，利用早期扩散迭代的重要性，通过分类器引导将目标光照融入图像生成过程。

Conclusion: 通过挖掘基础模型的知识，图像光照控制是可行的，实现了实用且通用的重光照功能，为图像生成中的光照控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

Motivation: 当前基于计算机视觉的空间转录组学分析方法严重受限于数据丢失问题，现有方法依赖单细胞RNA测序参考，存在对齐质量依赖、外部数据集依赖、批次效应和继承性数据丢失等局限。

Method: 提出LGDiST模型，采用无参考的潜在基因扩散方法，利用之前被认为无信息的上下文基因构建丰富且具有生物学意义的遗传潜在空间，包含上下文基因、ST潜在空间和邻居条件等关键组件。

Result: 在26个数据集上平均MSE降低18%，在6种最先进方法上基因表达预测性能提升高达10%（MSE指标）。移除关键组件会导致性能显著下降。

Conclusion: LGDiST的完整架构相比其孤立组件实现了显著更好的性能，证明了该方法在处理空间转录组学数据丢失问题上的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

TL;DR: 本文首次对CAV中基于联邦学习的物体检测进行了全面的部署导向评估，分析了检测精度、计算成本和资源使用之间的权衡关系。


<details>

Motivation: 集中式训练在可扩展性、适应性和隐私保护方面存在不足，而联邦学习虽然能实现分布式协作训练，但在实际CAV部署中面临计算需求高、环境多变等挑战。

Method: 使用YOLOv5、YOLOv8、YOLOv11和Deformable DETR等先进检测器，在KITTI、BDD100K和nuScenes数据集上进行评估，分析不同分辨率、批次大小、天气光照条件和动态客户端参与下的性能表现。

Conclusion: 这项工作为CAV中联邦学习物体检测的实际部署提供了关键见解和评估框架，解决了数据异构性、硬件约束和环境变化等核心挑战。

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

Conclusion: 该研究开发了一种可立即部署、灵活且可解释的工作流程，避免了监督学习的需求，显著加快了灾后响应人员的分流和优先级判断。

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets
lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While
single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture
dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the
Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods,
wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging
the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust
training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware
bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate
detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate,
interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

Conclusion: 这是首个将可解释性引入地理定位的工作，通过概念瓶颈实现了更好的对齐性能和模型解释能力

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，该方法在定量指标和感知质量方面都达到了有竞争力的性能

Conclusion: 为将高斯泼溅技术应用于2D图像处理开辟了新方向，证明了其在图像修复任务中的有效性

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

Conclusion: MOSAIC通过表示层面的精确语义对齐和正交特征解耦，为复杂多主体合成应用开辟了新可能性，解决了多主体生成中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

### [173] [Draw-In-Mind: Learning Precise Image Editing via Chain-of-Thought Imagination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01986)
*Ziyun Zeng,Junhao Zhang,Wei Li,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Draw-In-Mind (DIM)数据集和模型，通过将设计责任明确分配给理解模块来解决多模态统一模型中图像编辑精度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态统一模型在文本到图像生成方面表现良好，但在精确图像编辑方面仍有困难，主要原因是理解模块和生成模块之间的责任分配不平衡。理解模块仅作为翻译器，而生成模块需要同时承担设计师和画家的角色。

Method: 构建DIM数据集，包含两个子集：DIM-T2I（1400万长上下文图像-文本对）和DIM-Edit（23.3万GPT-4o生成的思维链想象）。通过两层MLP连接冻结的Qwen2.5-VL-3B和可训练的SANA1.5-1.6B，在DIM数据集上训练得到DIM-4.6B模型。

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit在ImgEdit和GEdit-Bench基准测试中达到SOTA或竞争性性能，超越了UniWorld-V1和Step1X-Edit等更大的模型。

Conclusion: 将设计责任明确分配给理解模块能显著提升图像编辑性能，证明了该方法在有限参数量下实现高效图像编辑的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous
driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and
methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of
more interpretable AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Palette-Adapter是一种新颖的方法，通过将调色板解释为稀疏直方图并引入两个标量控制参数（直方图熵和调色板到直方图距离），来稳定地控制文本到图像扩散模型中的颜色调色板条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调色板在创意工作流程中广泛使用，但在图像生成中作为条件使用时存在显著的模糊性和不稳定性，需要一种能够灵活控制调色板遵循度和颜色变化的方法。

Method: 将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，引入直方图熵和调色板到直方图距离两个控制参数，使用负直方图机制抑制不需要的色调，并在精心策划的数据集上进行训练以确保颜色空间的广泛泛化。

Result: 该方法在定性、定量和用户研究中一致优于现有方法，在实现强调色板遵循度和高图像质量方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter提供了一种稳定、语义连贯的图像生成方法，能够在广泛的调色板和提示范围内实现精确的颜色控制。

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于视觉的边缘计算框架，用于无侵入地监测早产儿的行为状态，在保持高准确度的同时实现低成本部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源环境中早产儿监测的挑战，避免传统手工观察或侵入式传感器带来的错误和皮肤损伤问题。

Method: 使用量化的MobileNet模型在Raspberry Pi上部署实时行为状态检测系统，集成了模型量化、设备优化视觉管道和安全IoT通信等技术。

Result: 系统在公开数据集上达到了状态质准确度（89.8%睡眠检测和97.7%哭哭/正常分类），模型大小减少68%，适合边缘部署。

Conclusion: 轻量级优化模型如MobileNet是建立可扩展、低成本的NICU监测系统的最佳选择，为资源突出环境提供了可行的早产儿护理解决方案。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

Motivation: 尽管RMOT系统在语言-视觉理解方面取得进展，但其可靠性和鲁棒性研究不足。本文从设计逻辑角度分析RMOT系统的安全漏洞，特别是FIFO内存机制中的时空推理漏洞。

Method: 提出VEIL对抗攻击框架，针对RMOT系统的语言-视觉引用和跟踪对象匹配组件进行攻击，利用FIFO内存的持续性漏洞在多个后续帧中保持攻击效果。

Result: 在Refer-KITTI数据集上的综合评估验证了VEIL的有效性，能够导致跟踪ID切换和终止，破坏跟踪逻辑的可靠性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RMOT系统存在严重的安全漏洞，强调了在关键大规模应用中需要安全感知的RMOT设计的紧迫性。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的slot attention方法，通过ContextFusion阶段和Bootstrap Branch解决了现有方法缺乏高级语义信息和无法微调编码器的问题，在多个数据集上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有slot attention方法存在两个主要问题：(1)缺乏高级语义信息，仅依赖低级特征如颜色和纹理；(2)无法微调编码器，限制了学习灵活性。

Method: 提出ContextFusion阶段利用前景和背景的语义信息，加入辅助指标以提供更多上下文线索；设计Bootstrap Branch将特征适应与重建阶段解耦，通过自助策略训练特征适应机制。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界数据集上，新方法显著提升了多个独立的SOTA slot attention模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了slot attention在语义信息和编码器适应性方面的限制，为物体中心学习领域提供了更灵活和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

Motivation: 现有表面异常检测方法擅长检测结构异常（如凹痕、划痕），但在逻辑异常（如不规则或缺失的物体组件）检测上表现不佳。现有最佳方法依赖聚合预训练特征或手工描述符，丢弃了空间和语义信息。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，包含新设计的组成分支来显式建模对象组成图的分布，学习重要语义关系。同时引入无需手工标签或类别特定信息的组成图提取新流程。

Result: 在标准逻辑异常检测基准MVTec LOCO上显著优于最先进方法，达到96.1%的图像级AUROC。

Conclusion: 通过有效建模组成图分布，SALAD方法在逻辑异常检测方面取得了显著改进，证明了语义感知方法的重要性。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Conclusion: GRPO方法的有效性得到验证，为全景场景理解建立了新的基准，推动了跨帧相关全景图理解技术的发展。

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

TL;DR: RocketScience是一个开源的对比视觉语言模型基准测试，专门测试空间关系理解能力，包含全新的真实世界图像-文本对，主要涵盖相对空间理解和物体顺序。该基准对人类来说很简单，但对当前VLM模型来说很难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间关系理解方面存在明显不足，需要专门的基准测试来评估和改进这一能力。

Method: 创建包含全新真实世界图像-文本对的数据集，主要测试相对空间关系和物体顺序理解。进行解耦分析以分离物体定位和空间推理的贡献。

Result: 结果显示开源和前沿商业VLM在空间关系理解方面表现显著不足，而推理模型表现意外地好。性能瓶颈在于空间推理能力而非物体定位能力。

Conclusion: RocketScience基准揭示了当前VLM在空间理解方面的重大缺陷，为改进模型的空间推理能力提供了重要工具和洞见。

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的基于轨迹的测试时间适配(TTA)数据集ITD，用于模拟实际环境中的时间依赖性挑战，并提出了一种对抗性内存初始化策略来改善内存基TTA方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的TTA测试数据集缺乏对实际场景中自然存在的时间依赖性的模拟，如视频流中连续帧之间的相关性。这个缺陷导致对TTA方法在真实环境中表现的评估不准确。

Method: 通过从物体跟踪数据集的边框中收集物体中心图片序列来构建ITD数据集，使其自然体现时间依赖性。同时提出了一种新的对抗性内存初始化策略来改善内存基TTA方法。

Result: 使用ITD数据集进行了完整的实验分析，发现当前TTA方法在面对时间依赖性挑战时存在限制。新的对抗性内存初始化策略在这个具有挑战性的测试集上显著提升了各种方法的性能。

Conclusion: ITD数据集有效地模拟了真实环境中的时间依赖性挑战，为TTA方法提供了更准确的评估。提出的对抗性内存初始化策略为改善内存基TTA方法的性能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

Abstract: Neck pain is the primary symptom of cervical spondylosis, yet its underlying

the challenges of multimodal feature fusion caused by imaging differences and

(FPRAN) to mitigate structural misalignment. Experiments on the MMCSD dataset
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior prediction accuracy of
postoperative neck pain recovery compared with existing methods, and ablation

Method: 提出双流图卷积网络(DSGC-Net)，包含密度近似(DA)分支和表示近似(RA)分支。DA分支构建密度驱动的语义图，RA分支构建表示驱动的语义图，分别应用图卷积网络建模潜在语义关系。

Conclusion: DSGC-Net通过挖掘特征相关性有效提升了模型对密度变化的适应能力和多视角多姿态场景下的计数精度，为复杂人群计数提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法主要针对自然图像，不适用于遥感图像的数据稀缺、多尺度场景结构和明显分布偏移等挑战。

Method: 提出空间特征增强提升场景判别能力，双提示对齐机制交叉验证场景上下文与细粒度语义的空间语义一致性，置信度引导自训练循环动态挖掘伪标签扩展训练数据。

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中一致优于现有方法，能够以最少标注数据实现高效适应。

Conclusion: 空间语义集成对于遥感OOD检测具有关键价值，RS-OOD框架有效解决了遥感图像的特殊挑战。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on
real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在空间推理任务上表现不佳，特别是在处理物体之间的空间关系时。现有方法通过模型微调或使用手工制作的损失函数进行测试时优化，但这些方法不够优化。

Method: 提出了Learn-to-Steer框架，训练一个轻量级分类器从扩散模型的交叉注意力图中解码空间关系，然后在推理时将该分类器作为学习到的损失函数部署。使用双重反转策略来强制几何理解，避免分类器仅检测语言痕迹。

Conclusion: 通过直接从模型内部表示学习目标而不是手工制作损失函数，可以显著改善文本到图像扩散模型的空间推理能力，该方法具有很好的泛化性和效果。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序数图像分类中类别边界模糊，标注过程容易产生噪声标签，这会显著降低机器学习模型的性能和可靠性

Method: 提出ORDAC方法，利用标签分布学习(LDL)建模序数标签的模糊性和不确定性，在训练过程中动态调整每个样本标签分布的均值和标准差，校正而非丢弃噪声样本

Result: 在Adience数据集上，40%噪声情况下ORDAC_R将平均绝对误差从0.86降至0.62，召回率从0.37提升至0.49，在原始数据集的内在噪声校正中也表现有效

Conclusion: 使用标签分布进行自适应标签校正是提高序数分类模型在噪声数据下鲁棒性和准确性的有效策略

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

TL;DR: MedDINOv3是一个将DINOv3基础模型适配到医学图像分割的框架，通过多尺度token聚合架构和领域自适应预训练，在多个分割基准测试中达到或超越最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学CT和MRI扫描中器官和肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习模型缺乏跨模态和跨机构的泛化能力，而视觉基础模型在医学图像上存在性能不足和领域差距大的问题

Method: 首先重新设计简单有效的多尺度token聚合架构，然后在包含387万张CT切片的CT-3M数据集上进行多阶段DINOv3领域自适应预训练，学习鲁棒的密集特征

Result: MedDINOv3在四个分割基准测试中匹配或超越了最先进的性能，证明了视觉基础模型作为医学图像分割统一骨干网络的潜力

Conclusion: 该研究成功地将视觉基础模型适配到医学图像分割领域，为解决医学图像分割的泛化性问题提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

TL;DR: DBStereo是一个基于纯2D卷积的4D成本聚合网络，通过解耦学习实现实时性能和高精度，超越了现有基于聚合的方法，甚至超过了基于迭代的方法IGEV-Stereo。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高性能实时立体匹配方法依赖3D成本体积正则化，这对移动设备不友好；而基于2D正则化的方法在不适定区域表现不佳。

Method: 提出轻量级双向几何聚合块，分别捕获空间和视差表示，通过解耦学习实现4D成本体积的有效处理。

Result: 在推理时间和准确性方面都优于所有现有的基于聚合的方法，甚至超过了基于迭代的方法IGEV-Stereo。

Conclusion: 打破了使用3D卷积处理4D成本体积的经验设计，为解耦聚合范式提供了一个简单而强大的基线。

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a
simple yet strong baseline of the proposed decouple aggregation paradigm for
further study. Code will be available at

TL;DR: GSD-Net是一个几何-结构双引导网络，通过整合几何和结构线索来提高医学图像分割在噪声标注下的鲁棒性，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大规模高质量标注，但专家标注存在主观性和粗糙标注带来的噪声，这会破坏特征学习并影响模型性能。

Method: 提出GSD-Net网络，包含几何距离感知模块（动态调整像素级权重）、结构引导标签精炼模块（利用结构先验精炼标签）和知识转移模块（丰富监督并提高局部细节敏感性）。

Result: 在6个公开数据集上评估，包含3种模拟标签噪声和真实多专家标注。在Kvasir、Shenzhen、BU-SUC和BraTS2020数据集上分别提升2.52%、22.76%、8.87%和4.59%。

Conclusion: GSD-Net在噪声标注下表现出色，有效提高了医学图像分割的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of
this study are available at https://github.com/ortonwang/GSD-Net.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的协作蒸馏和自学习框架，用于红外和可见光图像融合，通过智能体动态调整训练策略和学生自学习，实现轻量级高质量图像融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外和可见光图像融合在场景感知中至关重要，但现有方法难以在轻量级模型中实现高质量融合，需要新的方法来提升学生模型性能。

Method: 采用强化学习驱动的协作蒸馏框架，智能体根据学生表现和师生差距生成挑战性样本供学生自学习，并动态调整教师指导强度来优化知识传递。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能显著提升学生模型性能，相比现有技术获得更好的融合效果。

Conclusion: 该框架通过强化学习智能体有效协调师生协作和自学习过程，为轻量级图像融合模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

TL;DR: 一种新的实时虚拟化妆试用框架，通过透明化妆面具提取和渲染分离，实现高保真度、身份保持的美妆转移，具有稳定的时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分离半透明化妆与皮肤颜色时遇到困难，导致身份偏移和公平性问题，且缺乏实时能力和时间一致性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将化妆转移解耦为两步：透明化妆面具提取和图形学面具渲染。使用伪真实数据训练提取模型，包括图形渲染流程和无监督k-means聚类方法。提出专门的训练目标，如alpha权重重建和唇彩损失。

Result: 方法在多样化姿势、表情和皮肤颜色下实现了稳健的化妆转移，保持时间平滑性。实验表明该方法在抓取细节、维持时间稳定性和保持身份完整性方面超过现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了实时虚拟化妆试用中的关键挑战，实现了高保真度、身份保持和时间一致的美妆转移，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Motivation: 现有低分辨率卫星数据难以准确监测狭窄或泥沙含量高的河流，需要高分辨率数据来支持精细尺度的水文建模和水资源管理。

Method: 通过计算机科学与水文学专家合作，手动标注1145张高分辨率图像的水体掩膜，并与Sentinel-2、SWOT等传感器数据配准，评估多种深度学习架构和预训练策略。

Conclusion: RiverScope为精细尺度和多传感器水文建模提供了宝贵资源，支持气候适应和可持续水资源管理。

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Conclusion: 提出的生成式视频合成方法能够自动化传统视频制作流程，为用户提供灵活的交互式定制能力，显著提升视频制作效率。

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models.Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation.Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over previous
text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective evaluation.

Motivation: 医学影像中复杂器官形状和各向异性的高维图像特性使得传统位置编码方法表现不佳，需要专门针对医学影像特点设计的位置编码方案。

Method: 提出了各向异性傅里叶特征位置编码(AFPE)，这是对等向性傅里叶特征位置编码的泛化，能够结合各向异性、类别特定和领域特定的空间依赖关系。

Result: 在胸部X光多标签分类、CT器官分类和超声心动图射血分数回归等任务中，AFPE在所有测试的各向异性设置中都显著优于最先进的位置编码方法。

Conclusion: 在各向异性的医学图像和视频中，选择适合数据和目标形状的各向异性位置编码至关重要，AFPE为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

Conclusion: MDM-MixMFL框架能够有效处理混合模态联邦学习中的异质性问题，为分布式医疗场景下的MRI图像分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

Motivation: 现有的无监督多目标发现方法虽然利用物体中心学习和视频运动线索，但仍需要监督生成伪标签来训练模型，存在监督依赖的局限性。

Method: 扩展自监督预训练模型DINOSAUR，通过检索无相机运动的视频帧进行无监督光流运动分割生成高质量伪标签，使用这些标签精炼slot表示并训练slot停用模块来区分前景和背景。

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR证明了即使概念简单，通过运动精炼和完全无监督的方法也能在多目标发现任务中取得优异性能，为无监督视觉理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

Conclusion: 证明token合并技术是建立可扩展3D视觉系统的理论基础解决方案，FastVGGT在保持强大重建能力的同时显著提高了效率

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.
