### [1] [ESCA: Contextualizing Embodied Agents via Scene-Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15963)
*Jiani Huang,Amish Sethi,Matthew Kuo,Mayank Keoliya,Neelay Velingker,JungHo Jung,Ser-Nam Lim,Ziyang Li,Mayur Naik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ESCA框架和SGClip模型，通过结构化时空理解来增强多模态大语言模型，无需人工标注即可生成场景图，显著提升了智能体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型主要依赖高级视觉-声音-文本对，缺乏像素级视觉内容与文本语义之间的细粒度结构化对齐，这限制了智能体的感知能力。

Method: 提出ESCA框架，核心是SGClip模型——基于CLIP的可提示场景图生成模型，通过神经符号学习在87K+开放域视频上进行训练，利用模型驱动的自监督和结构化推理。

Result: SGClip在场景图生成和动作定位基准测试中表现优异，ESCA框架持续改进开源和商业MLLMs，在两个具身环境中达到最先进性能，显著减少感知错误并使开源模型超越专有基线。

Conclusion: ESCA框架通过结构化空间-时间理解有效提升了多模态大语言模型的性能，证明了无需人工标注的场景图生成方法在增强智能体感知能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward
general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily
rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured
alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome
this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied
agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is
SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating
scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic
learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from
video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for
human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both
prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph
generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently
improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces
agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary
baselines.

### [2] [CrossRay3D: Geometry and Distribution Guidance for Efficient Multimodal 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15991)
*Huiming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CrossRay3D稀疏多模态检测器，通过Ray-Aware监督和Class-Balanced监督提升token表示质量，在nuScenes基准上达到72.4 mAP和74.7 NDS的SOTA性能，比现有方法快1.84倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏检测器忽视token表示质量，导致前景质量不优和性能受限。本文发现几何结构保持和类别分布是提升稀疏检测器性能的关键。

Method: 提出Sparse Selector(SS)，核心模块包括：Ray-Aware Supervision(RAS)保持训练阶段的几何信息，Class-Balanced Supervision自适应重加权类别语义显著性，以及Ray Positional Encoding(Ray PE)解决LiDAR和图像模态间的分布差异。

Result: 在nuScenes基准上达到72.4 mAP和74.7 NDS的SOTA性能，运行速度比其他领先方法快1.84倍，且在LiDAR或相机数据部分或完全缺失的场景下表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrossRay3D通过改进token表示质量，在稀疏多模态检测中实现了卓越的性能和效率，证明了几何结构保持和类别平衡监督的重要性。

Abstract: The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its
counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of
adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However,
existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving
it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this
paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class
distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector,
and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware
Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the
training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the
salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects
are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse
multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design
Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences
between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the
aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed
CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark,
CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS,
while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D
demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are
partially or entirely missing.

### [3] [InfraGPT Smart Infrastructure: An End-to-End VLM-Based Framework for Detecting and Managing Urban Defects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16017)
*Ibrahim Sheikh Mohamed,Abdullah Yahya Abdullah Omaisan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个利用街景CCTV监控流进行多缺陷检测和分割的完整管道，结合YOLO目标检测器和视觉语言模型，生成结构化维护行动计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智慧城市基础设施监控需求增长，人工检查成本高且危险，现有自动系统通常只能处理单一缺陷类型或输出非结构化结果，无法直接指导维护工作。

Method: 使用YOLO系列目标检测器进行多缺陷检测和分割，然后将检测结果传递给视觉语言模型进行场景感知总结，生成包含事件描述、推荐工具、尺寸、维修计划和紧急警报的JSON格式结构化行动计划。

Result: 在公共数据集和捕获的CCTV片段上的实验评估表明，系统能准确识别多种缺陷并生成连贯的总结。

Conclusion: 讨论了将系统扩展到城市范围部署的挑战和方向。

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of
closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop
cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require
timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing
automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide
unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper
proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi
defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and
passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware
summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that
includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans,
and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection,
highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and
LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation
on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system
accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We
conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city
wide deployments.

### [4] [IAD-GPT: Advancing Visual Knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Model for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16036)
*Zewen Li,Zitong Yu,Qilang Ye,Weicheng Xie,Wei Zhuo,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAD-GPT是一个基于多模态大语言模型的工业异常检测新范式，通过异常提示生成器、文本引导增强器和多掩码融合模块，结合文本语义与图像信息实现先进的异常检测和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业异常检测方法缺乏多轮人机对话和详细描述能力，而基于大模型的方法尚未充分激发其在异常检测任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用异常提示生成器生成详细异常提示，通过文本引导增强器增强视觉定位能力，并设计多掩码融合模块整合掩码作为专家知识。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法在自监督和少样本异常检测与分割任务中的最先进性能。

Conclusion: IAD-GPT成功结合了多模态大语言模型的因果推理能力与工业异常检测需求，提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold
the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection
(IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide
multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color
of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the
same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated
the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we
explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and
pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based
on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate
detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the
large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation
functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the
visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein
image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically
select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific
aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and
respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion
module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's
perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and
few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets. The codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种放射学报告模式（自由文本、结构化报告、AI辅助结构化报告）对图像分析行为、诊断准确性、效率和用户体验的影响。结果显示AI辅助结构化报告在诊断准确性和效率方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索结构化报告和人工智能如何改变放射科医生与影像研究的交互方式，评估不同报告模式对诊断工作流程的影响。

Method: 前瞻性研究，8名读者（4名新手和4名非新手）使用定制查看器和眼动追踪系统分析35张床旁胸片。比较三种报告模式：自由文本、结构化报告和AI辅助结构化报告。

Result: AI辅助结构化报告的诊断准确性最高（κ=0.71），报告时间最短（25±9秒），眼动指标显示视觉注意力更集中于图像区域。新手读者在结构化报告中将视线转向图像，而非新手读者保持对图像的专注。

Conclusion: 结构化报告通过引导视觉注意力朝向图像来提高效率，而AI预填充的结构化报告进一步提升了诊断准确性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how
radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to
December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT),
structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on
image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.
Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students)
each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized
viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy
(compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per
radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience.
Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni
post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy
was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in
AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$
s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade
counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm
58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s
(FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P <
.001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while
non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the
preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual
attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic
accuracy and user satisfaction.

### [6] [Data-Driven Analysis of Intersectional Bias in Image Classification: A Framework with Bias-Weighted Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16072)
*Farjana Yesmin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个数据驱动的框架IFEF来分析图像分类中的交叉偏见，并开发了BWA数据增强方法来缓解这些偏见，在Open Images V7数据集上显著提高了少数群体子组的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非平衡数据集上训练的机器学习模型经常表现出交叉偏见——由多个属性（如物体类别和环境条件）相互作用产生的系统性错误。

Method: 引入交叉公平性评估框架(IFEF)结合定量公平性指标和可解释性工具，并提出基于子组分布统计的自适应数据增强策略BWA。

Result: 在Open Images V7数据集上，BWA将代表性不足的类别-环境交叉子组的准确率提高了24个百分点，公平性指标差异减少了35%，统计显著性得到确认(p < 0.05)。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析和解决图像分类系统中的交叉偏见提供了一个可复现的途径。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit
intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of
multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This
paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases
in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation
Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with
interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model
predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation
(BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation
intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open
Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves
accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24
percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%.
Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance
of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for
analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

### [7] [Differentiable, Bit-shifting, and Scalable Quantization without training neural network from scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16088)
*Zia Badar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可微分且收敛的神经网络量化方法，支持多比特对数量化，在ImageNet数据集上使用ResNet18进行权重量化时，仅需15个训练周期就能达到与全精度模型相差不到1%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法存在两个主要问题：一是大多使用不可微分方法，在反向传播中手动设置导数，影响学习能力；二是移位/对数量化方法要么避免激活量化，要么准确率较低。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出可微分的量化方法，支持多比特对数量化（形式为2^n），提供收敛性证明，支持权重和激活的同时量化。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，仅权重量化时准确率与全精度模型相差不到1%；权重和激活同时量化时达到SOTA水平，仅需15个训练周期，推理成本略高于1比特量化但无需高精度乘法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可微分、收敛且高效的多比特量化方案，在保持高准确率的同时显著降低了计算和内存需求。

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less
compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two
important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in
quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the
derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning
ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we
also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural
network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have
avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less
accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the
quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is
another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as
well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet
dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent
accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to
train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches
accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit
quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu
instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic
quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了StripRFNet网络用于道路损伤检测，通过形状感知、条状感受野和小尺度增强三个模块，在RDD2022基准测试中实现了最先进的精度和实时效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路表面损伤威胁交通安全并阻碍可持续城市发展，但准确检测面临损伤形状多样、细长裂缝难以捕捉和小尺度损伤识别错误率高等挑战。

Method: StripRFNet包含三个模块：形状感知模块(SPM)通过大分离核注意力增强形状判别；条状感受野模块(SRFM)使用大条状卷积和池化捕捉细长裂缝特征；小尺度增强模块(SSEM)利用高分辨率P2特征图、专用检测头和动态上采样改进小目标检测。

Result: 在RDD2022基准测试中，中国子集的F1分数、mAP50和mAP50:95分别比基线提高4.4、2.9和3.4个百分点；完整数据集上达到80.33%的最高F1分数，同时保持有竞争力的推理速度。

Conclusion: StripRFNet实现了最先进的精度和实时效率，为智能道路维护和可持续基础设施管理提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Well-maintained road networks are crucial for achieving Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 11. Road surface damage not only threatens traffic
safety but also hinders sustainable urban development. Accurate detection,
however, remains challenging due to the diverse shapes of damages, the
difficulty of capturing slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and the high
error rates in small-scale damage recognition. To address these issues, we
propose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a
Shape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large
separable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a
Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and
pooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale
Enhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a
dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object
detection. Experiments on the RDD2022 benchmark show that StripRFNet surpasses
existing methods. On the Chinese subset, it improves F1-score, mAP50, and
mAP50:95 by 4.4, 2.9, and 3.4 percentage points over the baseline,
respectively. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33%
compared with CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while
maintaining competitive inference speed. These results demonstrate that
StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time efficiency,
offering a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable
infrastructure management.

### [9] [ObjectTransforms for Uncertainty Quantification and Reduction in Vision-Based Perception for Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16118)
*Nishad Sahu,Shounak Sural,Aditya Satish Patil,Ragunathan,Rajkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ObjectTransforms是一种通过对象特定变换来量化和减少视觉目标检测中不确定性的技术，在训练和推理时分别使用颜色空间扰动和扩散模型生成，通过检测分数的方差来量化预测不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中可靠的感知对安全决策至关重要，但基于视觉的目标检测神经网络容易受到数据偏差和分布偏移等不确定性因素的影响。

Method: 在训练时对单个对象进行颜色空间扰动，并使用扩散模型生成多样化的行人实例；在推理时对检测到的对象应用扰动，利用检测分数的方差来实时量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在NuImages 10K数据集上的YOLOv8实验显示，该方法在所有目标类别上都带来了显著的准确性提升和不确定性减少，在推理时对假阳性预测了比真阳性更高的不确定性值。

Conclusion: ObjectTransforms作为一种轻量级但有效的机制，在训练和推理时分别具有减少和量化视觉感知不确定性的潜力。

Abstract: Reliable perception is fundamental for safety critical decision making in
autonomous driving. Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain
vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and
distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a
technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object
detection through object specific transformations at both training and
inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space
perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color
variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic,
diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are
applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to
quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then
used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving
the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K
dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and
uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while
predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared
to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of
ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and
quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and
inference respectively.

*Sayan Deb Sarkar,Sinisa Stekovic,Vincent Lepetit,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过引导预训练的整流流模型来将外观（图像或文本）转移到3D资产上，解决了几何形状差异大的情况下的外观转移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在输入和外观对象的几何形状显著不同时效果不佳，直接应用3D生成模型无法产生有吸引力的结果。

Method: 使用预训练的整流流模型，在采样过程中定期添加可微分损失函数的引导，包括部分感知损失和自相似性损失。

Result: 方法成功将纹理和几何细节转移到3D资产，在定性和定量上都优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可扩展到不同类型的扩散模型和引导函数，并通过GPT-based系统客观评估外观转移质量。

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the
appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its
wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and
digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the
geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A
straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we
show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we
propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a
pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free
method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.
This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we
experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for
appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach
successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,
outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show
that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their
inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in
absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with
a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like
assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios,
our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion
models and guidance functions.

Abstract: Thrombectomy is one of the most effective treatments for ischemic stroke, but
it is resource and personnel-intensive. We propose employing deep learning to
automate critical aspects of thrombectomy, thereby enhancing efficiency and
safety. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised framework that classifies
various skeletal landmarks using a regression-based pretext task. Our
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both
regression and classification tasks. Notably, our results indicate that the
positional pretext task significantly enhances downstream classification
performance. Future work will focus on extending this framework toward fully
autonomous C-arm control, aiming to optimize trajectories from the pelvis to
the head during stroke thrombectomy procedures. All code used is available at

TL;DR: 提出DuetMatch，一种用于医学图像分割的双分支半监督框架，通过异步优化和多种正则化技术提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注数据有限，半监督学习具有吸引力。但现有教师-学生框架联合优化整个网络会阻碍收敛和稳定性

Method: 使用双分支异步优化（每个分支只优化编码器或解码器），引入解耦丢弃扰动、成对CutMix交叉引导和一致性匹配等技术

Result: 在ISLES2022和BraTS等脑MRI分割数据集上，DuetMatch持续优于最先进方法

Conclusion: DuetMatch在多样半监督分割场景中展现出有效性和鲁棒性

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data in medical imaging makes
semi-supervised learning increasingly appealing for its ability to learn from
imperfect supervision. Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained
popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly
optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially
in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we
propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with
asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or
decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy
conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing
regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance
to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input
pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose
Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen
teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation
datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and
robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自主导航C臂到预定义解剖标志的管道，利用X射线图像预测3D位移向量，并捕获不确定性以确保可靠部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床工作流程依赖手动对齐C臂，这会增加辐射暴露和手术延迟，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和安全性。

Method: 使用X射线图像预测3D位移向量，结合概率损失和骨骼姿态正则化训练模型，并使用保形预测校准不确定性。

Result: 在DeepDRR生成的合成X射线数据集上验证，显示出强大的定位准确性和良好校准的预测边界。

Conclusion: 该管道有潜力成为安全可靠自主C臂系统的组成部分，能够减少辐射暴露并提高手术效率。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable C-arm positioning is essential for fluoroscopy-guided
interventions. However, clinical workflows rely on manual alignment that
increases radiation exposure and procedural delays. In this work, we present a
pipeline that autonomously navigates the C-arm to predefined anatomical
landmarks utilizing X-ray images. Given an input X-ray image from an arbitrary
starting location on the operating table, the model predicts a 3D displacement
vector toward each target landmark along the body. To ensure reliable
deployment, we capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the
model's predictions and further calibrate them using conformal prediction. The
derived prediction regions are interpreted as 3D confidence regions around the
predicted landmark locations. The training framework combines a probabilistic
loss with skeletal pose regularization to encourage anatomically plausible
outputs. We validate our approach on a synthetic X-ray dataset generated from
DeepDRR. Results show not only strong localization accuracy across multiple
architectures but also well-calibrated prediction bounds. These findings
highlight the pipeline's potential as a component in safe and reliable
autonomous C-arm systems. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一个公式来估计图像质量评估(IQA)引擎的成本节省，并在背景修复用例中展示了51.61%的成本节省


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型生成的图像质量仍不如传统摄影方法，需要人工IQA评估，这个过程耗时且昂贵

Method: 开发了一个公式来估计基于IQA引擎精度和通过率的成本节省，并使用AutoML解决方案进行验证

Result: 在背景修复用例中实现了51.61%的成本节省

Conclusion: 自动IQA预过滤可以显著降低获取高质量图像的平均成本

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown impressive progress in recent years, making
it possible to produce high quality images with a simple text prompt or a
reference image. However, state of the art technology does not yet meet the
quality standards offered by traditional photographic methods. For this reason,
production pipelines that use generated images often include a manual stage of
image quality assessment (IQA). This process is slow and expensive, especially
because of the low yield of automatically generated images that pass the
quality bar. The IQA workload can be reduced by introducing an automatic
pre-filtering stage, that will increase the overall quality of the images sent
to review and, therefore, reduce the average cost required to obtain a high
quality image. We present a formula that estimates the cost savings depending
on the precision and pass yield of a generic IQA engine. This formula is
applied in a use case of background inpainting, showcasing a significant cost
saving of 51.61% obtained with a simple AutoML solution.

<details>

Motivation: 理解大脑如何编码视觉信息是神经科学和机器学习的重要挑战。当前从fMRI信号重建图像的方法依赖于将信号转换为潜在空间，但哪种潜在空间最适合这种转换以及如何有效组织仍不明确。

Method: 提出PRISM模型：1）将fMRI信号投影到结构化文本空间；2）包含以对象为中心的扩散模块，通过组合单个对象生成图像以减少对象检测错误；3）属性关系搜索模块自动识别与神经活动最匹配的关键属性和关系。

Conclusion: 使用结构化文本作为中间空间来桥接fMRI信号和图像重建具有重要意义，fMRI信号与文本空间的相似性为视觉信息解码提供了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge
in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct
visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a
latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct
images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is
to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces
images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best
supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual
stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more
similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based
space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the
generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of
visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and
relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that
Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate
representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric
diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to
reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module
that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align
with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an
8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of
using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and
image reconstruction.

*Nyle Siddiqui,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为StretchySnake的灵活训练方法，通过动态调整时空分辨率来增强状态空间模型在视频理解中的适应性，解决了传统方法在未见时空分辨率下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解训练方法主要针对transformer设计，未能充分利用状态空间模型的独特优势。固定分辨率和视频长度的训练导致模型在面对不同时空分辨率视频时性能下降，限制了模型在长短视频中的表现能力。

Method: 提出灵活训练方法，在训练过程中采样不同时空分辨率的视频，并动态插值模型权重以适应任意时空尺度。比较了五种不同的灵活训练变体，确定了最适合视频状态空间模型的策略。

Result: 在短动作（UCF-101、HMDB-51）和长动作（COIN、Breakfast）基准测试中，StretchySnake比transformer和状态空间模型基线提升了高达28%，在细粒度动作（SSV2、Diving-48）上表现出强大的适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单的即插即用训练方案，使视频状态空间模型在各种动作识别场景中更加鲁棒、分辨率无关且高效。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to
transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state
recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences,
whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training
methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to
fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are
often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic
scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models
suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and
temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal
inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a
model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos.
Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves
the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying
temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates
model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM,
which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to
seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long,
complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of
flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On
short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks,
StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%,
with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore,
our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more
robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition
scenarios.

Motivation: 传统CNN难以捕捉全局面部特征，Vision Transformer能建模长距离空间关系但计算复杂度高，需要结合两种模型的互补优势。

Method: 使用异构集成架构，ViT主干捕捉全局面部结构和对称性，Mamba主干以线性复杂度建模长距离依赖关系，关注序列特征和纹理。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500数据集上取得PC 0.9212、MAE 0.2085、RMSE 0.2698的SOTA性能，并通过Grad-CAM可视化验证了两个主干网络的互补特征提取。

Conclusion: VM-BeautyNet为计算美学提供了强大的新架构范式，通过融合ViT和Mamba的互补优势，有效提升了面部美颜预测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a complex and challenging computer vision
task, aiming to model the subjective and intricate nature of human aesthetic
perception. While deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), have made significant strides, they often struggle to capture
the global, holistic facial features that are critical to human judgment.
Vision Transformers (ViT) address this by effectively modeling long-range
spatial relationships, but their quadratic complexity can be a bottleneck. This
paper introduces a novel, heterogeneous ensemble architecture,
\textbf{VM-BeautyNet}, that synergistically fuses the complementary strengths
of a Vision Transformer and a Mamba-based Vision model, a recent advancement in
State-Space Models (SSMs). The ViT backbone excels at capturing global facial
structure and symmetry, while the Mamba backbone efficiently models long-range
dependencies with linear complexity, focusing on sequential features and
textures. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark SCUT-FBP5500 dataset. Our
proposed VM-BeautyNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
\textbf{Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9212}, a \textbf{Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.2085}, and a \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2698}.
Furthermore, through Grad-CAM visualizations, we provide interpretability
analysis that confirms the complementary feature extraction of the two
backbones, offering new insights into the model's decision-making process and
presenting a powerful new architectural paradigm for computational aesthetics.

Motivation: OCSCC是头颈部最常见的癌症，早期症状不明显且生长缓慢，常被忽视导致可预防的死亡。利用CNN的精确图像分割和模式识别能力可以早期检测OCSCC。

Method: 训练CNN使用4293张训练图像（良性/恶性肿瘤和阴性样本），评估精度、召回率和mAP。测试数据集包含不同分辨率的图像，使用设计的增强硬件采集详细图像，并开发应用程序进行测试。

Result: 图像分辨率增加时，预测准确性呈对数增长，表明更高像素数带来的收益递减。

Conclusion: CNN结合图像采集硬件可以有效检测OCSCC，图像分辨率对准确性有重要影响，但存在收益递减现象。

Abstract: Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) is the most common type of head
and neck cancer. Due to the subtle nature of its early stages, deep and hidden
areas of development, and slow growth, OCSCC often goes undetected, leading to
preventable deaths. However, properly trained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), with their precise image segmentation techniques and ability to apply
kernel matrices to modify the RGB values of images for accurate image pattern
recognition, would be an effective means for early detection of OCSCC. Pairing
this neural network with image capturing and processing hardware would allow
increased efficacy in OCSCC detection. The aim of our project is to develop a
Convolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a
physical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to
determine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was
trained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as
well as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean
Average Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of
randomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was
chosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test
data set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the
basis of accuracy. The designed enhancement hardware was used to capture
detailed images, and its impact was scored. An application was developed to
facilitate the testing process and bring open access to the CNN. Images of
increasing resolution resulted in higher-accuracy predictions on a logarithmic
scale, demonstrating the diminishing returns of higher pixel counts.

Conclusion: 通过人-物交互线索的主动场景分解与重建方法，为动态环境提供了一种灵活渐进的重建替代方案，能够有效解决静态重建中的模糊性问题。

Abstract: Human behaviors are the major causes of scene dynamics and inherently contain
rich cues regarding the dynamics. This paper formalizes a new task of proactive
scene decomposition and reconstruction, an online approach that leverages
human-object interactions to iteratively disassemble and reconstruct the
environment. By observing these intentional interactions, we can dynamically
refine the decomposition and reconstruction process, addressing inherent
ambiguities in static object-level reconstruction. The proposed system
effectively integrates multiple tasks in dynamic environments such as accurate
camera and object pose estimation, instance decomposition, and online map
updating, capitalizing on cues from human-object interactions in egocentric
live streams for a flexible, progressive alternative to conventional
object-level reconstruction methods. Aided by the Gaussian splatting technique,
accurate and consistent dynamic scene modeling is achieved with photorealistic
and efficient rendering. The efficacy is validated in multiple real-world
scenarios with promising advantages.

Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的视频异常检测方法虽然具有优秀的零样本检测能力，但计算成本巨大且视觉定位性能不稳定，阻碍了实时部署。

Method: 采用两级级联系统：离线学习正常行为规则，在线推理时结合轻量级过滤和细粒度VLM推理。关键创新包括运动掩码提示和基于规则的偏差检测。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估显示，Cerberus在NVIDIA L40S GPU上平均达到57.68 fps，速度提升151.79倍，准确率达到97.2%，与最先进的VLM-based VAD方法相当。

Conclusion: Cerberus为实时视频分析提供了一个实用的解决方案，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了检测速度。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot
detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual
grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for
efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules
offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning
during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key
innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The
former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the
latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than
enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show
that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a
151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art
VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time

Motivation: 解决现有成员推理攻击评估中存在的分布偏差问题，提供更准确、无偏见的基准来评估LVLMs的隐私保护能力。

Method: 构建包含6,000张图像的受控基准，精心平衡成员和非成员样本的分布，并在三个不同训练阶段提供真实成员标签。

Result: 在无偏条件下，最先进的MIA方法性能收敛到随机猜测水平，表明之前的高成功率主要源于数据集偏差。

Conclusion: OpenLVLM-MIA为LVLMs的MIA研究提供了透明无偏的基准，澄清了当前方法的局限性，为开发更强的隐私保护技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in
evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language
models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our
analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional
bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true
membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark
of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are
carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across
three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated
that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance
under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark,
OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and
provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving
techniques.

Abstract: Generating sketches guided by reference styles requires precise transfer of
stroke attributes, such as line thickness, deformation, and texture sparsity,
while preserving semantic structure and content fidelity. To this end, we
propose Stroke2Sketch, a novel training-free framework that introduces
cross-image stroke attention, a mechanism embedded within self-attention layers
to establish fine-grained semantic correspondences and enable accurate stroke
attribute transfer. This allows our method to adaptively integrate reference
stroke characteristics into content images while maintaining structural
integrity. Additionally, we develop adaptive contrast enhancement and
semantic-focused attention to reinforce content preservation and foreground
emphasis. Stroke2Sketch effectively synthesizes stylistically faithful sketches
that closely resemble handcrafted results, outperforming existing methods in
expressive stroke control and semantic coherence. Codes are available at

Motivation: 由于现有数据集无法满足研究规模需求，需要构建大规模数据集来系统分析深度伪造检测任务的缩放规律，以应对不断演进的深度伪造技术。

Method: 构建了ScaleDF数据集（包含580万张来自51个域的真实图像和880万张由102种深度伪造方法生成的假图像），并分析模型性能与真实域数量、深度伪造方法数量和训练图像数量的关系。

Conclusion: 缩放定律为深度伪造检测提供了数据中心的应对策略，同时研究了预训练和数据增强在缩放中的作用以及缩放本身的局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake
detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the
number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images.
Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we
construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains
over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than
8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we
observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows a predictable
power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake
methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the
number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach a
target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake
technology in a data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of
pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as
well as the limitations of scaling itself.

remain constrained to sub-$1K \times 1K$ resolutions due to the prohibitive
quadratic complexity of attention and the scarcity of native $4K$ training
data. We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces
hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling
efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high
resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size
local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear,
while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects
global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local
pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To
maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve
order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in
a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT
achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared
to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$
resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both
quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons,
Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching
or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training.
Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with
guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for
advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型生成过程计算密集、用户需要多次迭代优化提示词导致延迟增加和云资源负担重的问题

Method: 提出云边协同框架，设备端使用轻量扩散模型快速生成预览，云端使用高容量模型进行最终优化，并引入噪声水平预测器动态平衡计算负载

Result: 相比Stable Diffusion v1.5减少15.8%的平均生成时间，保持可比图像质量；相比Tiny-SD仅慢0.9%但图像质量显著提升

Conclusion: DiffusionX在最小开销下展示了效率和可扩展性，有效平衡了延迟和云工作负载

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have driven remarkable progress in image
generation. However, the generation process remains computationally intensive,
and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired
results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud
resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge
collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In
this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by
rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs
final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise
level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the
trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX
reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5,
while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower
than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating
efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了TokenAR框架，通过token级增强机制解决多参考图像生成中的身份混淆问题，包含token索引嵌入、指令token注入和身份token解缠策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归模型在多参考图像生成中难以解耦不同参考身份，存在身份混淆问题。

Method: TokenAR框架包含三个部分：1) Token Index Embedding聚类token索引以更好表示相同参考图像；2) Instruct Token Injection作为额外视觉特征容器注入详细和互补的先验；3) 身份token解缠策略(ITD)显式引导token表示独立表示每个身份的特征。

Result: 该方法显著增强了现有基于AR的方法在条件图像生成中的能力，在保持高质量背景重建的同时实现了良好的身份一致性。在多个参考图像生成任务中超越了当前最先进模型。

Conclusion: TokenAR框架通过token级增强有效解决了多参考图像生成中的身份混淆问题，并引入了首个开源的大规模多参考输入数据集InstructAR Dataset。

Abstract: Autoregressive Model (AR) has shown remarkable success in conditional image
generation. However, these approaches for multiple reference generation
struggle with decoupling different reference identities. In this work, we
propose the TokenAR framework, specifically focused on a simple but effective
token-level enhancement mechanism to address reference identity confusion
problem. Such token-level enhancement consists of three parts, 1). Token Index
Embedding clusters the tokens index for better representing the same reference
images; 2). Instruct Token Injection plays as a role of extra visual feature
container to inject detailed and complementary priors for reference tokens; 3).
The identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) explicitly guides the token
representations toward independently representing the features of each
identity.This token-enhancement framework significantly augments the
capabilities of existing AR based methods in conditional image generation,
enabling good identity consistency while preserving high quality background
reconstruction. Driven by the goal of high-quality and high-diversity in
multi-subject generation, we introduce the InstructAR Dataset, the first
open-source, large-scale, multi-reference input, open domain image generation
dataset that includes 28K training pairs, each example has two reference
subjects, a relative prompt and a background with mask annotation, curated for
multiple reference image generation training and evaluating. Comprehensive
experiments validate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art
models in multiple reference image generation task. The implementation code and
datasets will be made publicly. Codes are available, see

*Junha Song,Sangdoo Yun,Dongyoon Han,Jaegul Choo,Byeongho Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了多模态语言模型(MLLM)性能主要继承自LLM骨干的假设，发现训练策略(特别是强化学习RL)会重塑视觉编码器，提出了PIVOT方法来高效构建更强的视觉编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究过度关注LLM骨干而忽视了视觉编码器的作用，特别是在从监督微调(SFT)转向强化学习(RL)的训练范式转变中，缺乏对视觉编码器如何被重塑的分析。

Method: 通过多样化的实验分析视觉编码器，包括ImageNet分类、分割和梯度可视化，并提出了PIVOT方法(偏好指导的视觉优化)来构建更强的视觉编码器。

Result: RL相比SFT能产生更强且更精确定位的视觉表示，PIVOT训练的视觉编码器性能超过更大、训练更重的对手，且计算成本不到标准视觉预训练的1%。

Conclusion: 训练策略不仅影响MLLM下游任务表现，还从根本上重塑视觉表示，PIVOT为MLLM视觉骨干的发展提供了高效有效的路径。

Abstract: A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that
its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense
parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the
understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive
images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning
(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the
significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder
as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of
training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in
strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a
critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through
diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and
segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's
post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on
MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual
representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces
stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,
boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our
findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,
Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,
a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained
counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of
standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path
for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted
Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the
discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due
to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies
in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images
of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are
predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP;
however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical
foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework,
termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong
empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun
based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy
between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output.
Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability
of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes
existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself.
Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the
state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了首个面向社交制造场景的异常检测基准数据集MIRAD，该数据集捕捉了个性化产品多样性、分布式制造节点和成像异质性三个关键维度。在MIRAD上评估现有SOTA方法发现性能显著下降，揭示了现实世界个性化生产中缺陷检测的未解决复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交制造模式通过社区协作和分散资源实现大规模个性化生产，但这也带来了质量控制方面的重大挑战，特别是在缺陷检测方面。主要困难来自三个方面：产品配置高度定制化、生产涉及碎片化小批量订单、分布式站点的成像环境差异显著。

Method: 引入Mass Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD)数据集，这是首个专门为社交制造异常检测设计的基准。MIRAD捕捉了三个关键维度：具有大类内变异的多样化个性化产品、来自六个地理分散制造节点的数据、以及包括光照、背景和运动条件变化在内的显著成像异质性。

Result: 在MIRAD上对最先进的异常检测方法进行了广泛评估，涵盖单类、多类和零样本方法。结果显示，与传统基准相比，所有模型的性能都显著下降，突显了现实世界个性化生产中缺陷检测的未解决复杂性。

Conclusion: 通过弥合工业需求和学术研究，MIRAD为开发工业5.0所需的稳健质量控制解决方案提供了现实基础。该数据集已在https://github.com/wu33learn/MIRAD公开提供。

Abstract: Social manufacturing leverages community collaboration and scattered
resources to realize mass individualization in modern industry. However, this
paradigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control,
particularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three
aspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second,
production typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging
environments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the
scarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass
Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first
benchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing,
MIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse
individualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected
from six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial
imaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion
conditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and
zero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all
models compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved
complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. By
bridging industrial requirements and academic research, MIRAD provides a
realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions essential
for Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available at

Conclusion: Demeter为植物建模提供了强大的参数化表示，在作物植物建模方面具有重要应用价值，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Learning 3D parametric shape models of objects has gained popularity in
vision and graphics and has showed broad utility in 3D reconstruction,
generation, understanding, and simulation. While powerful models exist for
humans and animals, equally expressive approaches for modeling plants are
lacking. In this work, we present Demeter, a data-driven parametric model that
encodes key factors of a plant morphology, including topology, shape,
articulation, and deformation into a compact learned representation. Unlike
previous parametric models, Demeter handles varying shape topology across
various species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation,
subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To advance crop plant
modeling, we collected a large-scale, ground-truthed dataset from a soybean
farm as a testbed. Experiments show that Demeter effectively synthesizes
shapes, reconstructs structures, and simulates biophysical processes. Code and

Result: 在Raspberry Pi 5上实现2.98倍加速，端到端效率提升42%，解码帧率提升3.1倍，精度损失极小（PA-MPJPE仅从9.0mm增至9.1mm）。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持与最先进方法相当精度的同时，显著提升了计算效率，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep
learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices
require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many
framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance.
We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and
introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and
accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the
inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency
improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture
significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry
Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we
apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving
accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on
FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5
CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor). Our method is also evaluated on
compound benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable accuracy to

Abstract: Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object
grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D
segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based
instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack
intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an
innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based
segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform
segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on
their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for
MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM
can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel
Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views
are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization,
aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several
close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained
local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive
experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting
both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly
introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly
supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal,
replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and
versatility. Project page: https://ChangyueShi.github.io/REALM.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉中心任务中往往过度依赖语言先验，或在推理中使用文本捷径，而强化学习在VLM中的应用因缺乏可扩展可靠的奖励机制而受阻。

Method: 将自监督学习目标（如图像旋转预测、掩码补丁重建）重新表述为密集、自动的奖励信号，用于RL微调。

Result: SSL4RL显著提升了视觉中心和视觉语言推理基准的性能，并在图学习中也取得了显著收益。

Conclusion: SSL4RL建立了一个使用可验证自监督目标对齐多模态模型的通用有效范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating
large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize
visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in
vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning.
Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors,
its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable
reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel
framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of
verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL
objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked
patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human
preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL
substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language
reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify
key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with
the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering
new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's
generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains.
SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal
models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

Conclusion: LightGlueStick通过轻量化架构和创新的ALMP机制，成功实现了高效的点和线段联合匹配，适用于实时应用和边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Lines and points are complementary local features, whose combination has
proven effective for applications such as SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. The
backbone of these pipelines are the local feature matchers, establishing
correspondences across images. Traditionally, point and line matching have been
treated as independent tasks. Recently, GlueStick proposed a GNN-based network
that simultaneously operates on points and lines to establish matches. While
running a single joint matching reduced the overall computational complexity,
the heavy architecture prevented real-time applications or deployment to edge
devices.
  Inspired by recent progress in point matching, we propose LightGlueStick, a
lightweight matcher for points and line segments. The key novel component in
our architecture is the Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP), which
explicitly exposes the connectivity of the lines to the network, allowing for
efficient communication between nodes. In thorough experiments we show that
LightGlueStick establishes a new state-of-the-art across different benchmarks.

Conclusion: 相比之前的深度伪造视频检测方法，EDVD-LLaMA提供了更可解释且更优的解决方案，代码和数据集将公开可用。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated
artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional
deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of
transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities
to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for
detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning
explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection
(EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model
(MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes
alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach
first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT)
to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing
rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we
construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which
introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process
to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress
hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In
addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset
(ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality
control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding
performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and
its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.
Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior
solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: 现有的RefAtomNet模型虽然通过代理注意力机制提升了性能，但在跨模态信息对齐和检索方面仍有局限，导致在定位目标人物和预测细粒度动作时表现不佳。

Method: 提出RefAtomNet++框架，采用多层级语义对齐的交叉注意力机制，结合在部分关键词、场景属性和整体句子层面的多轨迹Mamba建模，动态选择最近视觉空间token构建扫描轨迹。

Result: 实验表明RefAtomNet++在RefAVA++数据集上取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: RefAtomNet++通过改进的跨模态token聚合机制，显著提升了指代原子视频动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize
fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned
on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition
and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action
understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action
analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our
previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million
frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using
baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization,
video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier
model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by
incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to
align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to
suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting
fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce
RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation
through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism
combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword,
scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning
trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual
spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute
levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned
cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and
temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that
RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are
released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/refAVA2.

Motivation: 传统目标检测框架在处理旋转目标时表现不佳，特别是在航空影像、遥感和自动驾驶等应用中，需要准确捕捉方向变化。

Method: 采用高斯边界框表示和Bhattacharyya距离，引入各向异性高斯表示来处理方形物体，并集成旋转不变损失函数到最先进的深度学习旋转目标检测器中。

Abstract: Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant
challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial
imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object
detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often
underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in
capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss
function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the
Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition,
we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address
the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our
proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a
rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric
properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into
state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and
extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average
Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the
potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object
detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise
and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模基础模型时代，完全微调预训练网络对每个下游任务来说资源消耗过大。现有的视觉提示调优方法在专门化提示或丰富表示空间方面存在不足，特别是在具有挑战性的任务和数据稀缺设置中。

Method: VIPAMIN通过(1)将提示与嵌入空间中的语义信息区域对齐，(2)在预训练子空间之外注入新的表示方向，来增强自监督模型的适应能力。该方法仅需单次前向传播和轻量级操作。

Result: VIPAMIN在各种任务和数据集大小上持续提升性能，在视觉提示调优方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: VIPAMIN是一种简单有效的视觉提示初始化策略，能够显著增强自监督模型在下游任务中的适应能力，特别是在具有挑战性的场景中。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale foundation models, fully fine-tuning pretrained
networks for each downstream task is often prohibitively resource-intensive.
Prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative by introducing tunable prompts
while keeping the backbone frozen. However, existing visual prompt tuning
methods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation
space--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these
limitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce
settings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we
introduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances
adaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically
informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel
representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its
simplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight
operations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and
dataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子显微镜图像中线粒体分割的标注成本高问题，传统无监督域自适应方法性能有限，需要更有效的弱监督方法。

Method: 多任务学习框架，结合分割和中心检测任务，采用跨任务教学机制、类聚焦跨域对比学习和实例感知伪标签选择策略。

Result: 在多个挑战性数据集上验证，方法优于现有UDA和WDA方法，显著缩小与全监督方法的性能差距。

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督域自适应设置下表现出色，同时也能显著提升无监督域自适应的性能。

Abstract: Annotation-efficient segmentation of the numerous mitochondria instances from
various electron microscopy (EM) images is highly valuable for biological and
neuroscience research. Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods
can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each
domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical
applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA)
that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which
require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full
use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask
learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with
a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive
learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce
segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL)
selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise
pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse
pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations
and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also
achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过整合未来信息显著提升了目标导向视觉语言导航的性能。

Abstract: In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language
Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical
information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the
actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we
draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory
data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object
relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous
to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which
describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking
the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the
task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action
scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the
original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to
effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the
destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于3D高斯泼溅的压缩方法缺乏人体先验知识，导致在解码端的比特率效率和重建质量不理想，限制了其在可流式3D虚拟角色系统中的应用。

Method: 将高斯表示解耦为结构层（通过StyleUNet生成器将姿态映射到高斯）和运动层（利用SMPL-X模型紧凑表示时间姿态变化），支持分层压缩和渐进解码，并引入面部注意力机制保护身份和表情细节。

Result: 实验结果表明HGC-Avatar为快速3D虚拟角色渲染提供了可流式解决方案，在视觉质量和压缩效率方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HGC-Avatar通过分层设计和人体先验知识的有效利用，实现了动态虚拟角色的高效压缩和高质量渲染，解决了现有方法在比特率效率和重建质量方面的限制。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast,
photorealistic rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, showing strong potential in
immersive communication. However, in digital human encoding and transmission,
the compression methods based on general 3DGS representations are limited by
the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and
reconstruction quality at the decoder side, which hinders their application in
streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical
Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and
high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian
representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a
StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model
to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This
hierarchical design supports layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and
controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or
text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a
facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and
expression details under low-bitrate constraints. Experimental results
demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar
rendering, while significantly outperforming prior methods in both visual
quality and compression efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型在科学研究中的应用日益增多，但缺乏评估其在理解科学论文多模态复杂性方面可靠性的基准，特别是检测和解决文本、图表、方程之间的不一致性问题。

Method: 通过多阶段流程（审稿挖掘、LLM辅助过滤和人工验证）收集真实的不一致性案例，设计三个任务：不一致性识别、修复和配对匹配，并引入结构化JSON答案表示以减少语言偏见。

Result: 对21个领先的LMM模型进行基准测试，结果显示性能较低（26.1-54.2%），包括大型开源模型和专有模型，突显了多模态科学推理的挑战性。

Conclusion: 当前LMM模型在多模态科学推理方面仍面临重大挑战，需要进一步改进以构建可信赖的科学助手。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and
reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in
detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and
equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately
undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook
this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors
that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench
(Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first
benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific
papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering
and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on
this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy
and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and
reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to
address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice
evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding
the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations
that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic
cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models
(GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5
with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%),
underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating
progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

Result: 提出的方法在mAP上超越现有最佳方法1.8%。消融研究证实辅助学习使mAP提升3.7%，深度归一化程序提升4.2%。

Conclusion: OOS-DSD通过多任务辅助学习和深度归一化有效提升了缺货检测性能，证明了辅助任务对主任务性能的促进作用。

Abstract: Out-of-stock (OOS) detection is a very important retail verification process
that aims to infer the unavailability of products in their designated areas on
the shelf. In this paper, we introduce OOS-DSD, a novel deep learning-based
method that advances OOS detection through auxiliary learning. In particular,
we extend a well-established YOLOv8 object detection architecture with
additional convolutional branches to simultaneously detect OOS, segment
products, and estimate scene depth. While OOS detection and product
segmentation branches are trained using ground truth data, the depth estimation
branch is trained using pseudo-labeled annotations produced by the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation model Depth Anything V2. Furthermore,
since the aforementioned pseudo-labeled depth estimates display relative depth,
we propose an appropriate depth normalization procedure that stabilizes the
training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method
surpassed the performance of the SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% of the mean
average precision (mAP). In addition, ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of auxiliary learning and the proposed depth normalization
procedure, with the former increasing mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%.

Conclusion: 基于图注意力网络的自编码器方法能够有效实现图像分类和检索，通过代表性模型和注意力机制提升了性能。

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages
graphs and a graph attention network (GAT)-based autoencoder. Our approach is
representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval
process via the representative models we construct for the images and image
categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their
representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights
important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder
to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features
of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives
from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its
representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most
similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments
with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

TL;DR: READ是一种微调方法，通过添加token级重构和句子级对齐两个辅助目标来增强视觉语言模型的组合推理能力，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准对比目标训练的视觉语言模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，主要原因是文本编码器倾向于关注单个单词而非它们之间的关系。

Method: READ方法在对比学习基础上添加两个辅助目标：(1) token级重构目标：使用冻结的预训练解码器基于原始标题嵌入重构替代标题；(2) 句子级对齐目标：在嵌入空间中显式对齐改写句子。

Result: READ-CLIP在五个主要组合推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，比最强传统微调基线提升高达4.1%。应用于现有CLIP变体也能提升性能。

Conclusion: 重构和对齐目标具有互补优势：重构鼓励编码器捕捉标题内单词间关系，对齐确保不同措辞的改写具有一致表示。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard
contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the
ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic
elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder
to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation
reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual
objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text
Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional
reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a
token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder
reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original
caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns
paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model
derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the
state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning
benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up
to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including
NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --
reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former
encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,
while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed
with different wording.

Motivation: 现有步态识别方法使用预定义区域进行时间建模，固定或等效的时间尺度难以建模随时间动态变化的运动区域和适应其特定模式。

Method: 引入区域感知动态聚合与激励框架(GaitRDAE)，包含两个核心模块：RDA模块动态搜索每个区域的最佳时间感受野，RDE模块强调包含稳定行为模式运动区域的学习，同时抑制对更易受协变量影响的静态区域的关注。

Result: 实验结果表明GaitRDAE在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GaitRDAE框架通过自动搜索运动区域、分配自适应时间尺度和应用相应注意力，有效解决了步态识别中动态运动区域建模的挑战。

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various
applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the
unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially
when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically
use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal
scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to
model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their
specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic
Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for
motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding
attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the
Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the
optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic
Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions
containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static
regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that
GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

Motivation: AI生成内容的快速扩散加剧了虚假信息风险，特别是政治深度伪造会扭曲真相、破坏政治机构信任。现有检测模型大多在实验室合成数据上训练，难以泛化到真实社交媒体上的政治深度伪造。

Method: 基于政治深度伪造事件数据库构建系统基准，对学术界、政府和工业界的最先进深度伪造检测器进行系统性评估，包括免费和付费工具。

Result: 学术界和政府检测器表现较差，付费检测工具性能相对较高但仍有局限。所有检测器对真实政治深度伪造的泛化能力不足，尤其对视频领域的简单操作脆弱。

Conclusion: 需要开发政治背景化的深度伪造检测框架，以在真实世界环境中更好地保护公众。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in
generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large
language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media
effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political
deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In
turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted
deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are
trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting
their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes
circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we
introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes
Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes
shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation
of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and
industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform
relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher
performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to
generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to
simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for
politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard
the public in real-world settings.

Result: 实验表明SHIELD能有效缓解各种基准测试和LVLM家族中的物体幻觉问题，并在通用LVLM基准上表现优异，显示出广泛适用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD是一个无需训练的有效框架，成功缓解了LVLM中的物体幻觉问题，具有广泛的适用性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks.
However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate
object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous
work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM
hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical
bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose
SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three
strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing
noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks
with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate
that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse
benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on
the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be
released.

TL;DR: VisionSelector是一个轻量级即插即用的视觉令牌压缩框架，通过可学习的评分模块和可微Top-K机制，自适应选择关键视觉令牌，显著提升多模态大语言模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理高分辨率图像或多图像输入时面临大量视觉令牌带来的计算和内存瓶颈，现有令牌压缩技术受限于启发式规则，存在信息丢失和性能下降问题。

Method: 提出VisionSelector框架，包含与MLLM主干解耦的评分模块，采用可微Top-K机制和课程退火策略，实现端到端可学习的令牌选择过程，支持任意压缩率。

Result: 仅需12.85M可训练参数，在MME基准上保持100%准确率（30%保留预算），在10%保留预算下比先前方法提升12.14%，预填充速度提升一倍。

Conclusion: VisionSelector提供了一种高效自适应的令牌压缩解决方案，在各种压缩预算下均表现出优越性能，显著提升MLLM的计算效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant computational
and memory bottlenecks from the massive number of visual tokens generated by
high-resolution images or multi-image inputs. Previous token compression
techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding
critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks,
that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To
address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight
plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end
learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer
module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable
Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the
training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various
arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable
parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various
compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to
superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving
100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by
12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed. Our code is

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however,
interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and
susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing
techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for

segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80
milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and
segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These
results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate
diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI
integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

Motivation: 解决小型无人机在受控室内环境中自主飞行的挑战，避免对GPS和昂贵传感器（如LiDAR）的依赖，同时实现准确的距离测量和实时处理。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏框架，使用基于颜色的SVM教师网络生成训练数据，训练轻量级U-Net学生网络进行实时语义分割；开发自适应尺度因子算法将非度量深度预测转换为准确度量距离；通过端到端学习训练紧凑神经网络学习完整飞行策略。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了结构化环境中基于视觉的无人机导航实践，解决了度量深度估计和计算效率挑战，可在资源受限平台上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents a vision-only autonomous flight system for small UAVs
operating in controlled indoor environments. The system combines semantic
segmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance,
scene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS
or expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale
factor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into
accurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane
detection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of
14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a
color-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a
lightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time
semantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be
replaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model. Testing was conducted in a
controlled 5x4 meter laboratory environment with eight cardboard obstacles
simulating urban structures. Extensive validation across 30 flight tests in a
real-world environment and 100 flight tests in a digital-twin environment
demonstrates that the combined segmentation and depth approach increases the
distance traveled during surveillance and reduces mission time while
maintaining 100% success rates. The system is further optimized through
end-to-end learning, where a compact student neural network learns complete
flight policies from demonstration data generated by our best-performing
method, achieving an 87.5% autonomous mission success rate. This work advances
practical vision-based drone navigation in structured environments,
demonstrating solutions for metric depth estimation and computational
efficiency challenges that enable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiVerse是一个新颖的多轮对话基准测试，包含647个对话，涵盖12个VLM评估基准的484个任务，用于评估视觉语言模型在多轮对话中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多轮对话数据集（如MMDU、ConvBench）无法完全捕捉真实世界对话场景的广度和深度，需要更全面的基准来评估VLM的多轮交互能力。

Method: 从12个流行的VLM评估基准中提取647个对话，每个对话平均4轮；使用基于检查表的评估方法，利用GPT-4o作为自动评估器，测量37个关键方面的性能。

Result: 评估了18个VLM，发现即使是最强的模型（如GPT-4o）在复杂多轮对话中也仅达到50%的成功率；提供完整对话上下文能显著提升较小或较弱模型的性能。

Conclusion: MultiVerse是评估VLM多轮交互能力的全面基准，揭示了当前模型在多轮对话中的局限性，并强调了上下文学习的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on
single-turn benchmarks, yet real-world applications often demand more intricate
multi-turn dialogues. Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g, MMDU, ConvBench) only
partially capture the breadth and depth of conversational scenarios encountered
by users. In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn
conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues - each averaging four turns -
derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484
tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from
factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a
checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated
evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual
accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on
MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve
only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the
dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue
context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models,
emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a
landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法将场景图序列化为文本放入LLM上下文窗口，但这种方法无法扩展到大型或丰富的3D场景图。需要更高效的连接自然语言与机器人世界表示的方法。

Method: 使用检索增强生成方法，将3D场景图编码到图数据库中，为LLM提供Cypher查询语言作为工具接口，使其能够检索与任务相关的数据。

Result: 在指令跟随和场景问答任务上的评估显示，使用Cypher作为3D场景图接口的方法在大型、丰富图上的扩展性显著优于基线方法，性能大幅提升，同时大幅减少了场景图内容的token数量。

Conclusion: Cypher查询语言作为3D场景图的接口，在基于本地和云端的模型上都能显著扩展到大型、丰富的图结构，为自然语言接地任务带来巨大性能改进。

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a
user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the
robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for
grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address
the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing
methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context
window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we
propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of
the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide
a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can
retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on
instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against
baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that
using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to
large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large
performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially
reducing the token count of the scene graph content. A video supplement is

TL;DR: 提出了针对病理学基础模型的通用可迁移对抗扰动(UTAP)，这是一种固定的弱噪声模式，能够系统性地破坏多个病理学基础模型的特征表示能力，导致下游任务性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示病理学基础模型的关键脆弱性，为模型鲁棒性评估建立高标准基准，推动防御机制发展，确保AI在病理学中的安全可靠部署。

Method: 使用深度学习优化生成固定的弱噪声模式UTAP，该扰动具有通用性和可迁移性，能够应用于不同的视野范围并成功降低各种外部黑盒病理学基础模型的性能。

Result: 在多个最先进的病理学基础模型和数据集上系统评估，UTAP通过视觉上难以察觉的输入图像修改，导致模型性能显著下降，并成功攻击了未见过的黑盒模型。

Conclusion: UTAP构成了对各种新兴病理学基础模型及其应用的广泛威胁，强调了推进防御机制和对抗训练的必要性，以确保AI在病理学中的安全部署。

Abstract: We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for
pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their
capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak
noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts
the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation
models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that
utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of
unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,
we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can
be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP
was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully
degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation
models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a
dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset,
but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation
models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various
state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a
significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications
to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these
potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model
robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and
potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure
the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.

Result: 在所有指标上达到SOTA性能，精度提升18%，在不同通道深度下推理速度均快于当前SOTA模型。

Conclusion: HYDRA方法有效解决了先前光谱重建模型的关键限制，实现了高质量的光谱重建。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSI) promise to support a range of new applications in
computer vision. Recent research has explored the feasibility of generalizable
Spectral Reconstruction (SR), the problem of recovering a HSI from a natural
three-channel color image in unseen scenarios.
  However, previous Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) works have only demonstrated
sufficient generalizable results for very sparse spectra, while modern HSI
sensors contain hundreds of channels.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to spectral reconstruction via our
HYbrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Architecture (HYDRA).
  Using a Teacher model that encapsulates latent hyperspectral image data and a
Student model that learns mappings from natural images to the Teacher's encoded
domain, alongside a novel training method, we achieve high-quality spectral
reconstruction.
  This addresses key limitations of prior SR models, providing SOTA performance
across all metrics, including an 18\% boost in accuracy, and faster inference
times than current SOTA models at various channel depths.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在3D空间推理中的两个基本瓶颈：2D中心预训练导致的3D理解能力不足，以及冗余3D信息引发的推理失败。

Method: 双智能体框架：感知智能体使用感知工具箱程序化查询3D场景提取充分信息（包括新颖的SOG模块），推理智能体迭代精炼信息追求最小化，通过闭环剪枝冗余和补充缺失信息直到构建最小充分集。

Conclusion: 通过明确追求充分性和最小化，MSSR框架有效解决了3D空间推理问题，并为未来模型提供了高质量训练数据源。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding,
remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify
two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming
from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D
information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set
(MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of
3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal
Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this
principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a
versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a
novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts
language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this
information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting
missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and
minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework
produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of
high-quality training data for future models. Source code is available at

Result: 在IEEE SPS VIP Cup真实世界噪声OCT数据集上，通过CNR、MSR、TP和EP等指标验证了性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在仅有真实世界噪声OCT图像的情况下有效提升图像质量，具有改善临床诊断结果的潜力。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a widely used non-invasive imaging
technique that provides detailed three-dimensional views of the retina, which
are essential for the early and accurate diagnosis of ocular diseases.
Consequently, OCT image analysis and processing have emerged as key research
areas in biomedical imaging. However, acquiring paired datasets of clean and
real-world noisy OCT images for supervised denoising models remains a
formidable challenge due to intrinsic speckle noise and practical constraints
in clinical imaging environments. To address these issues, we propose SDPA++: A
General Framework for Self-Supervised Denoising with Patch Aggregation. Our
novel approach leverages only noisy OCT images by first generating
pseudo-ground-truth images through self-fusion and self-supervised denoising.
These refined images then serve as targets to train an ensemble of denoising
models using a patch-based strategy that effectively enhances image clarity.
Performance improvements are validated via metrics such as Contrast-to-Noise
Ratio (CNR), Mean Square Ratio (MSR), Texture Preservation (TP), and Edge
Preservation (EP) on the real-world dataset from the IEEE SPS Video and Image
Processing Cup. Notably, the VIP Cup dataset contains only real-world noisy OCT
images without clean references, highlighting our method's potential for
improving image quality and diagnostic outcomes in clinical practice.

Motivation: 实践中训练和测试样本之间的分布偏移经常发生，阻碍模型泛化性能。虽然对比学习能够学习类别分离的表征，但直接应用对比学习在领域泛化中反而会降低性能，原因是领域泛化设置中缺乏类内连接性。

Method: 提出DCCL方法：在数据层面使用更激进的数据增强和跨领域正样本来提高类内连接性；在模型层面提出模型锚定技术，利用预训练表征中的类内连接性，并通过生成变换损失进行补充。

Result: 在五个标准领域泛化基准测试上进行了广泛实验，结果表明DCCL即使在没有领域监督的情况下也优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: DCCL通过增强跨领域的类内概念连接性，能够获得更具泛化能力的表征，有效解决领域泛化问题。

Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in
practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge
thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict
the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source
domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations
learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality
is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the
performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and
discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the
deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive
learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and
obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive
data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve
intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test
domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in
pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative
transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are
performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code
are provided through https://github.com/weitianxin/DCCL

Result: 在Human3.6M和HumanEva-I数据集上的实验表明，HumanCM达到与最先进扩散模型相当或更优的准确性，同时推理步骤减少达两个数量级。

Conclusion: HumanCM证明了通过一致性模型实现高效单步运动预测的可行性，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: We present HumanCM, a one-step human motion prediction framework built upon
consistency models. Instead of relying on multi-step denoising as in
diffusion-based methods, HumanCM performs efficient single-step generation by
learning a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states. The
framework adopts a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal
embeddings to model long-range dependencies and preserve motion coherence.
Experiments on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I demonstrate that HumanCM achieves
comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models while
reducing inference steps by up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to
achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of
the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper
bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded
Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a
complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building
corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a
method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning
dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments
across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new
framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT
reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning
and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding
scenarios.

Conclusion: 隐式残差世界模型通过专注于动态变化而非完全场景重建，显著提高了自动驾驶世界模型的效率和规划准确性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric
world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common
ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes,
which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds.
To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that
focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first
establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from
the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous
timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the
changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To
alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to
calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate
different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the
implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning
accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D
occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

TL;DR: UKANFormer是一种新颖的语义分割模型，能够在来自Allen Coral Atlas的噪声监督下实现高精度珊瑚礁映射，通过架构设计缓解标签噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球珊瑚礁产品如Allen Coral Atlas在空间精度和语义一致性方面存在限制，特别是在需要精细边界划分的区域，需要解决这些挑战以实现有效的珊瑚礁保护。

Method: 基于UKAN架构，UKANFormer在解码器中加入了全局-局部变换器（GL-Trans）块，能够同时提取全局语义结构和局部边界细节。

Result: UKANFormer在珊瑚类IoU达到67.00%，像素精度达到83.98%，在相同噪声标签设置下优于传统基线方法，产生的预测在视觉和结构上比训练用的噪声标签更准确。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明模型性能不一定直接受数据质量限制，架构设计可以缓解标签噪声，支持在非完美监督下进行可扩展的映射，为生态监测提供了基础。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet fragile ecosystems that require accurate
large-scale mapping for effective conservation. Although global products such
as the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef
distri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision
and semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary
delineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel
se-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under
noisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN
architecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans)
block in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic
structures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a
coral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming
conventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting. Remarkably, the
model produces predictions that are visually and structurally more accurate
than the noisy labels used for training. These results challenge the notion
that data quality directly limits model performance, showing that architectural
design can mitigate label noise and sup-port scalable mapping under imperfect
supervision. UKANFormer provides a foundation for ecological monitoring where
reliable labels are scarce.

Abstract: Embodied AI requires agents that perceive, act, and anticipate how actions
reshape future world states. World models serve as internal simulators that
capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to
support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a
unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize
the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy
encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2)

Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature
Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We
systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and
general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level
understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative
comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges,
including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics
that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between
model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time
control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal
consistency while mitigating error accumulation. Finally, we maintain a curated

TL;DR: 本文证明在视觉自回归模型中使用束搜索可以显著提升文本到图像生成质量，2B参数的自回归模型通过搜索策略能超越12B参数的扩散模型，表明模型架构对推理时优化至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然推理时搜索策略在大型语言模型中取得了革命性进展，但在图像生成领域应用有限，扩散模型中的搜索策略效果不佳，而自回归模型的离散序列特性可能更适合搜索优化。

Method: 在离散视觉自回归模型中应用束搜索策略，利用离散标记空间的特性实现早期剪枝和计算重用，并通过验证器分析权衡速度与推理能力。

Result: 束搜索显著提升了文本到图像生成质量，2B参数的自回归模型在多个基准测试中超越了12B参数的扩散模型，系统消融实验显示优势来自离散标记空间。

Conclusion: 模型架构（而不仅仅是规模）对于视觉生成中的推理时优化至关重要，离散自回归模型为搜索策略提供了更有效的平台。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language
Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult.
Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show
limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We
demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive
models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search
substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter
autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across
benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the
discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and
our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning
capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is
critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

Motivation: 随着SR模型容量增加，伪影问题日益突出，但不同伪影对人类感知的影响程度不同，需要根据显著度而非统一处理。

Method: 构建包含11种当代图像SR方法的1302个伪影示例数据集，每个伪影都有众包显著度评分，并基于此训练轻量级回归器。

Result: 训练的回归器在检测显著伪影方面优于现有方法，能够生成空间显著热图。

Conclusion: 提出了基于显著度的SR伪影评估方法，发布了数据集和代码以促进显著度感知的SR伪影评估和缓解。

Abstract: Generative image super-resolution (SR) is rapidly advancing in visual quality
and detail restoration. As the capacity of SR models expands, however, so does
their tendency to produce artifacts: incorrect, visually disturbing details
that reduce perceived quality. Crucially, their perceptual impact varies: some
artifacts are barely noticeable while others strongly degrade the image. We
argue that artifacts should be characterized by their prominence to human
observers rather than treated as uniform binary defects. Motivated by this, we
present a novel dataset of 1302 artifact examples from 11 contemporary image-SR
methods, where each artifact is paired with a crowdsourced prominence score.
Building on this dataset, we train a lightweight regressor that produces
spatial prominence heatmaps and outperforms existing methods at detecting
prominent artifacts. We release the dataset and code to facilitate
prominence-aware evaluation and mitigation of SR artifacts.

Motivation: 传统CNN方法在图像恢复中由于感受野小和缺乏通道特征建模，难以充分恢复精细纹理细节。

Method: 1) 全局多尺度小波变换卷积(GMWTConvs)扩展感受野；2) Mamba通道感知模块(MCAM)捕获通道间长程依赖；3) 多尺度纹理增强损失(MTELoss)指导纹理结构保留。

Conclusion: WaMaIR框架通过结合大感受野特征提取、通道感知建模和纹理增强损失，有效提升了图像恢复中纹理细节的重建质量。

Abstract: Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision,
where CNN-based frameworks demonstrate significant computational efficiency.
However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately
restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field
of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we
propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for
image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored
images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform
Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image
features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile,
we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to
capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the
model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we
propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to
guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively.
Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of
the model.

Motivation: 现有方法将图像区域孤立处理，仅依赖局部线索，导致编辑不一致、过渡不自然或整体连贯性丧失

Method: 引入双层级引导机制：区域在全图像上下文中表示并与详细区域级描述对齐，同时整个图像与视觉语言模型生成的场景级描述匹配

Result: 实验表明该方法能产生更连贯且与指令对齐的结果

Conclusion: 通过多层级语义对齐，实现了精确协调的图像编辑，使每个区域都能理解其在全局图像上下文中的角色

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image
regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in
isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part
contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results
in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the
image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for
text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment
between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about
edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to
understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and
harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance
mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with
detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously
matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large
vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references
of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure.
Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned
results. Code is available at:

Motivation: 现有医疗报告生成模型主要依赖LLM，对预训练视觉基础模型和高级微调技术探索有限，主流框架要么避免微调要么使用简单方法如LoRA，忽视了增强跨注意力机制的潜力。

Method: 将X射线图像分块、标记化，通过SSM基础的视觉骨干网络提取特征，使用Partial LoRA获得最优性能，结合混合解码器的LLM生成医疗报告，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验充分验证了所提策略对X射线医疗报告生成的有效性。

Conclusion: EMRRG框架通过参数高效方法微调预训练Mamba网络，在X射线医疗报告生成任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in
artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for
clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on
Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited
exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning
techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize
simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing
cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models
dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the
Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a
promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel
X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks
using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into
patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature
extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a
hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and
achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three
widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

Motivation: 传统6D姿态估计方法依赖2D-3D特征对应，在纹理缺失物体和光照变化条件下表现不佳，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出基于束调整原理的姿态回归算法，利用Lie代数扩展3DGS能力，构建姿态可微渲染管道，通过迭代优化输入图像与渲染图像的差异来优化姿态，并更新3DGS模型的颜色参数以适应光照变化。

Result: 在T-LESS、LineMod-Occlusion和LineMod数据集上分别实现了1.4%、2.8%和2.5%的精度提升。

Conclusion: GS2POSE通过结合3DGS和束调整原理，有效解决了纹理缺失和光照变化下的6D姿态估计问题，在多个基准数据集上取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of 3D objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, and current research typically predicts the 6D pose by establishing
correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features. However, these
methods often face difficulties with textureless objects and varying
illumination conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GS2POSE, a
novel approach for 6D object pose estimation. GS2POSE formulates a pose
regression algorithm inspired by the principles of Bundle Adjustment (BA). By
leveraging Lie algebra, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS to develop a
pose-differentiable rendering pipeline, which iteratively optimizes the pose by
comparing the input image to the rendered image. Additionally, GS2POSE updates
color parameters within the 3DGS model, enhancing its adaptability to changes
in illumination. Compared to previous models, GS2POSE demonstrates accuracy
improvements of 1.4\%, 2.8\% and 2.5\% on the T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion and
LineMod datasets, respectively.

Motivation: 现有视频理解模型依赖大量标注数据和任务特定训练，成本高且扩展性差。大型视觉语言模型在静态图像上的零样本推理能力尚未充分应用于视频领域。

Method: 使用预训练VLM的冻结视觉编码器将视频流转换为语义特征轨迹，采用核时间分割(KTS)将连续特征流划分为离散语义事件段，然后通过无监督密度聚类识别重复的宏观场景和主题，最后从每个聚类中选择代表性关键帧并利用VLM生成文本描述。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需端到端训练的视频理解解决方案，通过结合预训练VLM的语义先验和经典机器学习算法，实现了零样本的视频结构分析能力。

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual
Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the
video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,
task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and
limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework
for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically
combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine
learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video
understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a
high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms
a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual
encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal
Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the
continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.
These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to
identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By
selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging
the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework
automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.
This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway
for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要微调模型以产生与掩码解码器兼容的特定输出，这会改变模型的输出空间并损害其内在泛化能力，违背了构建统一模型的目标。

Method: LENS在完全冻结的MLLM上附加轻量级可训练头部，通过精炼注意力图中嵌入的空间线索来提取关键点，并将其描述为与掩码解码器直接兼容的点级特征。

Result: LENS实现了与基于重训练方法相当或更优的分割性能，同时完全保留了MLLM的泛化能力，而微调方法会显著降低这种能力。

Conclusion: LENS的可附加设计为扩展MLLM建立了一个高效且强大的范式，为实现真正多才多艺的统一模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Integrating diverse visual capabilities into a unified model is a significant
trend in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Among these, the inclusion
of segmentation poses a distinct set of challenges. To equip MLLMs with
pixel-level segmentation abilities, prevailing methods require finetuning the
model to produce specific outputs compatible with a mask decoder. This process
typically alters the model's output space and compromises its intrinsic
generalization, which undermines the goal of building a unified model. We
introduce LENS (Leveraging kEypoiNts for MLLMs' Segmentation), a novel
plug-and-play solution. LENS attaches a lightweight, trainable head to a
completely frozen MLLM. By refining the spatial cues embedded in attention
maps, LENS extracts keypoints and describes them into point-wise features
directly compatible with the mask decoder. Extensive experiments validate our
approach: LENS achieves segmentation performance competitive with or superior
to that of retraining-based methods. Crucially, it does so while fully
preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities, which are significantly
degraded by finetuning approaches. As such, the attachable design of LENS
establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for extending MLLMs, paving the
way for truly multi-talented, unified models.

Motivation: 消除对昂贵手动标注数据集的依赖，实现可扩展的无监督道路分割，适用于自动驾驶场景。

Method: 首先基于几何先验生成弱标签（地平线上方为非道路，车辆前方四边形为道路），然后通过跨帧跟踪局部特征点并使用互信息最大化来强制时间一致性。

Result: 在Cityscapes数据集上实现了0.82的交并比(IoU)，表现出高精度和良好的时间稳定性。

Conclusion: 结合几何约束和时间一致性可以实现简单而有效的无监督道路分割，在自动驾驶中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully unsupervised approach for binary road
segmentation (road vs. non-road), eliminating the reliance on costly manually
labeled datasets. The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to
distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from
geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined
quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal
consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and
penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information
maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the
Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of
0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings
demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal
consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: PIF能够有效解决摄影风格学习和迁移的问题，在保持内容完整性的同时成功提取和转移摄影风格。

Abstract: Photographic style, as a composition of certain photographic concepts, is the
charm behind renowned photographers. But learning and transferring photographic
style need a profound understanding of how the photo is edited from the unknown
original appearance. Previous works either fail to learn meaningful
photographic concepts from reference images, or cannot preserve the content of
the content image. To tackle these issues, we proposed a Personalized Image
Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the
generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic
concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then
learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion
technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows
outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of
photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/

Method: 整合了76个CoralNet来源和红海Al Wajh站点的图像，提供专家验证的细粒度分类标注。提出了两种评估设置：源内基准测试和跨源基准测试，分别用于局部评估和领域泛化测试。

Result: 监督学习在源内表现良好，但跨域性能显著下降；零样本模型在所有情况下表现均较差，特别是对于稀有和视觉相似属类。这为领域泛化和细粒度珊瑚分类提供了具有挑战性的基准。

Conclusion: ReefNet数据集将公开发布，旨在推动稳健、领域自适应的全球珊瑚礁监测和保护技术的发展，为珊瑚礁生态系统的自动化监测提供重要资源。

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as
climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated
monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with
point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS).
ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional
site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level
hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets,
which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not
ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global
scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source
benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and
(ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain
generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification
performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance
is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and
performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare
and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to
catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral
classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained
models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and
conservation.

*Abdur Rahman,Mohammad Marufuzzaman,Jason Street,Haifeng Wang,Veera G. Gude,Randy Buchanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AdaptMoist的领域自适应方法，利用纹理特征预测木屑水分含量，解决了不同来源木屑数据分布变化的问题，将跨领域预测准确率从57%提升到80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有木屑水分含量预测方法存在局限性：直接方法（烘箱干燥）处理时间长且破坏样本；间接方法（近红外光谱、电容、图像）在不同来源木屑上准确性不足。需要一种能够有效应对来源变异性的稳健方法。

Method: 1. 从木屑图像中提取五种不同的纹理特征；2. 提出AdaptMoist领域自适应方法，利用纹理特征将知识从一个木屑数据源转移到另一个；3. 提出基于调整互信息的模型保存标准。

Result: 1. 结合所有五种纹理特征的特征集达到95%的准确率；2. AdaptMoist方法将跨领域预测准确率提高23%，平均准确率达到80%，相比非自适应模型的57%。

Conclusion: AdaptMoist作为一种稳健的木屑水分含量估计解决方案，在跨领域应用中表现出色，有望成为依赖木屑的行业的潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and quick prediction of wood chip moisture content is critical for
optimizing biofuel production and ensuring energy efficiency. The current
widely used direct method (oven drying) is limited by its longer processing
time and sample destructiveness. On the other hand, existing indirect methods,
including near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and
image-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from
various sources. Variability in the source material can alter data
distributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore,
there is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of
source variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture
features have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on
this, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct
texture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture
content. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five
texture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms
individual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust
moisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist
that utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of
wood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We
also proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual
information. The AdaptMoist method improves prediction accuracy across domains
by 23%, achieving an average accuracy of 80%, compared to 57% for non-adapted
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of AdaptMoist as a robust
solution for wood chip moisture content estimation across domains, making it a
potential solution for wood chip-reliant industries.

*Xiangyu Mu,Dongliang Zhou,Jie Hou,Haijun Zhang,Weili Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出M2HVideo框架，将人体模型视频转换为身份可控、逼真的人类视频，解决头部与身体运动不对齐和身份漂移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人体模型服装展示成本低但缺乏真实感和表达细节，需要将其转换为更真实的人类视频展示

Method: 使用动态姿态感知头部编码器融合面部语义和身体姿态，引入镜像损失和分布感知适配器，基于DDIM的一步去噪

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，在服装一致性、身份保持和视频保真度方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: M2HVideo能有效生成身份可控、逼真的人类视频，为在线时尚展示提供高质量解决方案

Abstract: Mannequin-based clothing displays offer a cost-effective alternative to
real-model showcases for online fashion presentation, but lack realism and
expressive detail. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new task called
mannequin-to-human (M2H) video generation, which aims to synthesize
identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos from footage of mannequins.
We propose M2HVideo, a pose-aware and identity-preserving video generation
framework that addresses two key challenges: the misalignment between head and
body motion, and identity drift caused by temporal modeling. In particular,
M2HVideo incorporates a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial
semantics with body pose to produce consistent identity embeddings across
frames. To address the loss of fine facial details due to latent space
compression, we introduce a mirror loss applied in pixel space through a
denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)-based one-step denoising.
Additionally, we design a distribution-aware adapter that aligns statistical
distributions of identity and clothing features to enhance temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, our self-constructed ASOS
dataset, and the newly collected MannequinVideos dataset captured on-site
demonstrate that M2HVideo achieves superior performance in terms of clothing
consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity in comparison to
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 2DGS-R是一种改进的2D高斯泼溅方法，通过分层训练策略在保持几何精度的同时提升渲染质量，仅需1%额外存储和少量训练时间即可实现高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)难以准确表示表面，而2DGS虽然几何保真度有所提升但渲染质量仍然受损，目前无法在单次训练中同时优化几何和渲染质量。

Method: 采用分层训练方法：首先用法向一致性正则化训练原始2D高斯；然后选择渲染质量不足的2D高斯进行原地克隆操作；最后在冻结不透明度的条件下微调模型。

Result: 相比原始2DGS，仅需1%额外存储和最小额外训练时间，在保持精细几何结构的同时实现了高质量渲染结果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了效率与性能，在视觉保真度和几何重建精度方面均有提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced
neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual
quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In
contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian
disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains
compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality
rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both
geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently
unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that
uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while
maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians
with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D
Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place
cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R
model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the
original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\% more storage and minimal additional
training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality
rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings
indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance,
leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction
accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统武器检测方法只能提供粗略的边界框定位，缺乏像素级精度；现有语义分割模型要么牺牲精度追求效率，要么计算资源需求过高，不适合边缘部署场景。

Method: 结合CBAM增强的编码器骨干网络和注意力集成汉堡解码器，实现五类武器（手枪、步枪、刀、左轮手枪、人）的语义分割。

Conclusion: ArmFormer是部署在便携安全摄像头、监控无人机和嵌入式AI加速器上的最优解决方案，计算需求比重量级模型低48倍。

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated
detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat
assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection
approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse
bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for
comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation
models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require
excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios.
This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic
segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve
superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for
resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder
backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class
weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver,
and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while
maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M
parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more
computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable
security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in
distributed security infrastructure.

### [85] [BARL: Bilateral Alignment in Representation and Label Spaces for Semi-Supervised Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16863)
*Shujian Gao,Yuan Wang,Zekuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BARL是一个半监督医学图像分割框架，通过在表示空间和标签空间同时进行对齐，显著提升了分割性能并减少了标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督医学图像分割方法主要依赖标签空间一致性，但忽略了表示空间对齐的重要性，导致模型难以学习到既具有判别性又具有空间一致性的特征表示。

Method: 提出BARL框架，包含两个协作分支：标签空间对齐使用双路径正则化(DPR)和渐进认知偏差校正(PCBC)；表示空间对齐通过区域级和病灶实例级匹配来捕捉医学图像中复杂的分割模式。

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集和一个私有CBCT数据集上的实验表明，BARL持续超越最先进的半监督医学图像分割方法。消融研究验证了各组件的贡献。

Conclusion: BARL通过双空间对齐有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能，为减少标注成本提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) seeks to match fully
supervised performance while sharply reducing annotation cost. Mainstream SSMIS
methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally
critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent
features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative
and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment
in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples
two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For
label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we
devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively
Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch
consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For
representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance
matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex
pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four
public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further
validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于内存库的3D异常检测方法存在特征变换不一致和判别能力有限的问题，特别是在捕捉局部几何细节和实现旋转不变性方面。点云配准在引导特征提取方面具有重要作用。

Method: 提出配准诱导的旋转不变特征提取框架，将特征提取嵌入到配准学习过程中，联合优化配准和表示学习，使网络获得对旋转鲁棒且对异常检测有效的特征。

Result: 在Anomaly-ShapeNet和Real3D-AD数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在有效性和泛化性方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过将点云配准与异常检测任务集成，可以学习到既对旋转鲁棒又对异常检测有效的特征表示，显著提升3D异常检测性能。

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection in point-cloud data is critical for industrial quality
control, aiming to identify structural defects with high reliability. However,
current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature
transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing
local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations
become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection
results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not
only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction
toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this
end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction
framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and
memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on
modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across
samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning
process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning.
This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust
to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments
on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and
generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出了一个神经元级别的分析框架，通过人类大脑活动来研究视觉语言模型中的多模态信息处理机制，揭示了ANN和BN之间的共享表征机制、功能冗余、极性模式相似性以及架构对脑相似性质的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对人工神经网络与人类大脑处理之间相似性的理解有限：单模态ANN研究无法捕捉大脑固有的多模态处理能力，而多模态ANN研究主要关注高层模型输出，忽视了单个神经元的关键作用。

Method: 提出了一个结合精细人工神经元分析和基于fMRI的体素编码的神经元级别分析框架，研究了CLIP和METER两种架构不同的视觉语言模型。

Result: 发现：(1) ANs能成功预测多个功能网络中BNs的活动；(2) ANs和BNs都表现出功能冗余；(3) ANs表现出与BNs平行的极性模式；(4) CLIP和METER的架构驱动不同的BNs：CLIP显示模态特定专业化，METER产生统一跨模态激活。

Conclusion: 这些结果为视觉语言模型中神经元级别的脑相似层次处理提供了有力证据。

Abstract: While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising
results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN
studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing
capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level
model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that
investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in
vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our
approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with
fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP
and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict
biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks
(including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared
representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional
redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's
fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs
exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs
showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity
and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The
architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches
show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design
yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's
influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling
evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.

Abstract: Generative models, especially Diffusion Models, have demonstrated remarkable
capability in generating high-quality synthetic data, including medical images.
However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to
generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting
their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address
this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely,
Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our
Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide
image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better
control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and
diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance,
highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique
integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the
quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Munia03/Class-N-Diff.

Conclusion: Edit-R1是一个模型无关的后训练框架，能够显著提升指令图像编辑模型的性能，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however,
models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated
patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training
distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training
framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization.
Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a
likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching
forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more
efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal
reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and
tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)
as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to
provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance
group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize
optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks,
scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is
model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to
diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its
wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空业的非CO2效应（特别是凝结尾迹）对气候影响显著，但验证和校准物理模型需要将观测到的凝结尾迹与生成它们的航班联系起来，而卫星归因因分辨率限制面临挑战。

Conclusion: 地面相机方法在凝结尾迹形成后不久捕获高分辨率图像，为凝结尾迹到航班归因提供了可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Aviation's non-CO2 effects, particularly contrails, are a significant
contributor to its climate impact. Persistent contrails can evolve into
cirrus-like clouds that trap outgoing infrared radiation, with radiative
forcing potentially comparable to or exceeding that of aviation's CO2
emissions. While physical models simulate contrail formation, evolution and
dissipation, validating and calibrating these models requires linking observed
contrails to the flights that generated them, a process known as
contrail-to-flight attribution. Satellite-based attribution is challenging due
to limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform
before detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using
ground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high
spatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually
distinct. Leveraging the ground visible camera contrail sequences (GVCCS)
dataset, we introduce a modular framework for attributing contrails observed
using ground-based cameras to theoretical contrails derived from aircraft
surveillance and meteorological data. The framework accommodates multiple
geometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal
smoothing, and enables flexible probability-based assignment strategies. This
work establishes a strong baseline and provides a modular framework for future
research in linking contrails to their source flight.

Abstract: Thermal weapon segmentation is crucial for surveillance and security
applications, enabling robust detection under lowlight and visually obscured
conditions where RGB-based systems fail. While convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) dominate thermal segmentation literature, their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and fine structural details is limited. Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with their global context modeling capabilities, have
achieved state-of-the-art results in RGB segmentation tasks, yet their
potential in thermal weapon segmentation remains underexplored. This work
adapts and evaluates four transformer-based architectures SegFormer,
DeepLabV3\+, SegNeXt, and Swin Transformer for binary weapon segmentation on a
custom thermal dataset comprising 9,711 images collected from real world
surveillance videos and automatically annotated using SAM2. We employ standard
augmentation strategies within the MMSegmentation framework to ensure robust
model training and fair architectural comparison. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance: SegFormer-b5
achieves the highest mIoU (94.15\%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04\%), while
SegFormer-b0 provides the fastest inference speed (98.32 FPS) with competitive
mIoU (90.84\%). SegNeXt-mscans offers balanced performance with 85.12 FPS and
92.24\% mIoU, and DeepLabV3\+ R101-D8 reaches 92.76\% mIoU at 29.86 FPS. The
transformer architectures demonstrate robust generalization capabilities for
weapon detection in low-light and occluded thermal environments, with flexible
accuracy-speed trade-offs suitable for diverse real-time security applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image

performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness -
whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address
this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising
14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions.
We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy
metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple
robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance
trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring
performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale
evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and
task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing
strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of
fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation
models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong
zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from
segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models,
FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to
learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream
clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid
proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented,
lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of
architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities.
To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and
structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically
categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their
architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks.
Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to
characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We
also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation,
efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along
with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and
advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed
at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs,
thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成质量高但计算成本昂贵，现有蒸馏方法缺乏统一的理论基础。

Method: 将扩散蒸馏构建为Bregman散度密度比匹配问题，提供凸分析视角统一多种现有目标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和文本到图像生成任务上，相比反向KL蒸馏获得更好的一步FID指标，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: Bregman密度比匹配是通向高效一步扩散生成的实际且理论可靠的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but remain
computationally expensive due to slow multi-step sampling. Distillation methods
accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing
objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose
Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as
Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view
connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves
improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual
fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman
density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward
efficient one-step diffusion generation.

TL;DR: 提出了CARE框架，通过序列-图像对比对齐方法解决ADL识别中序列和图像表示之间的对齐问题，在三个CASAS数据集上取得最先进性能


<details>

Motivation: 现有ADL识别方法存在表示层面的限制：序列方法保持时间顺序但对噪声敏感且缺乏空间意识，图像方法捕获全局模式但压缩时间动态且扭曲传感器布局，简单融合方法无法有效对齐两种表示视图

Method: CARE框架包含：(1)时间感知、抗噪声的序列编码；(2)空间感知和频率敏感的图像表示；(3)联合对比-分类目标函数，通过序列-图像对比对齐(SICA)和交叉熵联合优化表示学习和分类

Result: 在三个CASAS数据集上取得最先进性能：Milan 89.8%、Cairo 88.9%、Kyoto7 73.3%，并展示了对传感器故障和布局变化的鲁棒性

Conclusion: CARE框架通过序列-图像对比对齐实现了对齐且具有区分性的嵌入学习，在智能家居中为可靠的ADL识别提供了潜力

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered
ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing
methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based
approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to
noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global
patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal
dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation)
fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation
views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive
Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an
end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via
Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via
cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific
discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence
encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image
representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective
for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on
three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on
Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to
sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for
reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.

TL;DR: 本文提出BaGLM方法，利用大型多模态模型的零样本能力，实现无需训练的视频步骤定位，并通过贝叶斯滤波整合历史帧信息，在三个数据集上超越基于训练的离线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频步骤定位方法需要带标注的训练数据和离线处理整个视频，成本高且无法满足在线决策需求。本文探索如何在不训练的情况下在线执行VSG任务。

Method: 使用大型多模态模型预测有限帧的步骤，无需访问完整视频。开发BaGLM方法，通过贝叶斯滤波原则整合历史帧知识，包括使用大型语言模型提取的依赖矩阵和步骤进度估计。

Result: 实验表明，这种无需任务特定调优的在线策略优于离线和基于训练的模型。BaGLM在三个数据集上表现优于最先进的基于训练的离线方法。

Conclusion: 利用大型多模态模型的零样本能力可以实现高效的无训练在线视频步骤定位，BaGLM方法通过整合时序信息进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Given a task and a set of steps composing it, Video Step Grounding (VSG) aims
to detect which steps are performed in a video. Standard approaches for this
task require a labeled training set (e.g., with step-level annotations or
narrations), which may be costly to collect. Moreover, they process the full
video offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online
decisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without
training. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step
associated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video.
We show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms
offline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop
Bayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting
knowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits
Bayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency
matrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step
progress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over
state-of-the-art training-based offline methods.

Motivation: 当前视频时序定位研究过于集中在少数视频表示方法上，可能导致架构过拟合。需要研究不同视频特征对经典架构的影响。

Method: 在三个基准数据集上使用基于CNN、时序推理和Transformer的视频编码器提取特征，并在经典架构上测试这些特征。

Result: 结果显示仅改变视频编码器就能显著影响模型性能，同时揭示了使用某些特征时的明显模式和错误。

Abstract: Temporal video grounding is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to
localize a natural language query in a long, untrimmed video. It has a key role
in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated
every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research
remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead
to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose
an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a
classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks,
Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on
CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant
differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video
encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of
certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities,
including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized
for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the
distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and
types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we
systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more
useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small
scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of
remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream
tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID,
an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications
specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring
consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.

Motivation: 利用多模态LLM的能力联合处理文本和视频，有效定位视频中的自然语言查询，解决直接定位时信息不足的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先将语言查询转换为包含缺失细节和线索的增强句子，然后使用轻量级解码器基于增强查询的上下文表示预测准确边界。使用多实例学习目标动态选择最佳查询版本。

Result: 在视频时序定位和段落定位基准测试中取得最先进结果，显著优于所有先前提出的基于LLM的时序定位方法，在零样本评估场景中保持明显优势。

Conclusion: ED-VTG方法在视频时序定位任务中表现出色，既优于或可比专门模型，又在零样本场景中具有明显优势，证明了多模态LLM在细粒度视频理解中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce ED-VTG, a method for fine-grained video temporal grounding
utilizing multi-modal large language models. Our approach harnesses the
capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to
effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage
process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially
transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues
to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded,
using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate
boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched
queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model
is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects
the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding
and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method
significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding
approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while
maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出W2R2训练框架，通过解耦表示学习和针对性捷径抑制来解决多模态3D定位中的2D语义偏见问题，在不改变推理架构的情况下提升3D定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态3D定位模型存在严重的"2D语义偏见"，过度依赖2D图像特征进行粗略定位，而忽视3D几何输入，导致融合性能不佳。

Method: W2R2框架将2D特征作为"What"识别的语义信标，3D特征作为"Where"定位的空间锚点，采用双目标损失函数：对齐损失通过适应交叉熵监督融合预测，伪标签损失通过基于边界的机制惩罚2D主导的伪输出。

Result: 在ScanRefer和ScanQA数据集上的实验表明，W2R2在定位精度和鲁棒性方面取得显著提升，特别是在杂乱户外场景中。

Conclusion: W2R2通过解耦表示学习和针对性捷径抑制，有效解决了多模态3D定位中的2D语义偏见问题，实现了更精确的3D定位。

Abstract: Multimodal 3D grounding has garnered considerable interest in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) \cite{yin2025spatial} for advancing spatial reasoning in complex
environments. However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias"
that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization,
largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called
What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via
disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our
approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D
features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as
spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without
modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss
function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted
cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes
overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism.
Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of
W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness,
particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.

Method: 使用条件StyleGAN2-ADA和StyleGAN3架构生成高分辨率合成活体指纹（按特定手指身份条件化），然后通过CycleGAN将这些转换为模拟各种呈现攻击材料（如EcoFlex、Play-Doh）的逼真伪造指纹。

Result: StyleGAN3模型实现了低至5的FID分数，生成的指纹在0.01%错误接受率下达到99.47%的真实接受率；StyleGAN2-ADA模型在相同条件下达到98.67%的真实接受率。创建了两个各含1500张指纹图像的数据集，包含八种材料类型的伪造指纹。

Abstract: Large fingerprint datasets, while important for training and evaluation, are
time-consuming and expensive to collect and require strict privacy measures.
Researchers are exploring the use of synthetic fingerprint data to address
these issues. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic
fingerprint images (both spoof and live), addressing concerns related to
privacy, cost, and accessibility in biometric data collection. Our approach
utilizes conditional StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3 architectures to produce
high-resolution synthetic live fingerprints, conditioned on specific finger
identities (thumb through little finger). Additionally, we employ CycleGANs to
translate these into realistic spoof fingerprints, simulating a variety of
presentation attack materials (e.g., EcoFlex, Play-Doh). These synthetic spoof
fingerprints are crucial for developing robust spoof detection systems. Through
these generative models, we created two synthetic datasets (DB2 and DB3), each
containing 1,500 fingerprint images of all ten fingers with multiple
impressions per finger, and including corresponding spoofs in eight material
types. The results indicate robust performance: our StyleGAN3 model achieves a
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) as low as 5, and the generated fingerprints
achieve a True Accept Rate of 99.47% at a 0.01% False Accept Rate. The
StyleGAN2-ADA model achieved a TAR of 98.67% at the same 0.01% FAR. We assess
fingerprint quality using standard metrics (NFIQ2, MINDTCT), and notably,
matching experiments confirm strong privacy preservation, with no significant
evidence of identity leakage, confirming the strong privacy-preserving
properties of our synthetic datasets.

Result: VNet达到最佳性能（Dice = 0.83，IoU = 0.71），放射组学稳定性（平均相关性=0.76，ICC=0.65），半监督学习下的预测准确性（准确率=0.88，F1=0.83）。半监督学习在所有模型中始终优于监督学习。放射科医生更青睐VNet的瘤周表示和平滑边界。

Conclusion: 将VNet与半监督学习结合可产生准确、可重复且临床可信的基于CT的肺癌预后预测，展示了实现以医生为中心的AI转化的可行路径。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, with CT imaging
central to screening, prognosis, and treatment. Manual segmentation is variable
and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces
barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework,
this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance
reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data
from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models
(3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against
expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation
reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via
Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic
modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38
dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians
qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical
meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow
integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71),
radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive
accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed
SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and
smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement
rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with
SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer
prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI
translation.

Abstract: Advanced feature extraction methods have significantly contributed to
enhancing the task of person re-identification. In addition, modifications to
objective functions have been developed to further improve performance.
Nonetheless, selecting better class representatives is an underexplored area of
research that can also lead to advancements in re-identification performance.
Although past works have experimented with using the centroid of a gallery
image class during training, only a few have investigated alternative
representations during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that
these prior techniques yield suboptimal results in terms of re-identification
metrics. To address the re-identification problem, we propose a generalized
selection method that involves choosing representations that are not limited to
class centroids. Our approach strikes a balance between accuracy and mean
average precision, leading to improvements beyond the state of the art. For
example, the actual number of representations per class can be adjusted to meet
specific application requirements. We apply our methodology on top of multiple
re-identification embeddings, and in all cases it substantially improves upon
contemporary results

Conclusion: 基于熵的推理时优化能有效提升视频推理性能，无需额外训练即可获得接近RL模型的准确率，同时大幅提高效率。

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly
reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in
substantial computational overhead during both training and inference.
Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning
models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as
a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of
micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process
grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or
thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking"
process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by
reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more
certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,
theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at
inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during
inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the
value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable
controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any
dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration
and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our
proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base
instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the
gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any
training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced
by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了通用视觉基础模型Hiera与专业化分割模型SAM2的特征通用性，发现专业化虽然提升空间相关任务性能，但会损失语义信息，导致在概念距离较远的任务上表现下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解通用基础视觉模型与专业化模型之间的权衡对于高效特征编码设计至关重要，但目前尚未完全明确。

Method: 使用轻量可训练颈部网络来探测冻结特征的适应性，通过信息论成本量化专业化代价，并进行跨颈部分析。

Result: SAM2在深度估计等空间相关任务上表现优异，但在姿态估计和图像描述等语义任务上不如通用模型Hiera，显示专业化导致语义信息损失。

Conclusion: 专业化在提升特定任务性能的同时会牺牲特征通用性，为设计高效特征编码和适应策略提供了量化基础。

Abstract: The trade-off between general-purpose foundation vision models and their
specialized counterparts is critical for efficient feature coding design and is
not yet fully understood. We investigate this trade-off by comparing the
feature versatility of the general-purpose Hiera encoder against the
segmentation-specialized Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Using a lightweight,
trainable neck to probe the adaptability of their frozen features, we quantify
the information-theoretic cost of specialization. Our results reveal that while
SAM2's specialization is highly effective for spatially-related tasks like
depth estimation, it comes at a cost. The specialized SAM2 encoder
underperforms its generalist predecessor, Hiera, on conceptually distant tasks
such as pose estimation and image captioning, demonstrating a measurable loss
of broader semantic information. A novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 reveals
that each level of adaptation creates a further representational bottleneck.
Our analysis illuminates these trade-offs in feature universality, providing a
quantitative foundation for designing efficient feature coding and adaptation
strategies for diverse downstream applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ProDAT方法，通过密度感知的尾丢弃机制实现点云的渐进式编码，在单一模型中支持多比特率解码，显著提升编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云在自动驾驶、增强现实等应用中需要实时处理和低延迟，但大数据量和带宽限制阻碍了在资源受限环境中的高质量服务部署。现有学习方法缺乏渐进解码能力。

Method: 提出密度感知的尾丢弃机制(ProDAT)，利用密度信息作为指导信号，根据重要性自适应解码潜在特征和坐标，实现单一模型的多比特率渐进解码。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，ProDAT不仅实现渐进编码，还在编码效率上优于现有学习方法，在SemanticKITTI上PSNR-D2的BD-rate提升超过28.6%，在ShapeNet上提升超过18.15%。

Conclusion: ProDAT成功解决了点云渐进编码问题，在保持高编码效率的同时支持多比特率解码，为资源受限环境中的点云应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in
applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive
communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their
large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of
high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding,
which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative
by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although
recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable
success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive
decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware
tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density
information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded
adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive
decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive
coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate
improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet

Motivation: 多模态目标检测在挑战性条件下通过多传感器模态的互补线索提高鲁棒性，但现有方法往往针对特定数据集，缺乏泛化性。

Method: FMCAF结合频域滤波块(Freq-Filter)抑制冗余频谱特征和基于跨注意力的融合模块(MCAF)改善模态间特征共享。

Result: 在LLVIP(低光行人检测)和VEDAI(航空车辆检测)数据集上，FMCAF优于传统融合方法，在VEDAI上mAP@50提升13.9%，LLVIP上提升1.1%。

Conclusion: FMCAF作为灵活的多模态融合基础架构，在未来的检测流程中具有潜力，无需数据集特定调优即可提升不同多模态挑战的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal object detection improves robustness in chal- lenging conditions
by leveraging complementary cues from multiple sensor modalities. We introduce
Filtered Multi- Modal Cross Attention Fusion (FMCAF), a preprocess- ing
architecture designed to enhance the fusion of RGB and infrared (IR) inputs.
FMCAF combines a frequency- domain filtering block (Freq-Filter) to suppress
redun- dant spectral features with a cross-attention-based fusion module (MCAF)
to improve intermodal feature sharing. Unlike approaches tailored to specific
datasets, FMCAF aims for generalizability, improving performance across
different multimodal challenges without requiring dataset- specific tuning. On
LLVIP (low-light pedestrian detec- tion) and VEDAI (aerial vehicle detection),
FMCAF outper- forms traditional fusion (concatenation), achieving +13.9% mAP@50
on VEDAI and +1.1% on LLVIP. These results support the potential of FMCAF as a
flexible foundation for robust multimodal fusion in future detection pipelines.

TL;DR: GSPlane通过引入平面先验来改进高斯泼溅的几何重建质量，特别针对平面区域提供更平滑、精确的网格重建，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法在重建平面区域时存在平滑度和精度不足的问题，而平面是3D场景中的基本元素，特别是在人造环境中。

Method: 利用现成的分割和法向预测模型提取平面先验，建立结构化表示；引入动态高斯重分类器自适应重新分类高梯度平面高斯；使用优化的平面先验优化网格布局。

Result: 在保持渲染质量的同时，显著提高了提取网格的几何精度，减少了顶点和面片数量，改善了拓扑结构。

Conclusion: GSPlane通过平面先验有效提升了高斯泼溅的几何重建质量，支持场景编辑和物理模拟等下游应用。

Abstract: Planes are fundamental primitives of 3D sences, especially in man-made
environments such as indoor spaces and urban streets. Representing these planes
in a structured and parameterized format facilitates scene editing and physical
simulations in downstream applications. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in the Novel View Synthesis task, with
extensions showing great potential in accurate surface reconstruction. However,
even state-of-the-art GS representations often struggle to reconstruct planar
regions with sufficient smoothness and precision. To address this issue, we
propose GSPlane, which recovers accurate geometry and produces clean and
well-structured mesh connectivity for plane regions in the reconstructed scene.
By leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction models, GSPlane
extracts robust planar priors to establish structured representations for
planar Gaussian coordinates, which help guide the training process by enforcing
geometric consistency. To further enhance training robustness, a Dynamic
Gaussian Re-classifier is introduced to adaptively reclassify planar Gaussians
with persistently high gradients as non-planar, ensuring more reliable
optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the optimized planar priors to refine the
mesh layouts, significantly improving topological structure while reducing the
number of vertices and faces. We also explore applications of the structured
planar representation, which enable decoupling and flexible manipulation of
objects on supportive planes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with no
sacrifice in rendering quality, the introduction of planar priors significantly
improves the geometric accuracy of the extracted meshes across various
baselines.

Motivation: 预训练扩散方法在低层视觉任务中表现出色，但往往牺牲内容保真度来获得更高的感知真实性，这一问题在低光场景中尤为严重。

Method: 引入潜在细化管道来恢复VAE编码中丢失的空间细节，并建立条件潜在与噪声潜在之间的动态双向交互机制。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法在预训练扩散方法中实现了显著的内容保真度提升。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种即插即用的优化策略，能够无缝集成到现有扩散网络中提供更有效的控制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable
Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several
low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods
often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This
issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded
information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two
primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent
modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional
latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a
novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models,
enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method
introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding,
i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors.
Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy
latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is
plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to
provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可见光通信需要高频调制，而本方法旨在在标准低帧率（30-60 fps）下实现水印提取，支持隐私保护和内容验证等应用。

Method: 采用光谱调制而非强度调制，联合考虑人眼视觉系统敏感性、相机传感器光谱灵敏度和窄带LED生成宽带白光的特性，优化LED光谱轮廓。

Result: 能够在10秒视频片段中嵌入128位信息，信息传输速率适中但足以支持基本元数据需求。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了对人眼不可见但对相机可检测的水印嵌入，为隐私保护和内容验证提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for using LED-based environmental lighting to
produce visually imperceptible watermarks for consumer cameras. Our approach
optimizes an LED light source's spectral profile to be minimally visible to the
human eye while remaining highly detectable by typical consumer cameras. The
method jointly considers the human visual system's sensitivity to visible
spectra, modern consumer camera sensors' spectral sensitivity, and narrowband
LEDs' ability to generate broadband spectra perceived as "white light"
(specifically, D65 illumination). To ensure imperceptibility, we employ
spectral modulation rather than intensity modulation. Unlike conventional
visible light communication, our approach enables watermark extraction at
standard low frame rates (30-60 fps). While the information transfer rate is
modest-embedding 128 bits within a 10-second video clip-this capacity is
sufficient for essential metadata supporting privacy protection and content
verification.

TL;DR: 提出GOOD框架，通过双重引导机制直接指导扩散采样轨迹生成OOD样本，提升OOD检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过扰动文本条件嵌入生成OOD样本，存在语义不稳定和偏移多样性不足的问题，限制了在真实OOD场景中的泛化能力

Method: GOOD框架包含双重引导：图像级引导基于对数分割梯度降低输入似然，驱动样本到像素空间低密度区域；特征级引导基于k-NN距离在分类器潜在空间中促进特征稀疏区域采样

Result: GOOD能够生成更可控和多样化的OOD样本，通过统一OOD评分自适应结合图像和特征差异，增强检测鲁棒性

Conclusion: 使用GOOD生成的样本训练可以显著提升OOD检测性能，经过定量和定性分析验证了其有效性

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for
synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the
performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on
perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and
insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To
address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that
directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using
off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level
guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to
reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel
space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the
classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence,
this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample
generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively
combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We
perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the
effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by
GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

Motivation: 铰接物体（如笔记本电脑和抽屉）由于多部件几何结构和可变关节配置，在3D重建和姿态估计方面面临挑战，这些结构多样性在不同状态下引入困难。

Method: 首先通过运动学感知VAE将完整几何、关节角度和部件分割编码到结构化潜在空间；然后使用两个条件扩散模型分别回归全局姿态和关节参数，以及从部分观测生成运动学感知潜在代码；最后通过迭代优化模块双向优化重建精度和运动学参数。

Conclusion: KineDiff3D框架在铰接物体重建和运动学参数估计方面表现出有效性，为处理结构多样性提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Articulated objects, such as laptops and drawers, exhibit significant
challenges for 3D reconstruction and pose estimation due to their multi-part
geometries and variable joint configurations, which introduce structural
diversity across different states. To address these challenges, we propose
KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object
Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing
diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input.
Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part
segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE
(KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for
regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating
the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce
an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction
accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while
preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their
kinematic properties.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在从2D图像推断3D几何方面存在空间推理能力不足的问题，限制了工业概念设计的应用。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：监督微调阶段使用深度和法线图作为几何先验形成多通道输入；强化学习阶段引入组长度奖励来促进简洁建模序列的生成。

Result: 在DeepCAD和Fusion360数据集上达到最先进性能，在代码有效性、几何精度和建模简洁性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GACO-CAD框架有效提升了从单图像生成可编辑CAD模型的几何准确性和建模效率，为工业设计降低了门槛。

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great
potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately
inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning
capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel
two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:
simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and
encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during
supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense
geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel
input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide
complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry
from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a
group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes
the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling
sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize
training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,
consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,
geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

Conclusion: 预处理在人脸识别系统中至关重要，考虑预处理因素可以显著提高面部对抗样本的对抗泛化能力。

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples that subtly alter benign facial images, exposing blind spots in these
systems, as well as protecting user privacy. End-to-end FR systems first obtain
preprocessed faces from diverse facial imagery prior to computing the
similarity of the deep feature embeddings. Whilst face preprocessing is a
critical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them,
we observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings.
Our study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different
preprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice
of face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%,
whereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively
minimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial
preprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the
unintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models.
Based on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using
input transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks
by up to 27%. Our findings highlight the importance of preprocessing in FR
systems, and the need for its consideration towards improving the adversarial
generalisation of facial adversarial examples.

TL;DR: GtR是一种无需训练的分层采样策略，通过将生成过程分解为结构生成和细节重建两个阶段，在保持生成质量的同时实现3.72倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决掩码自回归模型在视觉生成中并行生成能力受限的问题，因为单步建模空间相关视觉token的复杂性限制了其加速潜力。

Method: 提出GtR策略：第一阶段缓慢计算建立全局语义框架的结构生成，第二阶段快速计算完成剩余token的细节重建。还提出频率加权token选择(FTS)方法，为图像细节区域分配更多计算资源。

Result: 在ImageNet类条件生成和文本到图像生成任务中，MAR-H模型实现了3.72倍加速，同时保持可比质量(FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs 原始1.59, 299.1)。

Conclusion: GtR方法显著优于现有加速方法，在各种模型规模和生成任务中都能保持质量的同时大幅提升速度。

Abstract: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual
generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel
generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the
modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To
address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a
training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into
two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding,
followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens.
Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to
complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve
acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining
the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover,
observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic
information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose
Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to
tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high
frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and
text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining
comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1),
substantially outperforming existing acceleration methods across various model
scales and generation tasks. Our codes will be released in

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during
real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD)
between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex
morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel
species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid
advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton
recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision
developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address
this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating
various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset
\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection
methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM
\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our
constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with
substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only
provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton
recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton
OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale,
systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection
methods in plankton recognition. Code is available at

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D head avatars are vital for telepresence, gaming, and VR.
However, most methods focus solely on facial regions, ignoring natural
hand-face interactions, such as a hand resting on the chin or fingers gently
touching the cheek, which convey cognitive states like pondering. In this work,
we present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the
non-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.
  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand
and face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we
propose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose
tracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand.
Second, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations,
making them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we
learn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand
interaction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of
PCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field. Furthermore,
inspired by physics-based simulation, we incorporate a contact loss that
provides additional supervision, significantly reducing interpenetration
artifacts and enhancing the physical plausibility of the results.
  We evaluate our approach on RGB(D) videos captured by an iPhone.
Additionally, to better evaluate the reconstructed geometry, we construct a
synthetic dataset of avatars with various types of hand interactions. We show
that our method can capture better appearance and more accurate deforming
geometry of the face than SOTA surface reconstruction methods.

Motivation: 现有GCD方法假设训练时能同时访问标记和未标记数据且来自同一领域，限制了在开放世界场景中的适用性。DG-GCD要求模型泛化到包含新类别的未见领域，而无需在训练时访问目标域数据。

Method: 使用GPT引导的扩散进行源域增强，引入切线CutMix进行曲率感知插值，结合惩罚Busemann对齐、混合双曲对比正则化和自适应异常排斥的统一损失函数，以及可学习的曲率参数。

Conclusion: HIDISC通过双曲表示学习有效解决了DG-GCD问题，避免了高计算成本的模拟训练，实现了高效的领域和类别泛化。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify test-time samples into
either seen categories** -- available during training -- or novel ones, without
relying on label supervision. Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous
access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same
domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution
shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by
requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories,
without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD
method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains
and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error
accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework
that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic
simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we
augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting
while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we
introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes
pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A
unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic
contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates
compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter
further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves
state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently
outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一种零样本的视觉令牌剪枝方法，通过平衡任务相关性和信息多样性来减少视觉语言模型的推理成本，在剪枝90%令牌的情况下仍能保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型处理能力的增强，视觉令牌冗余导致推理成本急剧上升，现有剪枝方法忽视文本提示的指导，无法优先考虑任务相关性。

Method: 采用分层方法：首先选择任务相关的核心视觉令牌，然后补充多样性令牌以保留更广泛的上下文信息。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，该方法在剪枝高达90%令牌的情况下，性能达到或超过最先进水平，同时显著减少GPU内存占用和推理延迟。

Conclusion: 提出的提示感知视觉令牌剪枝方法能有效平衡任务相关性和信息多样性，在保持性能的同时大幅降低推理成本。

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can
process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant
visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many
methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing
approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the
guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this
work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by
introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token
pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our
hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens
and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context.
Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves
performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal
accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these
gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and
inference latency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用Segment Anything Model (SAM)开发了一个专门用于监测孟加拉国河流侵蚀的AI模型，通过微调SAM的掩码解码器来识别河岸侵蚀特征，在历史Google Earth影像数据集上取得了86.30%的mIoU和92.60%的Dice分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国的大河流每年吞噬村庄和农田，造成大规模社区破坏和人口流离失所。传统的人工分析难以有效跟踪这种缓慢的灾难过程，需要自动化工具来精确监测河岸侵蚀。

Method: 首先使用简单的颜色通道分析进行粗略的土地和水域分割，然后微调SAM的掩码解码器来识别河岸侵蚀的细微特征。创建了包含2003-2025年历史Google Earth影像的新数据集，首次包含消失定居点的手动标注数据。

Result: 模型在河岸侵蚀检测方面表现出色，达到86.30%的平均交并比和92.60%的Dice分数，显著优于传统方法和现成的深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了三个关键贡献：首个因河流侵蚀而消失定居点的标注数据集、专门针对此关键任务微调的AI模型、以及通过视觉证据量化土地损失的方法，为政策制定者和灾害管理机构提供了监测侵蚀、预测轨迹和保护脆弱社区的新工具。

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also
agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and
vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing
thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now,
been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful
general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted
to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset
- a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of
Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur
Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially,
this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements
that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple
color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and
then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of
riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this
destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a
Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional
methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key
contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in
Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this
critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual
evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which
policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate
its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电竞比赛结果预测研究多基于比赛日志和统计数据，但针对需要复杂策略的FPS游戏VALORANT，需要更深入地分析比赛录像中的战术信息。

Method: 使用TimeSformer视频识别模型，从小地图信息中提取角色位置信息和游戏内事件等详细战术特征，构建回合结果预测模型。

Result: 在增强战术事件标签的数据集上训练的模型达到约81%的预测准确率，特别是在回合中后期阶段，显著优于仅使用小地图信息本身的模型。

Conclusion: 利用比赛录像中的战术特征对于预测VALORANT回合结果非常有效，特别是在回合中后期阶段。

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively
conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical
information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires
complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by
analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the
video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy
by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information,
such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper
reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented
with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy,
especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly
outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself.
This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly
effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

TL;DR: EndoCIL是一个专门为内窥镜图像诊断设计的类增量学习框架，通过三个关键组件解决领域差异和类别不平衡问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像分析需要模型能够持续适应新的临床数据，同时保持对已学习类别的性能。现有重放方法由于内窥镜图像中严重的领域差异和类别不平衡，无法有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出EndoCIL框架，包含三个组件：基于最大均值差异的重放选择多样代表性样本；先验正则化类别平衡损失缓解类间和类内不平衡；全连接梯度校准减轻对新类的偏置。

Result: 在四个公共内窥镜数据集上的实验表明，EndoCIL在不同缓冲区大小和评估指标下普遍优于最先进的CIL方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效平衡了终身内窥镜诊断中的稳定性和可塑性，在临床可扩展性和部署方面显示出良好潜力。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for endoscopic image analysis is crucial for
real-world clinical applications, where diagnostic models should continuously
adapt to evolving clinical data while retaining performance on previously
learned ones. However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively
mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class
imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we
propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for
endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum
Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy
strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized
Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and
intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and
balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected
Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward
new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets
demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods
across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework
effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis,
showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.

Motivation: 面部识别系统容易受到恶意攻击者使用注册用户照片进行欺骗攻击的威胁，需要在面部识别前检测此类欺骗攻击。

Method: 使用带寄存器的DINOv2提取可泛化特征，抑制注意力机制中的扰动，使注意力集中在关键细微特征上。

Result: 在ICCV2025第6届面部反欺骗研讨会提供的统一物理-数字攻击检测数据集和SiW数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于DINOv2的欺骗攻击检测方法能够有效区分真实和欺骗面部图像，提高面部识别系统的安全性。

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against variations in head
pose, illumination, and image blur during capture. However, malicious actors
can exploit these systems by presenting a face photo of a registered user,
potentially bypassing the authentication process. Such spoofing attacks must be
detected prior to face recognition. In this paper, we propose a DINOv2-based
spoofing attack detection method to discern minute differences between live and
spoofed face images. Specifically, we employ DINOv2 with registers to extract
generalizable features and to suppress perturbations in the attention
mechanism, which enables focused attention on essential and minute features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments
conducted on the dataset provided by ``The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop:
Unified Physical-Digital Attacks Detection@ICCV2025'' and SiW dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出VisiPruner框架，通过分析MLLMs的三阶段跨模态交互过程，实现无需训练的视觉token剪枝，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但由于注意力计算的二次增长导致计算开销巨大。现有方法缺乏对MLLMs处理多模态信息机制的根本理解。

Method: 通过系统分析发现MLLMs存在三阶段跨模态交互：浅层识别任务意图、中层关键视觉token驱动融合、深层专注语言精炼。基于此提出VisiPruner训练无关剪枝框架。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5 7B上减少99%视觉相关注意力计算和53.9% FLOPs，显著优于现有token剪枝方法，且适用于多种MLLMs。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLMs的层间处理动态，为训练高效MLLMs提供了架构设计指导，提出的VisiPruner框架有效解决了计算开销问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance
across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational
overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number
of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs,
\textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse
multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a
\textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers
recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks;
(2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few
critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely
on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose
\emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of
vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It
significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across
diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable
guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its
intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了多时刻检索任务，构建了QV-M^2数据集和FlashMMR框架，通过后验证模块优化时刻边界，在多项指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法主要关注单时刻检索，但现实应用中一个查询可能对应多个相关时刻，现有数据集和方法不足以应对视频时序定位的实际需求。

Method: 提出FlashMMR框架，包含多时刻后验证模块，通过约束时间调整和验证模块重新评估候选片段，过滤低置信度提议，实现鲁棒的多时刻对齐。

Result: 在QV-M^2数据集上，FlashMMR相比之前SOTA方法在G-mAP提升3.00%，mAP@3+tgt提升2.70%，mR@3提升2.56%。

Conclusion: QV-M^2数据集和FlashMMR方法为推进更现实和具有挑战性的视频时序定位研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval
(SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in
real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods
insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between
current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality
datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new
evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists
of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing
efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we
propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment
boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently
leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through
this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and
robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing
MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings.
Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and
evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically,
on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP,
2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method
establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging
video temporal grounding scenarios. Code is released at

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了深度伪造检测的公平性和可解释性，同时保持了高检测精度。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods often exhibit bias, lack transparency,
and fail to capture temporal information, leading to biased decisions and
unreliable results across different demographic groups. In this paper, we
propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal
feature learning and demographic-aware data augmentation to enhance fairness
and interpretability. Our method leverages sequence-based clustering for
temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve
detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for
non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data
augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies
frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby
mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on
FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets using state-of-the-art (SoTA)
architectures (Xception, ResNet) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in obtaining the best tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when
compared to SoTA.

Abstract: The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented
landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce
FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million
samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources
into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation
performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and
spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate
formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and
re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across
sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also
encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate
schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity.
Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing
open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of
scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release
the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset和nuScenes Dataset上验证，两个最先进的运动预测模型均获得一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: PnF利用MLLMs的零样本推理能力，为运动预测提供了一种实用且有效的增强方法。

Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving
and predicting motion, which demonstrate reliable performance in standard
conditions. However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world
scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion
forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on
the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and
handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We
design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill
this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior
prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance,
while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our
approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open
Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance
improvements across both benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in
microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many
hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability,
complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that
tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature
aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis.
SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and
guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone
(EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are
fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve
complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained
in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification
heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization
to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is
enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks,
allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the
framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting
consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN
and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual
contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers
a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in
clinical workflows.

Abstract: Effortless and ergonomically designed surgical lighting is critical for
precision and safety during procedures. However, traditional systems often rely
on manual adjustments, leading to surgeon fatigue, neck strain, and
inconsistent illumination due to drift and shadowing. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel surgical lighting system that leverages the
YOLOv11 object detection algorithm to identify a blue marker placed above the
target surgical site. A high-power LED light source is then directed to the
identified location using two servomotors equipped with tilt-pan brackets. The
YOLO model achieves 96.7% mAP@50 on the validation set consisting of annotated
images simulating surgical scenes with the blue spherical marker. By automating
the lighting process, this machine vision-based solution reduces physical
strain on surgeons, improves consistency in illumination, and supports improved
surgical outcomes.

Motivation: 观察到自监督学习中训练时间过长反而会降低密集预测任务性能的反常现象，需要解决无监督条件下评估密集任务性能的挑战。

Method: 提出了密集表示结构估计器(DSE)，包含类相关性度量和有效维度度量，用于无监督评估密集任务性能。基于DSE开发了模型选择策略和正则化方法。

Result: 在16种自监督方法和4个基准测试上的实验表明，模型选择策略平均提升mIoU 3.0%，计算成本可忽略；DSE正则化能持续缓解密集退化效应。

Conclusion: 自监督密集退化是普遍存在的现象，提出的DSE方法能有效无监督评估密集任务性能，相关策略显著改善模型性能。

Abstract: In this work, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon in self-supervised
learning (SSL): longer training may impair the performance of dense prediction
tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). We refer to this phenomenon as
Self-supervised Dense Degradation (SDD) and demonstrate its consistent presence
across sixteen state-of-the-art SSL methods with various losses, architectures,
and datasets. When the model performs suboptimally on dense tasks at the end of
training, measuring the performance during training becomes essential. However,
evaluating dense performance effectively without annotations remains an open
challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Dense representation Structure
Estimator (DSE), composed of a class-relevance measure and an effective
dimensionality measure. The proposed DSE is both theoretically grounded and
empirically validated to be closely correlated with the downstream performance.
Based on this metric, we introduce a straightforward yet effective model
selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Experiments on
sixteen SSL methods across four benchmarks confirm that model selection
improves mIoU by $3.0\%$ on average with negligible computational cost.
Additionally, DSE regularization consistently mitigates the effects of dense
degradation. Code is available at

### [133] [CausalMamba: Scalable Conditional State Space Models for Neural Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17318)
*Sangyoon Bae,Jiook Cha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalMamba是一个可扩展的fMRI因果推断框架，通过BOLD信号去卷积和条件Mamba架构解决神经因果推断的逆问题，在模拟数据上比DCM准确率高37%，在真实数据中能恢复88%的已知神经通路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决fMRI因果推断中的两个基本限制：从血氧动力学扭曲的BOLD信号推断神经因果关系的病态逆问题，以及现有方法（如动态因果建模DCM）的计算不可行性。

Method: 将复杂逆问题分解为两个可处理的阶段：BOLD去卷积恢复潜在神经活动，然后使用新颖的条件Mamba架构进行因果图推断。

Result: 在模拟数据上比DCM准确率高37%；在真实任务fMRI数据中恢复88%的已知神经通路，而传统方法在99%以上的受试者中无法识别这些典型回路；工作记忆数据分析显示大脑会根据刺激策略性地转移主要因果枢纽。

Conclusion: 为神经科学家提供了一个实用的工具，用于大规模因果推断，能够捕捉认知功能背后的基本回路模式和灵活网络动态。

Abstract: We introduce CausalMamba, a scalable framework that addresses fundamental
limitations in fMRI-based causal inference: the ill-posed nature of inferring
neural causality from hemodynamically distorted BOLD signals and the
computational intractability of existing methods like Dynamic Causal Modeling
(DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable
stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by
causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On
simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically,
when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established
neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to
identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our
network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically
shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks
depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains
undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a
practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental
circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了现有对抗防御方法对抗对抗性服装的有效性，发现这些防御在面对大尺寸、自然的对抗性服装时表现不佳，揭示了现有防御方法的共同漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验表明，仅仅扩大补丁尺寸就能使现有的对抗补丁防御方法失效。对抗性服装不仅尺寸大，而且在人体上看起来更自然，为评估补丁攻击防御提供了良好的测试案例。

Method: 通过制作对抗性服装来测试各种防御方法，包括在数字世界和物理世界中的评估。特别地，制作了一组能够突破Faster R-CNN上多个防御方法的对抗性服装。

Result: 所有防御方法在对抗对抗性服装时表现都很差。制作的一组对抗性服装在物理世界中，对未防御的检测器实现了96.06%的攻击成功率，对九个防御模型的攻击成功率均超过64.84%。

Conclusion: 现有对抗防御方法在面对对抗性服装时存在共同漏洞，表明需要开发更强大的防御机制来应对这种大尺寸、自然的物理世界对抗攻击。

Abstract: In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object
detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend
against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods
against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack.
However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make
these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense
methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human
body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense
against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also
look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the
defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the
digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of
clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over
64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the
common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against
adversarial clothes. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出CharDiff框架，通过字符级引导的扩散模型有效恢复和识别严重退化的车牌图像，在恢复质量和识别准确率上显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车牌图像恢复不仅对LPR系统预处理很重要，还能提高证据价值、增强视觉界面清晰度，促进车牌图像的进一步利用。

Method: 使用基于扩散的框架，通过外部分割和OCR模块提取细粒度字符级先验，并引入CHARM模块确保每个字符的引导仅限于自身区域。

Result: 在Roboflow-LP数据集上，相比最佳基线模型，CER相对减少28%，在恢复质量和识别准确率上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结构化字符引导条件化有效增强了基于扩散的车牌恢复和识别在实际部署场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the
preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also
serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the
clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license
plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level
guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded
license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages
fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license
plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel
Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which
ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby
avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff
significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration
quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on
the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These
results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively
enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and
recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) has progressed from scalar quality prediction
to more interpretable, human-aligned evaluation paradigms. In this work, we
address the emerging challenge of detailed and explainable IQA by proposing
iDETEX-a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of
simultaneously performing three key tasks: quality grounding, perception, and
description. To facilitate efficient and generalizable training across these
heterogeneous subtasks, we design a suite of task-specific offline augmentation
modules and a data mixing strategy. These are further complemented by online
enhancement strategies to fully exploit multi-sourced supervision. We validate
our approach on the large-scale ViDA-UGC benchmark, where iDETEX achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks. Our model ranks first in the
ICCV MIPI 2025 Detailed Image Quality Assessment Challenge, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in delivering accurate and interpretable quality
assessments.

TL;DR: 提出一种后处理开放集识别方法，通过比较模型特征与预测logits之间的一致性来识别未知类别，无需重新训练预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前野生动物分类模型在封闭世界设定下训练，当遇到未知类别时会过度自信。现有OSR方法大多需要重新训练模型，这限制了实用性。

Method: 基于输入到最近类别均值的距离构建概率分布，然后将该分布与softmax概率进行比较，测量NCM与分类头之间的一致性。

Result: 在两个评估数据集上排名前三，AUROC分别达到93.41（非洲动物）和95.35（瑞典动物），性能稳定优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的后处理OSR方法无需重新训练模型，在多个数据集上表现一致且优于现有方法，为开放集识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the
closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain
overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify
known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been
proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit,
or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing
approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model
with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR
method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted
logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to
its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with
the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the
NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top
three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two
datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single
dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish
animals. The code can be found

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-E2VID框架，通过跨模态特征对齐和语义感知特征融合，将视觉语义知识从图像模态迁移到事件模态，显著提升了事件到视频重建的质量和语义信息恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机仅捕捉强度变化，忽略静态对象和背景，导致捕获的事件模态缺乏语义信息。现有E2V方法往往忽视语义信息在视频重建中的关键作用。

Method: 1) 跨模态特征对齐模块将Segment Anything Model的视觉语义迁移到事件编码器；2) 语义感知特征融合块整合学习到的语义特征；3) 语义感知E2V监督利用SAM生成的类别标签辅助重建语义细节。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升帧质量，优于最先进的E2V方法。

Conclusion: Semantic-E2VID通过有效利用视觉语义知识，成功解决了事件模态缺乏语义信息的问题，为事件到视频重建提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic
range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction
(E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly
for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due
to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes,
ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic
information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a
crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by
existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V
framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality
and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,
Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to
transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation
model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning
the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned
semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)
block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event
representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.
Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a
novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct
semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame
quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks.
The sample code is included in the supplementary material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘设备上部署实时空间感知需要高效的多任务模型，能够利用互补任务信息同时最小化计算开销。

Method: 提出窗口跨任务注意力模块，在轻量级ViT-based DINOv2骨干网络上实现结构化特征交换，保持任务特定细节。

Result: 在NYUDv2数据集上超越最先进的多任务模型，在Hypersim上超过单任务深度和语义基线，在Cityscapes上表现优异，同时在笔记本电脑硬件上保持计算效率。

Conclusion: M2H为单目空间感知系统提供了实用基础，支持动态环境中的3D场景图构建，并在真实世界数据上验证了其实用性。

Abstract: Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient
multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing
computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel
multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth,
edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared
encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task
Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving
task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on
a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time
deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception
systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments.
Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task
models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on
Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all
while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond
benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality
in spatial perception tasks.

Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs在流式场景中处理小时级长视频时面临效率挑战，需要及时响应查询但无法完全访问视频。

Method: 1) 基于LLM注意力选择重要视觉token；2) 递归处理历史选择token；3) 基于标题的轻量级问答。

Result: 能够丢弃约95%的不重要视觉token，在流式视频基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和效果之间取得了良好平衡，适用于流式视频理解场景。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding videos
in-context, provided they have full access to the video when answering queries.
However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long
videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this
work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs,
leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to
identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its
understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to
discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss;
2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent
understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for
lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between
efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: 合成人脸数据是科学可行且伦理必要的替代方案，既能保证高识别准确率，又能提供隐私保护和偏见缓解能力。

Abstract: The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:
achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected
without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities
under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising
privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical
evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through
extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a
systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition
datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our
methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic
data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity
separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and
benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic
samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard
benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of
synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic
datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and
94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including
CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available
alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our
findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while
maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even
though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control
for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish
synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative
alternative for facial recognition research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于多面部表情特征融合和自适应类别平衡策略的帕金森病严重程度诊断方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于面部表情的PD诊断方法依赖单一表情易误诊，忽略不同PD阶段的类别不平衡问题，且大多只进行二元分类而非严重程度诊断

Method: 通过注意力机制融合多种面部表情特征，并采用自适应类别平衡策略动态调整训练样本贡献度

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在PD严重程度诊断方面表现优异，注意力特征融合和自适应类别平衡策略有效

Conclusion: 提出的多表情特征融合和自适应平衡方法能有效提升PD严重程度诊断性能

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting
potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on
facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains
growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However,
current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of
expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance
across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover,
most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather
than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new
facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates
multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion.
Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class
balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training
samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty.
Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based
feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

TL;DR: 提出LoopTrans闭环框架，通过双向知识转移（从外中心到自我中心，再返回增强外中心知识）来改进弱监督功能基础任务，解决了传统单向转移在复杂交互场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过观察他人与物体的互动就能学会与新颖物体交互，但现有弱监督功能基础方法仅从外中心图像单向转移到自我中心图像，限制了在复杂交互场景中的应用。

Method: LoopTrans闭环框架，包含统一跨模态定位和去噪知识蒸馏机制，桥接以物体为中心的自我中心图像和以交互为中心的外中心图像之间的领域差距。

Result: 在图像和视频基准测试中所有指标均取得一致改进，甚至能处理物体交互区域完全被人遮挡的挑战性场景。

Conclusion: LoopTrans通过双向知识转移显著提升了弱监督功能基础任务的性能，证明了闭环框架在复杂交互场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Humans can perform previously unexperienced interactions with novel objects
simply by observing others engage with them. Weakly-supervised affordance
grounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable
actions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with
image-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from
exocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the
applicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this
study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only
transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to
enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative
mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and
denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered
egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that LoopTrans achieves consistent improvements
across all metrics on image and video benchmarks, even handling challenging
scenarios where object interaction regions are fully occluded by the human
body.

Conclusion: 这项工作为马场实时行为监测奠定了基础，对动物福利和厩舍管理具有重要意义。

Abstract: Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of
health and welfare issues but remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. In
this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that
automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using
object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages
YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are
inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall.
To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with
assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system
distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind
spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for
horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to
data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral
monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and
stable management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统关键点检测器（SIFT、SURF等）和学习方法（SuperPoint等）存在对光度变化敏感、关键点密度低、可重复性差、适应性有限以及缺乏语义理解等问题。

Method: 首先融合7种关键点和2种边缘检测器的输出创建真实掩码，提取多样视觉特征；然后使用轻量高效的ESPNet模型训练，使DeepDetect能够语义关注图像并生成密集关键点。

Result: 在Oxford Affine Covariant Regions数据集上，DeepDetect在关键点密度（0.5143）、可重复性（0.9582）和正确匹配数（59,003）方面均超越其他检测器。

Conclusion: DeepDetect通过融合传统检测器和深度学习，实现了在视觉退化条件下高密度、高可重复性的关键点检测，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including
image registration, structure-from motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry,
and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning
based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong
performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric
changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to
challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to
prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent,
all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical
detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing
outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from
corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a
lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as
labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing
highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded
conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset
demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,
repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of
0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003
(correct matches).

Result: 在117帧视频上成功注册所有图像并重建46-62万个点，重投影误差0.51-0.53像素，匹配密度与BA时间呈正相关。

Conclusion: 压缩域对应关系是实用且资源高效的前端解决方案，具有在完整流程中扩展的明确路径。

Abstract: We repurpose AV1 motion vectors to produce dense sub-pixel correspondences
and short tracks filtered by cosine consistency. On short videos, this
compressed-domain front end runs comparably to sequential SIFT while using far
less CPU, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. As a
small SfM demo on a 117-frame clip, MV matches register all images and
reconstruct 0.46-0.62M points at 0.51-0.53,px reprojection error; BA time grows
with match density. These results show compressed-domain correspondences are a
practical, resource-efficient front end with clear paths to scaling in full
pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个高质量夜间图像去雨基准数据集HQ-NightRain，并开发了颜色空间转换网络CST-Net，通过可学习的颜色空间转换器和隐式光照引导来有效去除夜间复杂雨纹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像去雨比白天更具挑战性，主要由于夜间场景的固有复杂性以及缺乏高质量数据集来准确表示雨和光照的耦合效应。

Method: 开发了颜色空间转换网络CST-Net，包含可学习的颜色空间转换器来在Y通道更好地去除雨纹，并引入隐式光照引导来捕获光照信息以提高模型在复杂场景中的鲁棒性。

Result: 大量实验证明了所提出数据集的价值和方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的HQ-NightRain数据集和CST-Net方法在夜间图像去雨任务中表现出色，为这一具有挑战性的问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Compared to daytime image deraining, nighttime image deraining poses
significant challenges due to inherent complexities of nighttime scenarios and
the lack of high-quality datasets that accurately represent the coupling effect
between rain and illumination. In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime
image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain,
which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In
addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net)
for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we
propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain
removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel
compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for
guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced
enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex
scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the
effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available at

*Feng Zhou,Wenkai Guo,Pu Cao,Zhicheng Zhang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进稀疏视图3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)初始化的方法，通过频率感知SfM、3DGS自初始化和点云正则化来解决稀疏视图下的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图3DGS容易对训练视图过拟合，导致新视角渲染出现模糊等伪影。现有方法通过改进初始化或添加训练时约束来解决，但研究发现初始化是决定性因素，决定了性能上限。

Method: 1) 频率感知SfM：通过低频视图增强和宽松多视图对应提升低纹理区域覆盖；2) 3DGS自初始化：将光度监督提升为额外点，用学习的高斯中心补偿SfM稀疏区域；3) 点云正则化：通过几何/可见性先验确保多视图一致性和均匀空间覆盖。

Result: 在LLFF和Mip-NeRF360数据集上的实验表明，该方法在稀疏视图设置下取得了持续的性能提升，成为更强的初始化策略。

Conclusion: 初始化是稀疏视图3DGS的关键因素，提出的方法通过改进SfM初始化、自初始化和正则化，显著提升了稀疏视图下的渲染质量。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training
views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work
addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point
cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints
(regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal
that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable
performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield
only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's
primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse
views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed
points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it
fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i)
frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view
augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS
self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points,
compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii)
point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform
spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean
and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate
consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a
stronger initialization strategy. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有占用世界模型依赖静态固定嵌入或网格，限制了感知灵活性，且其"原地分类"方法与真实场景的动态连续性存在潜在不匹配。

Method: 使用稀疏动态查询，包含范围自适应感知模块（通过车辆状态调制可学习查询）和状态条件预测模块（用回归引导公式替代基于分类的预测），并设计了时间感知自调度训练策略。

Result: 在感知、预测和规划任务上达到最先进性能，验证了模型在灵活性、适应性和效率方面的优势。

Conclusion: SparseWorld通过稀疏动态查询实现了灵活、自适应且高效的4D占用世界建模，在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models
for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing
occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which
inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place
classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic
and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld,
a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient,
powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception
module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and
enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range
perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a
State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based
forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic
queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically
devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and
efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves
state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning
tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the
advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and
efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/MSunDYY/SparseWorld.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POTNet通过熵引导的双聚类头和最优传输改进原型生成，AutoSOD实现端到端无监督显著目标检测，性能接近全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测(SOD)作为计算机视觉基础任务，作者认为无需像素级标签也能达到接近监督学习的精度，但需要可靠的伪掩码。现有原型方法存在边界和内部像素几何特性差异、最优传输在弱原型下利用不足的问题。

Method: 提出POTNet：1）熵引导双聚类头：高熵像素用谱聚类，低熵像素用k-means；2）两组原型通过最优传输对齐；3）生成的伪掩码监督标准MaskFormer编码器-解码器，形成AutoSOD端到端无监督管道。

Result: 在5个基准测试中，AutoSOD在F-measure上比无监督方法提升26%，比弱监督方法提升36%，进一步缩小了与全监督模型的差距。

Conclusion: split-fuse-transport设计能在单次前向传播中生成更清晰、部分感知的伪掩码，无需手工先验，实现了高效准确的无监督显著目标检测。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment visually prominent regions in
images and serves as a foundational task for various computer vision
applications. We posit that SOD can now reach near-supervised accuracy without
a single pixel-level label, but only when reliable pseudo-masks are available.
We revisit the prototype-based line of work and make two key observations.
First, boundary pixels and interior pixels obey markedly different geometry;
second, the global consistency enforced by optimal transport (OT) is
underutilized if prototype quality is weak. To address this, we introduce
POTNet, an adaptation of Prototypical Optimal Transport that replaces POT's
single k-means step with an entropy-guided dual-clustering head: high-entropy
pixels are organized by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means, and
the two prototype sets are subsequently aligned by OT. This
split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single
forward pass, without handcrafted priors. Those masks supervise a standard
MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder, giving rise to AutoSOD, an end-to-end
unsupervised SOD pipeline that eliminates SelfMask's offline voting yet
improves both accuracy and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks show that AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and
weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, further narrowing the gap
to fully supervised models.

*Yuanli Wu,Long Zhang,Yue Du,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于评分标准引导的伪标签提示框架，将少量真实标注转化为高置信度伪标签，构建结构化、数据集自适应的评分标准来指导可解释的场景评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督方法标注成本高且跨数据集泛化能力有限，无监督方法难以捕捉高级语义和细粒度叙事线索，零样本提示方法对人工提示模板和数据集特定分数归一化高度敏感。

Method: 使用评分标准引导的伪标签提示框架，将少量真实标注转化为伪标签并聚合成评分标准。推理时基于描述对首尾片段评分，中间片段则结合相邻场景的上下文摘要来评估叙事进展和冗余度。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上分别达到57.58和63.05的F1分数，超越了无监督和先前的零样本基线方法，接近监督方法的性能。

Conclusion: 评分标准引导的伪标签有效稳定了基于LLM的评分，为视频摘要建立了一个通用、可解释的零样本范式。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media,
surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into
concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital.
Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from
dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset
generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to
capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More
recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models
(LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to
handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled
prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations
into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured,
dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During
inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their
descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries
of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This
contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global
coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1
scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior
zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results
demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based
scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video
summarization.

Motivation: 大规模视频生成模型训练面临跨模态对齐、长序列和复杂时空依赖等挑战，需要高效训练框架来解决资源密集型问题。

Method: 优化四个关键支柱：数据处理、模型架构、训练策略和基础设施，包括数据预处理、视频压缩、参数缩放、课程预训练和对齐后训练。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了视频生成模型的训练效率和性能，开源完整训练堆栈为社区提供了首个基于Megatron-Core的大规模视频生成训练代码。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content
(\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable
progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains
particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video
alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that
optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii)
training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation
models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and
performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video
compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and
alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent
state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video
generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations.
More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights,
Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for
video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public
release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits
Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node
scaling, details are available in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MambaX-Net，一种用于前列腺癌主动监测的半监督双扫描3D分割架构，通过利用先前时间点的MRI和分割掩码来改进当前时间点的分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习分割模型通常基于单时间点和专家标注数据训练，不适用于纵向主动监测分析，因为存在多个时间点和专家标签稀缺的问题。

Method: MambaX-Net包含两个新组件：Mamba增强的交叉注意力模块（用于捕捉时间演化和长距离空间依赖）和形状提取器模块（将先前分割掩码编码为潜在解剖表示）。采用半监督自训练策略，利用预训练nnU-Net生成的伪标签进行学习。

Result: 在纵向主动监测数据集上的评估显示，MambaX-Net显著优于最先进的U-Net和Transformer模型，即使在有限和噪声数据下也能实现优越的前列腺区域分割。

Conclusion: MambaX-Net为解决纵向主动监测中的分割挑战提供了一种有效解决方案，能够在专家标注稀缺的情况下实现准确的前列腺分割。

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while
monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up.
Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating
this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However,
existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on
single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for
longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert
labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation
architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the
MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We
introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module,
which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture
temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape
Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent
anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a
semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated
from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert
annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results
showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and
Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even
when trained on limited and noisy data.

Motivation: 为了减少对昂贵像素级标注的依赖，开发一种仅需图像级标签的弱监督道路裂缝检测方法，以支持智能城市基础设施维护。

Method: 提出WP-CrackNet框架，包含三个组件：分类器生成类激活图、重建器测量特征可推断性、检测器输出像素级结果。通过对抗学习使裂缝CAM覆盖完整区域，使用路径感知注意力模块融合高低层特征，并提出中心增强CAM一致性模块优化伪标签生成。

Result: 在三个图像级数据集上的实验表明，WP-CrackNet达到与监督方法相当的结果，优于现有弱监督方法，显著推进了可扩展道路检测。

Conclusion: WP-CrackNet通过弱监督学习有效解决了道路裂缝检测问题，减少了标注成本，为智能基础设施维护提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Road crack detection is essential for intelligent infrastructure maintenance
in smart cities. To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations, we
propose WP-CrackNet, an end-to-end weakly-supervised method that trains with
only image-level labels for pixel-wise crack detection. WP-CrackNet integrates
three components: a classifier generating class activation maps (CAMs), a
reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing
pixel-wise road crack detection results. During training, the classifier and
reconstructor alternate in adversarial learning to encourage crack CAMs to
cover complete crack regions, while the detector learns from pseudo labels
derived from post-processed crack CAMs. This mutual feedback among the three
components improves learning stability and detection accuracy. To further boost
detection performance, we design a path-aware attention module (PAAM) that
fuses high-level semantics from the classifier with low-level structural cues
from the reconstructor by modeling spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Additionally, a center-enhanced CAM consistency module (CECCM) is proposed to
refine crack CAMs using center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints,
enabling better pseudo-label generation. We create three image-level datasets
and extensive experiments show that WP-CrackNet achieves comparable results to
supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods,
significantly advancing scalable road inspection. The source code package and
datasets are available at https://mias.group/WP-CrackNet/.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的3D前馈模型（如VGGT）在静态场景中表现良好，但在包含复杂动态元素（如移动人物或可变形物体）的真实世界场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出动态感知聚合器，通过预测动态感知掩码来解耦静态和动态信息：抑制运动线索用于姿态估计，增强运动线索用于几何重建。

Result: PAGE-4D在动态场景中持续优于原始VGGT，在相机姿态估计、单目和视频深度估计以及密集点云重建方面取得更优结果。

Conclusion: PAGE-4D成功解决了4D重建中多任务间的固有冲突，为动态场景的3D属性推断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent 3D feed-forward models, such as the Visual Geometry Grounded
Transformer (VGGT), have shown strong capability in inferring 3D attributes of
static scenes. However, since they are typically trained on static datasets,
these models often struggle in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamic
elements, such as moving humans or deformable objects like umbrellas. To
address this limitation, we introduce PAGE-4D, a feedforward model that extends
VGGT to dynamic scenes, enabling camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and
point cloud reconstruction -- all without post-processing. A central challenge
in multi-task 4D reconstruction is the inherent conflict between tasks:
accurate camera pose estimation requires suppressing dynamic regions, while
geometry reconstruction requires modeling them. To resolve this tension, we
propose a dynamics-aware aggregator that disentangles static and dynamic
information by predicting a dynamics-aware mask -- suppressing motion cues for
pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in
dynamic scenarios, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation,
monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

Result: 在提出的UCIS4K数据集和公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，UCIS-SAM优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了水下伪装实例分割的挑战，为水下视觉任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection,
underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater
environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring,
camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately
segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional
camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated
datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in
underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater
camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which
comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level
annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance
Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM
includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module
(CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning,
effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater
environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is
proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from
camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged
objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature
Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries
of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands,
improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of
camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public
benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D generation from natural language offers significant potential to reduce
expert manual modeling efforts and enhance accessibility to 3D assets. However,
existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor
interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these
limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft,
a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we
propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes
complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby
facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial
relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents
hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine
procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and
interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate
ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and
semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further
show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and
user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive
applications.

Abstract: The advancement of UAV technology has enabled efficient, non-contact
structural health monitoring. Combined with photogrammetry, UAVs can capture
high-resolution scans and reconstruct detailed 3D models of infrastructure.
However, a key challenge remains in segmenting specific structural components
from these models-a process traditionally reliant on time-consuming and
error-prone manual labeling. To address this issue, we propose a machine
learning-based framework for automated segmentation of 3D point clouds. Our
approach uses the complementary strengths of real-world UAV-scanned point
clouds and synthetic data generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
overcome the limitations associated with manual labeling. Validation on a
railroad track dataset demonstrated high accuracy in identifying and segmenting
major components such as rails and crossties. Moreover, by using smaller-scale
datasets supplemented with BIM data, the framework significantly reduced
training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation accuracy. This
automated approach improves the precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure
model segmentation and advances the integration of UAV and BIM technologies in
structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dinomaly2是一个统一的图像异常检测框架，通过五个简单元素的组合在标准重建框架中实现卓越性能，填补了多类模型与先进单类模型之间的性能差距，并扩展到多种数据模态和任务设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多类异常检测模型性能显著落后于最先进的单类模型，且该领域已分裂为针对特定场景的专业方法，造成部署障碍，需要统一的解决方案。

Method: 基于"少即是多"理念，在标准重建框架中协调五个简单元素，这种简约设计使其能够自然地扩展到各种任务而无需修改。

Result: 在12个异常检测基准测试中，Dinomaly2在多种模态（2D、多视图、RGB-3D、RGB-IR）、任务设置（单类、多类、推理统一多类、少样本）和应用领域（工业、生物、户外）均表现出全谱系优势。多类模型在MVTec-AD和VisA上分别达到99.9%和99.3%的图像级AUROC。

Conclusion: Dinomaly2通过简约设计、计算可扩展性和通用适用性的结合，成为现实世界异常检测应用的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has evolved from building specialized
single-class models to unified multi-class models, yet existing multi-class
models significantly underperform the most advanced one-for-one counterparts.
Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to
specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment
barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we
present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD,
which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly
extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less
is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple
element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based
framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across
diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the
foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks
demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities
(2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class,
inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial,
biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented
99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For
multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples
per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and
97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design,
computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a
unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection
applications.

*Frédéric LIN,Biruk Abere Ambaw,Adrian Popescu,Hejer Ammar,Romaric Audigier,Hervé Le Borgne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaMiT数据集包含78.7万标注样本和510万未标注样本，涵盖190种汽车型号（2007-2023），用于研究视觉系统的时序适应能力。研究发现静态预训练在跨年测试时性能下降，提出时间增量分类和生成方法提升时序鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统需要适应不断演化的视觉环境，特别是在物体外观随时间变化的领域。汽车型号作为技术产品的代表类别，其外观演化提供了研究时序适应的理想场景。

Method: 1) 构建CaMiT时序数据集；2) 评估静态预训练在跨年测试中的性能；3) 提出时间增量分类设置，包括更新主干网络的时间增量预训练和仅更新最后一层的时间增量分类器学习；4) 探索利用时序元数据的时间感知图像生成。

Result: 静态预训练在域内数据上能达到与大规模通用模型竞争的性能且更高效，但在跨年测试时准确率下降。时间增量预训练和时间增量分类器学习都能提升时序鲁棒性。时间感知图像生成能产生更真实的输出。

Conclusion: CaMiT为研究细粒度视觉识别和生成中的时序适应提供了丰富的基准，时间增量学习方法能有效应对现实世界中的类别出现、演化和消失问题。

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains
where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time
(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,
a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled
samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),
supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on
in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist
models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models
are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental
classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,
evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:
time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental
classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving
temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that
leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.
CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained
visual recognition and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DINO-CV框架，使用高分辨率LiDAR DEM和自监督跨视图预训练策略，解决植被遮挡和标注数据稀缺问题，实现干石墙的自动分割映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干石墙具有重要遗产和环境价值，但许多因难以接近和手动测绘成本高而未被识别。深度学习方法面临视觉遮挡和标注数据有限两大挑战。

Method: 使用LiDAR DEM克服植被遮挡，提出基于知识蒸馏的自监督跨视图预训练策略，学习多DEM衍生物的视觉和几何表征，支持多种视觉骨干网络。

Result: 在澳大利亚Budj Bim UNESCO世界遗产地应用，测试区域mIoU达68.6%，仅用10%标注数据微调后仍保持63.8% mIoU。

Conclusion: 自监督学习结合高分辨率DEM衍生物，在植被茂密、标注稀缺的遗产环境中实现干石墙自动映射具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Dry-stone walls hold significant heritage and environmental value. Mapping
these structures is essential for ecosystem preservation and wildfire
management in Australia. Yet, many walls remain unidentified due to their
inaccessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based
segmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1)
visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited
labeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation
framework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using
high-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs
overcome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath
vegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV
introduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on
knowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual
and geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting
various vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision
Transformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj
Bim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of
colonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves
a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains
63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM
derivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich
environments with scarce annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较了两种节俭联邦学习方法用于暴力检测：基于视觉语言模型(VLM)的零样本/联邦微调与个性化训练紧凑3D CNN。在非IID设置下评估准确性、校准和能耗，发现两种方法都超过90%准确率，CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优且能耗更低，而VLM在上下文推理和多模态推断方面更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究节俭联邦学习方法用于暴力检测，特别关注能源效率和环境指标，为视频监控中的负责任、资源感知AI提供可复现基线。

Method: 使用LLaVA-7B和65.8M参数CNN3D作为代表案例，比较两种策略：(i)视觉语言模型的零样本和联邦微调，(ii)个性化训练紧凑3D卷积神经网络。在非IID设置下评估准确性、校准和能耗。

Result: 两种方法都超过90%准确率。CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优于LoRA调优的VLM，且能耗更低。VLM在上下文推理和多模态推断方面保持优势。量化了训练和推断过程中的能耗和CO2排放。

Conclusion: 支持混合模型：轻量级CNN用于常规分类，选择性激活VLM用于复杂或描述性场景。该框架为视频监控中的负责任、资源感知AI提供了可复现基线，可扩展到实时、多模态和生命周期感知系统。

Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by
comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning
of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact
3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter
CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy
usage under realistic non-IID settings.
  Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy. CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank
Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and log loss, while using less energy.
VLMs remain favorable for contextual reasoning and multimodal inference. We
quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions across training and inference, and analyze
sustainability trade-offs for deployment.
  To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned
vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection,
with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics.
  These findings support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine
classification, with selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive
scenarios. The resulting framework offers a reproducible baseline for
responsible, resource-aware AI in video surveillance, with extensions toward
real-time, multimodal, and lifecycle-aware systems.

*Ling Liu,Jun Tian,Li Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DSegStreamer是一个用于4D全景分割的流式处理框架，采用双线程系统处理动态环境中的实时细粒度感知，可集成到现有3D/4D分割方法中实现实时能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高度动态环境中（如密集人群疏散、复杂自动驾驶场景），需要在有限时间预算内实现实时、细粒度的感知，这对4D全景分割的流式处理提出了关键需求。

Method: 采用双线程系统：预测线程利用历史运动和几何信息提取特征并预测未来动态；推理线程通过对齐最新内存并补偿自运动和动态物体移动，确保对输入帧的及时预测。

Result: 在室内HOI4D数据集和室外SemanticKITTI、nuScenes数据集上的综合实验表明，该方法在复杂场景中准确预测动态物体方面表现优异，特别是在高FPS条件下比现有流式感知方法更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 4DSegStreamer是一个通用且高效的流式处理框架，能够显著提升4D全景分割在动态环境中的实时性能，为复杂场景下的感知任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 4D panoptic segmentation in a streaming setting is critical for highly
dynamic environments, such as evacuating dense crowds and autonomous driving in
complex scenarios, where real-time, fine-grained perception within a
constrained time budget is essential. In this paper, we introduce
4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to
efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be
seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable
real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to
existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS
conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread.
The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to
extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures
timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and
compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate
4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and
nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex
scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PICABench基准测试，用于系统评估图像编辑的物理真实性，涵盖光学、力学和状态转换等8个子维度，并开发了PICAEval评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型主要关注指令完成度，但忽视了编辑操作伴随的物理效果（如阴影、反射等），这影响了生成的真实性。

Method: 构建PICABench基准测试，提出PICAEval评估协议（使用VLM作为评判者），并创建PICA-100K训练数据集从视频中学习物理知识。

Result: 评估主流模型后发现，物理真实性仍是一个具有挑战性的问题，存在很大改进空间。

Conclusion: 该研究为从简单内容编辑向物理一致性真实感的转变提供了基础，希望推动未来研究关注物理真实性问题。

Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing
models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original
content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying
physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing
an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with
nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on
instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,
how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we
introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across
eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for
most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We
further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses
VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.
Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics
from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most
of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a
challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and
proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive
content editing toward physically consistent realism.

Method: 1) 构建基础专家、语义专家和自适应专家，采用像素概率自适应投票策略进行专家选择和融合；2) 提出语义引导对比学习方法解决对比学习中弱监督问题。

Conclusion: IC-MoE成功补充了基础医学图像分割模型的高层特征和预训练结构完整性，并在多样化医学图像分割场景中展现出优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable
performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation
models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some
limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient
representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical
problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts
boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold
ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts.
Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which
enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load
balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability
of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained
weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address
the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further
enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across
three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE
outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively
supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level
features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior
generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation
scenarios.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像行人检索中的模态异质性问题，现有方法要么忽略细粒度差异，要么需要先验信息进行局部对齐，且当前方法主要针对英语，限制了在多语言环境中的应用。

Method: 提出Bi-IRRA框架，包含双向隐式关系推理模块（通过掩码图像和文本的双向预测来隐式增强跨语言和跨模态的局部关系建模）和多维全局对齐模块（桥接模态异质性）。

Result: 该方法在所有多语言TIPR数据集上都取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: Bi-IRRA框架通过双向隐式关系推理和多维全局对齐，有效解决了多语言文本到图像行人检索中的模态异质性问题，为多语言环境下的行人检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person
using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior
works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local
alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained
cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to
explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are
English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To
alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a
multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for
initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge.
Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation
Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and
modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module
enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing
the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a
multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality
heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all
multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in
https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/Bi-IRRA.

Motivation: 现有3D物体检测方法在开放世界场景中泛化能力不足，传统闭集检测器无法处理未见物体，而直接使用3D开放词汇模型又面临词汇扩展和语义重叠问题。

Method: 提出OP3Det方法，利用2D基础模型的强泛化能力，结合2D语义先验和3D几何先验生成类别无关的候选区域，通过跨模态专家混合动态路由单模态和多模态特征来学习广义3D物体性。

Conclusion: OP3Det通过结合2D基础模型和跨模态融合，成功实现了广义3D物体发现，在开放世界3D检测任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object detection and novel category detection have
made significant progress, yet research on learning generalized 3D objectness
remains insufficient. In this paper, we delve into learning open-world 3D
objectness, which focuses on detecting all objects in a 3D scene, including
novel objects unseen during training. Traditional closed-set 3D detectors
struggle to generalize to open-world scenarios, while directly incorporating 3D
open-vocabulary models for open-world ability struggles with vocabulary
expansion and semantic overlap. To achieve generalized 3D object discovery, We
propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic Open-World Prompt-free 3D Detector to detect
any objects within 3D scenes without relying on hand-crafted text prompts. We
introduce the strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation
models, utilizing both 2D semantic priors and 3D geometric priors for
class-agnostic proposals to broaden 3D object discovery. Then, by integrating
complementary information from point cloud and RGB image in the cross-modal
mixture of experts, OP3Det dynamically routes uni-modal and multi-modal
features to learn generalized 3D objectness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the extraordinary performance of OP3Det, which significantly surpasses existing
open-world 3D detectors by up to 16.0% in AR and achieves a 13.5% improvement
compared to closed-world 3D detectors.

Conclusion: 广义对抗求解器提供了一种简单有效的扩散模型加速采样方案，在保持生成质量的同时显著减少计算开销。

Abstract: While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they
still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this
issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE
diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of
function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often
rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving
fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a
simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional
training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further
combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which
mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method
the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource
constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve remarkable performance but are only
available in a limited set of pre-determined sizes, forcing sub-optimal
deployment choices under real-world constraints. We introduce SnapViT:
Single-shot network approximation for pruned Vision Transformers, a new
post-pretraining structured pruning method that enables elastic inference
across a continuum of compute budgets. Our approach efficiently combines
gradient information with cross-network structure correlations, approximated
via an evolutionary algorithm, does not require labeled data, generalizes to
models without a classification head, and is retraining-free. Experiments on
DINO, SigLIPv2, DeIT, and AugReg models demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across various sparsities, requiring less than five
minutes on a single A100 GPU to generate elastic models that can be adjusted to
any computational budget. Our key contributions include an efficient pruning
strategy for pretrained Vision Transformers, a novel evolutionary approximation
of Hessian off-diagonal structures, and a self-supervised importance scoring
mechanism that maintains strong performance without requiring retraining or

Motivation: 现有帕金森病早期检测方法存在两个主要局限：数据集不足和处理未见患者数据时鲁棒性差。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段按绘图类型分类，第二阶段将图像分为2x2块，分别提取特征并使用集成方法进行最终分类。

Conclusion: 分块策略和集成方法有效提高了帕金森病检测的鲁棒性，特别是在处理未见患者数据时表现优异。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of
people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand
coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried
to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images;
however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack
of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient
data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease
that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing
type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required
features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the
previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each
image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting
features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final
classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from
each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top
performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On
the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen
patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap
of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in
prior work.

Abstract: Circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) containing red blood cells (RBCs),
white blood cells(WBCs), and platelets are significant biomarkers linked to
conditions like thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Flow cytometry, paired
with fluorescence staining, is commonly used to analyze these cell clusters,
revealing cell morphology and protein profiles. While computational approaches
based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell
flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to
automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell
clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell
clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel
staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study
introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and
identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis
strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups
by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT).
Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from
multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and
staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster
classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated
framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both
bright-field and fluorescence data. Initially tested on blood cells, it holds
potential for broader applications, such as analyzing immune and tumor cell
clusters, supporting cellular research across various diseases.

*Zhiqiang Teng,Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Zifeng Yuan,Xuanyi Li,Xuanyu Zhang,Shunli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaindropGS是一个针对3D高斯溅射(3DGS)在雨滴条件下的综合基准测试，评估从无约束雨滴污染图像到清晰3DGS重建的完整流程，揭示了现有方法在真实雨滴图像上的性能局限性和不同流程组件的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常使用具有已知相机姿态的合成雨滴图像评估3DGS，假设理想条件。但在真实场景中，雨滴会干扰准确的相机姿态估计和点云初始化，且合成与真实雨滴之间存在显著领域差距，影响泛化能力。

Method: RaindropGS基准包含三个部分：数据准备、数据处理和雨滴感知的3DGS评估。收集真实世界雨滴重建数据集，每个场景包含三种对齐图像集：雨滴聚焦、背景聚焦和无雨地面真实图像，以全面评估不同聚焦条件下的重建质量。

Result: 通过综合实验和分析，揭示了现有3DGS方法在无约束雨滴图像上的性能局限性，以及不同流程组件的不同影响：相机聚焦位置对3DGS重建性能的影响，以及不准确的姿态和点云初始化对重建的干扰。

Conclusion: 这些见解为在雨滴条件下开发更鲁棒的3DGS方法确立了明确方向，RaindropGS基准提供了评估完整3DGS流程的全面框架。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe
occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the
camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing
benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known
camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in
real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap
between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle
these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images
to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline
consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware
3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal
comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world
raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned
image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth,
enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different
focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal
critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on
unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline
components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction
performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud
initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for
developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.

Abstract: The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question
answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video

extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source
MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in
handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available
to foster future research.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨签名伪造检测的特征学习策略，重点关注提高跨数据集泛化能力。使用三个公共基准数据集，开发了基于原始签名图像和基于壳预处理的两种实验流程。结果显示原始图像模型在跨基准测试中表现更好，而基于壳的模型显示出未来改进的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线签名验证中的深度学习方法在跨数据集泛化方面仍存在困难，手写风格和采集协议的差异会降低性能。本研究旨在改进签名伪造检测的跨数据集泛化能力。

Method: 使用CEDAR、ICDAR和GPDS Synthetic三个公共基准数据集，开发了两种实验流程：基于原始签名图像的方法和采用壳预处理的方法。

Result: 原始图像模型在跨基准测试中取得了更高的性能，而基于壳的模型显示出未来改进的潜力，但两种方法之间没有明确的优劣之分。

Conclusion: 虽然原始图像模型表现更好，但基于壳预处理的方法为开发稳健的跨域签名验证系统提供了有前景的方向，值得未来进一步研究。

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in
banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable
progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline
signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as
variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade
performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature
forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that
is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using
three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental
pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another
employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several
behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive
superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that
the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the
shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward
robust, cross-domain signature verification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、描述符无关的多参考视觉位置识别方法，通过矩阵分解将多个参考描述符联合建模为基表示，实现基于投影的残差匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多参考视觉位置识别中，虽然增加数据多样性和模型复杂度可以提高鲁棒性，但会带来大量计算成本的问题。现有的描述符级融合方法要么针对多传感器设置，要么依赖启发式方法，在应对外观和视角变化时收益有限。

Method: 采用训练免费的描述符无关方法，通过矩阵分解将多个参考描述符联合建模为基表示，实现基于投影的残差匹配。还引入了SotonMV结构化多视角VPR基准。

Result: 在多外观数据上，该方法比单参考方法Recall@1提高了约18%，在外观和视角变化下优于多参考基线方法，在非结构化数据上获得了约5%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持轻量级的同时表现出强大的泛化能力，能够有效处理多参考视觉位置识别问题。

Abstract: We address multi-reference visual place recognition (VPR), where reference
sets captured under varying conditions are used to improve localisation
performance. While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness,
increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational
cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or
aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on
heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose
a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using
multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis
representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce
SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance
data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and
outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes,
with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation
while remaining lightweight.

Motivation: 皮肤癌早期检测至关重要，但现有深度学习模型存在"黑箱"问题，限制了临床信任。病灶的高类内变异性和细微类间差异也增加了自动诊断的难度。

Method: 使用带有双注意力门和空洞空间金字塔池化的Deep-UNet进行病灶分割，分类阶段采用两个DenseNet201编码器处理原始图像和分割病灶，通过多头交叉注意力融合特征，并加入基于transformer的模块整合患者元数据。

Result: 在HAM10000数据集和ISIC 2018、2019挑战中实现了最先进的分割性能，显著提高了分类准确率和平均AUC。Grad-CAM热图验证了模型基于病灶区域进行预测。

Conclusion: 整合精确的病灶分割、临床数据和基于注意力的融合能够构建更准确和可解释的皮肤癌分类模型。

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly
improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is
challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class
differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting
clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based
framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to
enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and
interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates
(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment
lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the
original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via
multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on
salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module
incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We
evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019
challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation
performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC
compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps.
These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the
lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These
results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical
data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable
skin cancer classification model.

TL;DR: SparseVILA是一种高效的视觉语言模型推理范式，通过在预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉token，在解码阶段仅检索查询相关token，实现4.0倍预填充加速、2.5倍解码加速和2.6倍端到端加速，同时提升文档理解和推理任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的可扩展性受到视觉token数量增长的限制，这些token主导了推理延迟。需要一种方法在保持模型能力的同时显著提升推理效率。

Method: 提出解耦视觉稀疏性的新范式：预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉token，解码阶段仅检索查询相关token。基于AWQ优化的推理管道，保留大部分视觉缓存以保持多轮对话保真度。

Result: 在长上下文视频任务中实现4.0倍预填充加速、2.5倍解码加速和2.6倍端到端加速，同时在文档理解和推理任务上提高准确性。

Conclusion: 通过解耦查询无关剪枝和查询感知检索，SparseVILA为高效多模态推理开辟了新方向，提供了无需训练、架构无关的框架来加速大型视觉语言模型而不牺牲能力。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and
textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image
understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their
scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that
dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient
VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding
stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant
visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during
decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while
preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that
query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an
AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster
prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end
speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on
document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic
pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for
efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic
framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

TL;DR: UltraCUA是一个基础模型，通过混合动作将GUI基本操作与高级程序化工具调用无缝集成，解决了计算机使用代理的视觉定位和执行链问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算机使用代理仅依赖基本操作（点击、输入、滚动），需要精确的视觉定位和冗长的执行链，导致级联故障和性能瓶颈。这些代理与丰富的程序化接口（API、MCP服务器、工具）隔离。

Method: 方法包括四个关键组件：(1)从软件文档、开源仓库和代码生成中扩展程序化工具的自动化流水线；(2)生成超过17,000个可验证任务的合成数据引擎；(3)大规模高质量的混合动作轨迹收集；(4)结合监督微调和在线强化学习的两阶段训练管道。

Result: 实验显示7B和32B模型相比最先进代理有显著改进。在OSWorld上，UltraCUA模型相比基础模型平均相对改进22%，步骤速度提升11%。在WindowsAgentArena上的跨域评估达到21.7%成功率，优于在Windows数据上训练的基线。

Conclusion: 混合动作机制至关重要，减少了错误传播同时保持了执行效率，成功将GUI基本操作与高级程序化工具调用集成。

Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions
(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy
execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.
While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,
tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We
present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid
action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic
tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an
automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,
open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine
producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use
scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection
with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online
reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and
high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA
models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while
being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on
WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming
baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,
reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

TL;DR: Glyph框架通过将长文本渲染为图像，利用视觉语言模型处理百万级token的长文本任务，实现3-4倍压缩同时保持准确率，显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs在处理长上下文时面临计算和内存成本过高的问题，限制了百万级token级别长上下文模型的实用性。

Method: 提出Glyph框架：将长文本渲染为图像，使用视觉语言模型处理；设计LLM驱动的遗传搜索来优化视觉渲染配置，平衡准确性和压缩率。

Result: 在多个长上下文基准测试中，实现3-4倍token压缩，准确率与Qwen3-8B相当；预填充和解码速度提升约4倍，SFT训练速度提升约2倍；128K上下文VLM可处理1M token级别任务。

Conclusion: 视觉上下文缩放是解决长上下文LLM挑战的有效方法，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率，并为文档理解等多模态任务带来额外优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for
tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.
However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive
computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.
In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle
this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a
framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with
vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual
input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an
LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations
for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining
accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context
benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and
decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme
compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text
tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal
tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at
https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有免训练注意力控制方法在编辑强度和源一致性之间存在权衡，特别是在多轮和视频编辑中视觉错误会累积。MM-DiT架构的模态集成机制为解决这些挑战提供了新机会。

Method: 基于MM-DiT注意力机制分析，提出三种关键技术：视觉注意力控制、掩码引导预注意力融合、差异化操作query/key/value token。在所有推理步骤和注意力层执行编辑。

Result: 在广泛图像和视频编辑任务中达到最先进性能，支持结构一致和不一致场景，实现鲁棒的多轮和多区域编辑，支持渐进结构调整。

Conclusion: ConsistEdit是首个无需手工设计即可在所有推理步骤和注意力层执行编辑的方法，显著提升了可靠性和一致性，支持更精细的控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled
flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation
models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong
editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation
becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual
errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global
consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as
texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.
Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant
improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for
integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for
overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an
in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention
mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention
control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates
vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and
differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce
consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image
and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and
structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first
approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers
without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which
enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports
progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.
