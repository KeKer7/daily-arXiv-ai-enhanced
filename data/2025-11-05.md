### [1] [iFlyBot-VLA Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01914)
*Yuan Zhang,Chenyu Xue,Wenjie Xu,Chao Ji,Jiajia wu,Jia Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFlyBot-VLA是一个大规模视觉-语言-动作模型，采用新颖的双层动作表示框架和混合训练策略，在机器人操作任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决视觉-语言模型在机器人操作任务中的动作生成问题，需要将语言、视觉和动作表示空间对齐，使VLM能够直接参与动作生成。

Method: 使用潜在动作模型和结构化离散动作令牌的双层监督框架，结合机器人轨迹数据与通用QA和空间QA数据集的混合训练策略。

Result: 在LIBERO Franka基准测试中表现优越，在真实世界评估中在各种挑战性操作任务上达到有竞争力的成功率。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功对齐了语言、视觉和动作表示空间，使VLM能够直接贡献于动作生成，计划开源部分自建数据集支持社区研究。

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

### [2] [Challenging DINOv3 Foundation Model under Low Inter-Class Variability: A Case Study on Fetal Brain Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01915)
*Edoardo Conti,Riccardo Rosati,Lorenzo Federici,Adriano Mancini,Maria Chiara Fiorentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估了基础模型在低类间变异性条件下的胎儿超声成像中的表现，发现领域自适应预训练对区分解剖结构相似的胎儿脑部标准切面至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然DINOv3等视觉基础模型在医学领域表现出良好的可迁移性，但其区分解剖结构相似结构的能力尚未得到系统研究。本研究针对胎儿脑部标准切面（TT、TV、TC）这一具有高度重叠解剖特征的关键挑战展开。

Method: 构建了包含18.8万张标注图像的FetalUS-188K多中心基准数据集，采用自监督方式预训练DINOv3学习超声感知表示，通过线性探测和全微调两种标准化适应协议进行评估，比较了在胎儿超声数据预训练和自然图像DINOv3权重初始化两种方案。

Result: 在胎儿超声数据上预训练的模型始终优于自然图像初始化的模型，加权F1分数提升高达20%。领域自适应预训练使网络能够保留区分中间切面（如TV）所需的细微回声和结构线索。

Conclusion: 通用基础模型在低类间变异性条件下无法良好泛化，而领域特定的预训练对于在胎儿脑部超声成像中获得稳健且临床可靠的表示至关重要。

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

### [3] [Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990)
*Saurabh Kaushik,Lalit Maurya,Elizabeth Tellman,ZhiJie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了地理基础模型(GFMs)与传统U-Net在洪水淹没制图中的表现，发现Clay模型在多数传感器上表现最佳，且计算效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GFMs在从卫星图像中提取时空信息方面具有潜力，但尚不清楚它们是否优于传统模型如U-Net，缺乏跨传感器和数据可用性场景的系统比较。

Method: 评估了三种GFMs(Prithvi 2.0、Clay V1.5、DOFA)和UViT，与TransNorm、U-Net和Attention U-Net进行比较，使用PlanetScope、Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2数据，采用留一区域交叉验证和少样本实验。

Result: Clay在PlanetScope(0.79 mIoU)和Sentinel-2(0.70)上表现最佳，Prithvi在Sentinel-1(0.57)上领先。Clay在少样本实验中仅用5张训练图像就达到0.64 mIoU，且计算速度比其他GFMs快2-3倍。

Conclusion: GFMs在洪水制图精度上提供小幅到中度的改进，同时计算成本和标注工作量更低，Clay是综合性能最佳的选择。

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

### [4] [Locally-Supervised Global Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01998)
*Benjamin Walder,Daniel Toader,Robert Nuster,Günther Paltauf,Peter Burgholzer,Gregor Langer,Lukas Krainer,Markus Haltmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于学习框架的图像重建方法，适用于上采样和修复任务，能够在固定确定性采样模式下实现与全监督方法相当的重建性能，且需要更少的真实数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督方法需要完整采样数据，而自监督方法通常依赖随机采样模式。本文针对固定确定性采样模式（即使在期望意义上也无法完全覆盖图像）的挑战，旨在克服这一限制。

Method: 利用底层图像分布的多个不变性特性，理论上可以实现与全监督方法相同的重建性能。在光分辨率图像上采样任务中验证方法，特别是在光声显微镜（PAM）应用中。

Result: 在光声显微镜图像上采样任务中展示了竞争性或更优的重建结果，同时显著减少了所需的真实数据量。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不完整测量条件下实现高质量图像重建，为固定采样模式下的图像重建问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

### [5] [Towards Selection of Large Multimodal Models as Engines for Burned-in Protected Health Information Detection in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02014)
*Tuan Truong,Guillermo Jimenez Perez,Pedro Osorio,Matthias Lenga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了三种大型多模态模型在医疗影像中受保护健康信息检测的性能，发现LMM在OCR准确性上优于传统方法，但OCR性能提升并不总是转化为更好的整体PHI检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PHI检测方法主要依赖OCR和命名实体识别，而新兴的大型多模态模型为改进文本提取和语义分析提供了新机会，需要系统评估其实际效果。

Method: 使用GPT-4o、Gemini 2.5 Flash和Qwen 2.5 7B三种LMM，比较两种管道配置：纯文本分析以及OCR与语义分析结合的方法。

Result: LMM在OCR效果上显著优于传统模型（WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03），但在复杂印记模式测试案例中表现最佳改进。当文本区域可读性良好且使用强LMM进行文本分析时，不同管道配置结果相似。

Conclusion: 提出了基于实证的LMM选择建议和可扩展模块化基础设施部署策略，强调需要根据具体操作约束选择合适的模型和配置。

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

### [6] [StrengthSense: A Dataset of IMU Signals Capturing Everyday Strength-Demanding Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02027)
*Zeyu Yang,Clayton Souza Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StrengthSense是一个包含11种力量需求活动和2种非力量需求活动的IMU传感器数据集，使用29名健康受试者和10个IMU传感器收集，通过视频标注验证数据准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏全面捕捉力量需求活动的可穿戴传感器数据集，需要填补这一空白以支持肌肉力量、耐力和功率的监测研究。

Method: 使用29名健康受试者，在肢体和躯干上放置10个IMU传感器，收集11种力量需求活动和2种非力量需求活动的数据，并通过视频录制进行标注验证。

Result: 创建了StrengthSense开放数据集，包含全面的IMU信号数据，并通过比较IMU估计的关节角度与视频直接提取的角度来验证数据准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: StrengthSense数据集可用于推进人类活动识别算法开发、创建健身和健康监测应用等，为研究人员和开发者提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

### [7] [Text-VQA Aug: Pipelined Harnessing of Large Multimodal Models for Automated Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02046)
*Soham Joshi,Shwet Kamal Mishra,Viswanath Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个自动化合成文本VQA数据集的端到端流水线，利用OCR、目标区域检测、图像描述生成和问题生成等技术，生成了基于44K图像的72K QA对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建大规模文本VQA数据集需要大量人工标注，既繁琐又具有挑战性。随着处理视觉和语言模态的基础模型以及OCR系统的成熟，急需建立能够基于场景文本自动合成QA对的端到端流水线。

Method: 利用多个模型和算法的能力，包括OCR检测与识别（文本定位）、感兴趣区域检测、图像描述生成和问题生成，将这些组件整合为统一的流水线来自动化合成和验证QA对。

Result: 建立了首个自动合成和验证大规模文本VQA数据集的流水线，基于约44K图像生成了约72K个QA对。

Conclusion: 该流水线能够生成忠实的QA对，并且随着场景文本数据的可用性而扩展，为文本VQA任务提供了高效的数据集构建解决方案。

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

### [8] [Markerless Augmented Reality Registration for Surgical Guidance: A Multi-Anatomy Clinical Accuracy Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02086)
*Yue Yang,Fabian Necker,Christoph Leuze,Michelle Chen,Andrey Finegersh,Jake Lee,Vasu Divi,Bruce Daniel,Brian Hargreaves,Jie Ying Wu,Fred M Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发并临床评估了一种基于头戴式显示器的深度感知、无标记点增强现实配准系统，在真实手术环境中评估了在小或低曲率解剖结构上的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发无需标记点的增强现实配准系统，提高在小型或低曲率解剖结构上的配准精度，推动无标记AR导航的临床应用。

Method: 在HoloLens 2上，通过深度偏差校正、人工引导初始化和全局-局部配准，将手部追踪深度数据与CT皮肤网格对齐。在腿部和足部模型上验证表面追踪误差，并在7例手术中进行临床评估。

Result: 临床前验证显示AR追踪与CT距离高度一致（腿部：中位误差0.78mm，RMSE 0.97mm）。临床应用中，每点误差中位数为3.9mm，不同解剖部位的中位误差分别为：足部3.2mm、耳部4.3mm、小腿5.3mm。

Conclusion: 基于头戴式显示器的深度感知无标记AR配准系统在活体手术环境中实现了3-4mm的中位误差，接近中等风险任务的临床误差阈值，提高了无标记AR导航的临床准备度。

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

### [9] [From Instance Segmentation to 3D Growth Trajectory Reconstruction in Planktonic Foraminifera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02142)
*Huahua Lin,Xiaohao Cai,Mark Nixon,James M. Mulqueeney,Thomas H. G. Ezard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端管道，结合实例分割和专用腔室排序算法，自动从高分辨率CT扫描重建浮游有孔虫的三维生长轨迹，显著减少了手动工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 浮游有孔虫是重要的环境指示生物，但现有的腔室生长轨迹追踪方法主要依赖手动分割，耗时且主观，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 集成实例分割（计算机视觉技术）与专用腔室排序算法，定量评估多种针对不同腔室空间特征优化的分割方法，并分析它们对生长顺序重建精度的影响。

Result: 在专家标注数据集上的实验表明，该管道在保持生物学意义精度的同时显著减少手动工作。腔室排序算法在部分分割情况下仍保持鲁棒性，能一致重建发育轨迹。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了首个完全自动化和可重现的数字有孔虫生长分析管道，为大规模数据驱动的生态研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

### [10] [Fast Measuring Pavement Crack Width by Cascading Principal Component Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02144)
*Zhicheng Wang,Junbiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合PCA和RPCA的级联框架，用于从数字图像中高效提取路面裂缝宽度，解决了裂缝边界复杂性和快速测量的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确量化路面裂缝宽度对评估结构完整性和指导维护至关重要，但传统方法受限于裂缝边界的复杂形态和快速测量需求。

Method: 三阶段级联框架：1) 使用现有检测算法进行初始裂缝分割；2) 通过PCA确定准平行裂缝的主方向轴；3) 使用RPCA提取不规则裂缝几何的主传播轴。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在计算效率和测量精度方面均优于现有最先进技术。

Conclusion: 该级联PCA-RPCA框架为路面裂缝宽度提取提供了一种高效准确的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

### [11] [Autobiasing Event Cameras for Flickering Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02180)
*Mehdi Sefidgar Dilmaghani,Waseem Shariff,Cian Ryan,Joe Lemley,Peter Corcoran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CNN的自适应偏置调节机制，通过动态调整事件相机的偏置设置来抑制25-500Hz范围内的闪烁效应，无需额外硬件或软件滤波。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件相机在不同环境中因光强快速变化产生的闪烁效应问题，提升事件相机在复杂光照条件下的性能表现。

Method: 利用卷积神经网络在空间域识别闪烁实例，并动态调整特定偏置参数来最小化闪烁影响，采用人脸检测框架进行系统验证。

Result: 在明暗条件下均显著改善：YOLO人脸检测置信度提升，检测到人脸的帧数比例增加，平均梯度（闪烁指示器）在明亮条件下降低38.2%，暗光条件下降低53.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升事件相机在不利光照场景下的功能性，为事件相机在各种环境中的稳定运行提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of
adverse lighting scenarios.

*Jinhwan Seo,Yoonki Cho,Junhyug Noh,Sung-eui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个解决GVQA任务的三阶段框架，通过引入触发时刻概念显著提升了HOTA得分


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GVQA任务需要多模态模型具备视频内容复杂推理、视觉定位和时间追踪能力，现有方法在这些方面存在不足

Method: 将GVQA任务分解为三阶段流程：视频推理与问答、时空定位、追踪，并引入基于CORTEX提示的触发时刻概念来定位目标对象最清晰帧

Result: HOTA得分达到0.4968，相比去年获胜分数0.2704有显著提升

Conclusion: 提出的触发时刻概念为定位和追踪提供了鲁棒的锚点，三阶段框架有效解决了GVQA任务的挑战

Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video
Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The
GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over
video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the
referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed
approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video
Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key
contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed
CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object
to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve
the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the
previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

### [13] [MM-UNet: Morph Mamba U-shaped Convolutional Networks for Retinal Vessel Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02193)
*Jiawen Liu,Yuanbo Zeng,Jiaming Liang,Yizhen Yang,Yiheng Zhang,Enhui Cai,Xiaoqi Sheng,Hongmin Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MM-UNet架构，通过引入形态Mamba卷积层和反向选择性状态引导模块，显著提升了视网膜血管分割的精度，在DRIVE和STARE数据集上分别获得1.64%和1.25%的F1分数提升。


<details>

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于大语言模型的多模态融合生成模型，能够从血液生物标志物和MRI扫描合成淀粉样蛋白PET图像，用于阿尔茨海默病诊断。


<details>

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
disease.

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

Motivation: 当前左心室节段纵向应变的估计技术需要大量人工干预和专业知识，限制了效率，难以用于监测目的。

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了将基础模型集成到移动稀疏感知系统中的前景和开放挑战。

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

Conclusion: 所提出的协作注意力和一致性引导融合框架能够有效整合MRI和PET的多模态信息，在阿尔茨海默病诊断中表现出色。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway
phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to
state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on
both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results
across various backbones and pretrained weights. Our code is available at

Conclusion: HTSC-CIF框架通过分层任务分解成功解决了医学报告生成中的三个关键挑战，为可靠的病灶描述提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

Conclusion: SAIL-RL是构建更可靠和自适应多模态大语言模型的原则性框架。

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

Motivation: 现有相机位姿估计方法通常依赖相机间距离信息，且缺乏鲁棒性保证。本文旨在开发一个仅基于循环一致性就能实现精确恢复的全局框架，避免对距离信息的依赖并提高鲁棒性。

Method: 改进消息传递最小二乘法(MPLS)，强调循环一致性信息，使用估计距离重新定义循环一致性，引入Welsch型鲁棒损失，并集成基于鲁棒子空间恢复的离群值拒绝模块。

Result: 建立了相机位置估计的最强确定性精确恢复保证，仅凭循环一致性即可达到目前已知的最低样本复杂度。在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，Cycle-Sync持续优于领先的位姿估计方法。

Conclusion: Cycle-Sync提供了一个无需束调整的全局相机位姿估计框架，仅依赖循环一致性就能实现鲁棒且准确的位姿估计，在理论和实验上都优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion
pipelines with bundle adjustment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后处理OOD检测方法往往忽略特征与logits之间的内在相关性，这限制了OOD检测的有效性。

Method: GAFD-CC首先进行全局感知特征解耦，提取正相关和负相关特征；然后自适应融合解耦特征与多尺度logit置信度。

Result: 在大规模基准测试中，GAFD-CC展现出竞争性性能和强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GAFD-CC通过有效利用特征与logits的关联性，显著提升了OOD检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Portable physiological monitoring is essential for early detection and
management of cardiovascular disease, but current methods often require
specialized equipment that limits accessibility or impose impractical postures
that patients cannot maintain. Video-based photoplethysmography on smartphones
offers a convenient noninvasive alternative, yet it still faces reliability
challenges caused by motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view
constraints. Few studies have demonstrated reliable application to
cardiovascular patients, and no widely used open datasets exist for
cross-device accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce the M3PD
dataset, the first publicly available dual-view mobile photoplethysmography
dataset, comprising synchronized facial and fingertip videos captured
simultaneously via front and rear smartphone cameras from 60 participants

further propose F3Mamba, which fuses the facial and fingertip views through
Mamba-based temporal modeling. The model reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to
30.2 percent over existing single-view baselines while improving robustness in
challenging real-world scenarios. Data and code:

*Jizheng Ma,Xiaofei Zhou,Yanlong Song,Han Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoVa是一个新颖的视觉语言模型框架，通过连续跨模态推理来解决传统VLMs在离散语言空间推理的局限性，使用潜在思维向量链进行迭代推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类认知中存在许多难以用语言表达的思维过程，而当前视觉语言模型受限于离散语言标记空间，限制了视觉感知的丰富性。

Method: 采用迭代推理循环，使用新颖的Latent Q-Former作为动态推理引擎，通过跨模态融合迭代优化潜在思维向量链，结合对比学习和扩散重建的多任务目标训练。

Result: CoCoVa在准确性和标记效率上优于强基线模型，1.5B骨干模型在几乎所有基准测试中可与或超越7B-9B模型，7B骨干模型仍具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 学习的潜在空间捕获了可解释的结构化推理模式，展示了CoCoVa在弥合离散语言处理与连续视觉理解之间表征差距的潜力。

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

TL;DR: 提出RxnCaption框架，将化学反应图解析重新定义为图像描述问题，使用BIVP策略和MolYOLO分子检测器，构建了RxnCaption-11k数据集，在多个指标上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化学反应数据多为论文中的图像，无法被机器读取和用于机器学习模型训练，需要解决化学反应图的解析问题。

Method: 采用图像描述方法，引入BIVP策略，使用MolYOLO分子检测器预先绘制分子边界框和索引，将解析转化为自然语言描述问题。

Result: BIVP策略显著提高结构提取质量并简化模型设计，RxnCaption-VL在多个指标上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法、数据集和模型将推动化学文献中结构化信息提取的发展，促进化学领域更广泛的AI应用。

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达传感器可直接测量点云的多普勒速度，但雷达点云稀疏且噪声大，数据标注成本高昂，需要自监督方法减少标注依赖。

Method: 采用两步法：对比自监督表示学习+有限标注数据的监督微调，提出基于聚类的对比损失函数和动态点去除的聚类优化。

Result: 通过自监督预训练提高了标签效率，在微调后有效提升了最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了对稀疏噪声雷达点云的自监督运动物体分割，显著减少了标注需求并提升了性能。

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our
method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting
state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分组的混合颜色校正算法，用于彩色点云的颜色一致性校正。根据重叠率将目标点云分成不同组别，分别采用K近邻双边插值、联合KBI和直方图均衡化等方法进行颜色校正。

Conclusion: 该算法通过分组策略和混合校正方法，有效解决了彩色点云的颜色一致性问题，提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed
from the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过冻结编码器基准测试，发现自监督ViT模型在猫类和人类视觉系统表征对齐方面表现最佳，表明自监督学习和ViT架构偏置能产生更接近跨物种视觉系统的表征几何。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解猫类垂直瞳孔等特殊视觉解剖结构如何影响下游视觉表征，以及不同视觉模型在跨物种表征对齐方面的表现差异。

Method: 使用统一的冻结编码器基准测试，比较卷积网络、监督ViT、窗口Transformer和自监督ViT，采用层间中心核对齐和表征相似性分析等方法。

Result: DINO ViT-B/16模型获得最高的跨物种表征对齐（平均CKA-RBF≈0.814，平均CKA-linear≈0.745，平均RSA≈0.698），在早期块达到峰值。监督ViT在CKA上具有竞争力但在几何对应上较弱。

Conclusion: 自监督学习与ViT架构偏置相结合，能产生比CNN和窗口Transformer更接近猫类和人类视觉系统对齐的表征几何，为跨物种视觉计算收敛提供了可测试的神经科学假设。

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

TL;DR: IllumFlow是一个结合条件整流流和Retinex理论的低光照图像增强框架，通过分别优化光照和反射分量来处理光照变化和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光照图像增强中光照变化范围大和噪声复杂的问题，提供精确的光照适应和可定制的亮度增强。

Method: 首先基于Retinex理论将图像分解为反射和光照分量；使用条件整流流框架建模光照变化的连续流场；通过流增强的数据增强去噪网络去除反射噪声和色差。

Result: 在低光照增强和曝光校正任务上，相比现有方法表现出更优的定量和定性性能。

Conclusion: IllumFlow能够精确适应不同光照条件，同时自然支持可定制的亮度增强，在低光照图像增强方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified
Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our
model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of
illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting
variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these
limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)
strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
chart comprehension.

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for
agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires
large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic
data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images
remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural
generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated
datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
training.

Abstract: Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are
highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information,
allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its
environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs)
have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling
domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks,
combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity
poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of
Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and
inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of
state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action
Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to
edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is
evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape,

Abstract: Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where
accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image
analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes
Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image
inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by
very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the
Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on
preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models
with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space
Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient
and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into
the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the
stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that
KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a
scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of
preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.

Motivation: 解决现有多视角动作识别方法无法适用于时空动作识别(STAR)设置的问题，因为传统方法只关注整个视频的单一动作识别，而STAR需要按时间顺序识别每个人的动作。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的多视角协作模块，使用保留空间信息的特征图而非丢失空间信息的嵌入向量，并将自注意力分为相同视图和不同视图两部分来有效建模多视图关系。

Conclusion: MVAFormer成功解决了多视角动作识别在STAR设置下的应用问题，通过保留空间信息和分视图注意力机制实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.
The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly
released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in
tasks such as image generation and reasoning. However, applying these models to
the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available
datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we
introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k
high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos
covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data
are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding
boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications
such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers
clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data
quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world
scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks,
including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and
vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset
to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent
safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire
understanding in the AI community. The dataset is available at

*Robinson Umeike,Neil Getty,Yin Xiangyu,Yi Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PtychoBench多模态基准，系统比较了SFT和ICL两种专业化策略在ptychography分析中的表现，发现最优策略取决于任务模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将通用基础模型适应于专业科学任务时，最优领域适应策略尚不明确，需要系统评估不同策略在科学工作流自动化中的效果。

Method: 使用PtychoBench基准，在数据稀缺情况下比较监督微调(SFT)和上下文学习(ICL)策略，分别评估视觉伪影检测和文本参数推荐任务。

Result: 视觉任务中SFT和ICL互补性最强，微调模型结合上下文示例达到最高性能；文本任务中ICL在大型基础模型上表现最优，超越强大的SFT模型。

Conclusion: 科学AI中专业化路径的选择取决于任务模态，为开发更有效的科学代理系统提供了明确框架。

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

TL;DR: 提出基于能量优化的视频镜头组装方法，通过视觉语义匹配和能量模型学习参考视频的组装风格，实现自动化视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频编辑依赖人工经验，现有智能编辑技术难以捕捉创作者的独特艺术表达，需要自动化但能保持艺术风格的镜头组装方法。

Method: 1. 使用大语言模型生成脚本并与视频库进行视觉语义匹配；2. 分割标注参考视频镜头，提取镜头大小、相机运动等属性；3. 基于能量模型学习参考风格并评分候选镜头序列；4. 结合语法规则优化镜头组装。

Result: 开发了能够学习参考视频组装风格的系统，即使没有编辑经验的用户也能创建视觉吸引力强的视频。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了自动化镜头组装，同时保持了参考视频的艺术风格，为视频编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing,
involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative,
convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been
manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video
editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often
fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To
address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for
video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching
between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to
obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we
segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such
as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models
to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their
alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization
by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the
assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the
arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,
narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style
of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual
expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience
can create visually compelling videos. Project page:

Motivation: 深度学习使机器人系统能在动态非结构化环境中交互，但关键任务应用需要评估大量异构数据，自动报告生成对促进系统评估和接受至关重要。

Method: 开发了基于多模态传感器的自然语言自动报告生成管道，完全依赖可在边缘设备上部署的本地模型。

Result: 在包含室内、室外和城市环境的多样化数据集上评估实现，提供了定量和定性评估结果。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成自动化报告，同时保护所有参与者的隐私，无需依赖外部服务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated
example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public

### [44] [LiteVoxel: Low-memory Intelligent Thresholding for Efficient Voxel Rasterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02510)
*Jee Won Lee,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteVoxel是一种自调优的稀疏体素光栅化训练管道，通过逆Sobel重加权和深度分位数剪枝等技术，解决了传统方法在低频内容拟合不足、边界不稳定和VRAM过度增长的问题，同时显著降低内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏体素光栅化在基于优化的场景重建中虽然快速且可微分，但存在对低频内容拟合不足、依赖脆弱的剪枝启发式方法以及VRAM过度增长的问题，需要更稳定和轻量化的解决方案。

Method: 采用逆Sobel重加权和训练中期的gamma斜坡使损失函数对低频内容敏感；使用基于深度分位数的剪枝逻辑替代固定阈值，通过EMA滞后保护和基于射线足迹的优先级驱动细分来稳定和优化结构，并在显式增长预算下进行。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks & Temples数据集上的实验表明，LiteVoxel减少了低频区域和边界不稳定的错误，同时保持PSNR/SSIM、训练时间和FPS与强基线相当，关键是将峰值VRAM降低了40%-60%，并保留了先前设置遗漏的低频细节。

Conclusion: LiteVoxel实现了更可预测、内存效率更高的训练，而不会牺牲感知质量，为稀疏体素光栅化提供了稳定且轻量化的解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

Conclusion: 本研究强调了无监督深度学习在工业环境中实现可扩展、标签高效的剪切散斑检测的潜力，师生方法在自动异常检测方面表现突出。

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

Motivation: 预测未来的脑部状态对神经退行性疾病研究至关重要，现有方法主要预测认知评分或临床结果，而本研究直接预测整个脑部MRI图像。

Method: 实现并评估了五种深度学习架构（UNet、U2-Net、UNETR、Time-Embedding UNet、ODE-UNet），在两个纵向队列上进行训练和测试。

Result: 最佳模型实现了高保真度的预测，所有模型在独立外部数据集上泛化良好，表现出稳健的跨队列性能。

Conclusion: 深度学习可以在体素级别可靠地预测个体化的脑部MRI，为个体化预后提供了新机会。

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨视角（如空中-地面监控）视频行人重识别中的极端视角变化、尺度差异和时间不一致性问题。

Method: 在ViT-B/16骨干网络上添加7个模块：跨流特征归一化、多分辨率特征协调、身份感知记忆模块、时序动态建模、跨视角特征对齐、分层时序模式学习和多视角身份一致性学习。

Result: 仅增加约200万参数和0.7 GFLOPs，保持实时效率（189 FPS），在AG-VPReID基准测试中实现最先进性能，并在G2A-VReID和MARS数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 精心设计的适配器模块可以在不牺牲计算效率的情况下显著增强跨视角鲁棒性和时间一致性。

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without
compromising computational efficiency. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨受试者泛化挑战，开发无需特定训练就能从fMRI重建连续视觉体验的方法，具有临床应用的巨大潜力。

Method: 提出VCFlow层次化解码框架，显式建模人类视觉系统的腹侧-背侧结构，分离并利用早期视觉皮层、腹侧流和背侧流的特征，并引入特征级对比学习策略增强主体不变语义表征提取。

Result: 与传统方法需要超过12小时每受试者数据和大量计算相比，VCFlow仅牺牲7%准确率，但能在10秒内生成每个重建视频且无需重新训练。

Conclusion: VCFlow提供了一种快速且临床可扩展的解决方案，为无需特定训练的大脑解码开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: TAUE是一个无需训练、零样本的层次化图像生成框架，通过噪声移植和培育技术实现前景、背景和合成层的语义结构一致性，解决了传统文本到图像扩散模型在专业应用中缺乏层次控制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型只能输出扁平图像，缺乏专业应用所需的层次控制能力。现有解决方案要么需要大量数据集进行微调，要么只能生成孤立的前景元素，无法产生完整连贯的场景。

Method: 提出噪声移植和培育(NTC)技术，从前景和合成生成过程中提取中间潜在表示，将其移植到后续层的初始噪声中，确保各层之间的语义和结构一致性。

Result: 实验表明，这种无需训练的方法性能可与微调方法相媲美，在保持高图像质量和保真度的同时增强了层次一致性。

Conclusion: TAUE不仅消除了昂贵的训练和数据集需求，还解锁了复杂组合编辑等新型下游应用，为更易访问和可控的生成工作流程铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

Abstract: Multi-animal tracking is crucial for understanding animal ecology and
behavior. However, it remains a challenging task due to variations in habitat,
motion patterns, and species appearance. Traditional approaches typically
require extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each application
scenario. In this work, we explore the potential of recent vision foundation
models for zero-shot multi-animal tracking. By combining a Grounding Dino
object detector with the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and carefully
designed heuristics, we develop a tracking framework that can be applied to new
datasets without any retraining or hyperparameter adaptation. Evaluations on
ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and a subset of GMOT-40 demonstrate
strong and consistent performance across diverse species and environments. The

Motivation: 当前变化检测模型通常只能从单一类型标注数据中获取有限知识，无法同时利用多样的BCD和SCD数据集，导致泛化能力差和功能有限。MLLM的发展为统一变化检测框架提供了新可能。

Method: 利用MLLM的语言先验和统一能力，开发UniChange模型。通过三个特殊令牌统一BCD和SCD任务，使用文本提示指导变化类别识别，无需依赖预定义分类头，能够有效从多源数据集中获取知识。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试(WHU-CD、S2Looking、LEVIR-CD+和SECOND)上达到最先进性能，IoU分数分别为90.41、53.04、78.87和57.62，超越了所有先前方法。

Conclusion: UniChange成功展示了MLLM在统一变化检测任务中的潜力，通过语言驱动的统一框架有效解决了传统模型在多源数据融合和任务统一方面的限制。

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,
surpassing all previous methods. The code is available at

### [53] [Robust Face Liveness Detection for Biometric Authentication using Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02645)
*Poulami Raha,Yeongnam Chae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级CNN框架来检测面部识别系统中的呈现攻击（打印/显示、视频和包裹攻击），确保快速生物认证（CPU上1-2秒），并创建了包含500多个视频的新数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部识别系统容易受到呈现攻击，恶意行为者可以通过欺骗手段非法访问安全系统，需要有效的活体检测方法。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN框架来识别不同类型的呈现攻击，包括打印/显示、视频和包裹攻击。

Result: 提出的架构能够提供无缝的活体检测，在CPU上实现1-2秒的快速生物认证，并创建了包含60个受试者的500多个视频的新数据集。

Conclusion: 该轻量级CNN框架能有效检测多种呈现攻击，确保面部识别系统的安全性，并通过演示视频验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial
systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial
features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the
vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.
Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get
illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight
CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed
robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster
biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a
newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos
collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,
we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack
detection approaches. The demo can be viewed in the following link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPruneBench是一个统一的可扩展基准，用于评估多模态大模型中视觉令牌剪枝方法，涵盖6个能力维度和10个数据集，评估10种压缩算法和3类LMM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大模型因图像编码器引入大量视觉令牌而存在严重的推理效率问题，现有的令牌压缩方法评估零散且不一致。

Method: 建立统一基准，包含标准化协议、系统级指标（运行时间和预填充延迟），评估代表性压缩算法在多模态模型上的表现。

Result: 发现随机剪枝是强基线，没有单一方法在所有场景中表现最佳，剪枝敏感性因任务而异（OCR最敏感），剪枝比例是性能下降的主导因素。

Conclusion: UniPruneBench将为高效多模态建模的未来研究提供可靠基础。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference
inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image
encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,
have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端可微分的自适应tokenizer，能够根据图像内容以像素级粒度调整token，同时保持与现有架构的向后兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Vision Transformers使用固定的patch token，忽略了图像的空间和语义结构，需要更智能的token化方法。

Method: 使用分层模型选择和信息准则，开发端到端可微分tokenizer，支持像素级粒度自适应。

Result: 在图像级分类和密集预测任务中表现优异，还支持开箱即用的栅格到矢量转换。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了内容感知的token化方案，能够有效提升Vision Transformers的性能和功能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on fixed patch tokens that ignore the spatial and
semantic structure of images. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end
differentiable tokenizer that adapts to image content with pixel-level
granularity while remaining backward-compatible with existing architectures for
retrofitting pretrained models. Our method uses hierarchical model selection
with information criteria to provide competitive performance in both
image-level classification and dense-prediction tasks, and even supports
out-of-the-box raster-to-vector conversion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模态转换表示学习(MTRL)的可见光-红外行人重识别框架，通过生成中间图像作为模态转换器，无需额外参数即可有效对齐跨模态特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖中间表示来对齐跨模态特征，但这些方法要么通过生成中间图像(数据增强)，要么融合中间特征(参数多、可解释性差)，且未能充分利用中间特征。可见光和红外模态之间存在显著差异。

Method: 使用生成的中间图像作为可见光到红外模态的转换器，该图像与原始可见光图像完全对齐且与红外模态相似。采用模态转换对比损失和模态查询正则化损失进行训练，有效对齐跨模态特征。

Result: 在三个典型的VI-ReID数据集上，该模型显著且持续地优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MTRL框架无需额外参数，在保持骨干网络推理速度的同时提升了VI-ReID任务的性能，实现了跨模态特征的有效对齐。

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently
outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

Motivation: 情感具有动态性和线索依赖性，现有方法难以理解复杂且不断变化的情感状态并提供合理推理。

Method: 采用分阶段的情感线索引导推理框架，包括基础属性感知、表情分析和高级情感理解；开发视频情感基础模型VidEmo，通过课程情感学习和情感树强化学习进行两阶段调优。

Result: 在15个人脸感知任务上取得了有竞争力的性能，树立了新的里程碑。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和模型有效解决了视频情感分析的挑战，为情感理解任务提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant
attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language
models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion
analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.
Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it
difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable
rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided
reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression
analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the
core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),
specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These
models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning
for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement
learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data
infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)
consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes
explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated
rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive
performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

TL;DR: 提出LLEXICORP方法，将概念相关性传播与多模态大语言模型结合，自动为CNN概念原型命名并生成自然语言解释，降低深度神经网络解释的门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念相关性传播方法需要专家手动检查激活图像来命名概念，并从相关性图中合成冗长解释，限制了可访问性和可扩展性。

Method: 构建模块化流水线，将CRP与多模态大语言模型耦合，通过精心设计的提示教导语言模型CRP语义，分离命名和解释任务。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集VGG16模型上的定性评估表明，该方法能自动生成描述性概念名称和直观的自然语言解释。

Conclusion: 将基于概念的可视化方法与大型语言模型结合，可以显著降低解释深度神经网络的门槛，为更透明的AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision
systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to
explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works
suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be
attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance
propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find
images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are
largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered
concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting
the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept
Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a
multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive
names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that
translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To
ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the
semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and
explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,
offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries
for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a
VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution
methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to
interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI
systems.

TL;DR: 本文首次对视频-文本表示对齐进行了全面研究，揭示了跨模态对齐高度依赖于测试时视觉和文本数据的丰富程度，提出了参数化测试时缩放定律，并探讨了语义对齐与下游任务性能的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然图像与文本的对齐研究已取得显著进展，但视频数据的时序特性在这一背景下仍未被充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究现代视频和语言编码器在视频-文本表示对齐方面的能力。

Method: 通过综合研究视频-文本表示对齐，分析不同编码器的能力，提出参数化测试时缩放定律来捕捉视觉和文本数据丰富度对对齐效果的影响。

Result: 研究发现跨模态对齐高度依赖于测试时视觉（静态图像vs多帧视频）和文本（单字幕vs集合）数据的丰富程度，提出的缩放定律与经验观察具有显著预测能力。语义对齐与下游任务性能存在相关性，强对齐可能与通用视频表示和理解相关。

Conclusion: 视频-文本对齐为探索时空数据的不同编码器表示能力提供了一种信息丰富的零样本方法，为视觉和语言模型提供了具有挑战性的测试平台。

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been
shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream
capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant
progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of
video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing
the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal
several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly
depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)
and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,
especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric
test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable
predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the
correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and
non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment
against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and
understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal
alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.
Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot
way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal
data. Project page can be found at https://video-prh.github.io/

TL;DR: PercHead是一个用于单图像3D头部重建和语义3D编辑的统一方法，通过双分支编码器和ViT解码器实现3D重建，并使用基于DINOv2和SAM2.1的感知监督策略。该方法在视角合成方面达到最先进水平，并能通过替换编码器实现直观的3D语义编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单图像3D头部重建面临的严重视角遮挡、弱感知监督以及3D空间编辑模糊性等固有挑战。

Method: 使用双分支编码器和基于ViT的解码器，通过迭代交叉注意力将2D特征提升到3D空间，采用高斯泼溅进行渲染，并引入基于DINOv2和SAM2.1的新型感知监督策略。

Result: 在视角合成方面达到最先进性能，对极端视角表现出卓越的鲁棒性，并能通过轻量级交互GUI实现直观的3D编辑。

Conclusion: PercHead提供了一个统一的3D头部重建和编辑框架，通过感知监督和模块化设计实现了高质量的重建结果和直观的编辑能力。

Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

TL;DR: VCode是一个将多模态理解重新定义为代码生成的基准，使用SVG作为紧凑、可解释的可执行视觉表示。VCoder框架通过迭代修订和视觉工具增强VLM，在符号保真度方面显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI进展主要集中在语言中心任务，而视觉中心编码研究不足。受人类草图推理启发，作者倡导SVG代码作为紧凑、可解释、可执行的视觉表示。

Method: 引入VCode基准，将多模态理解重构为代码生成任务；提出CodeVQA评估协议；开发VCoder代理框架，包含"带修订的思考"（迭代分析差异并优化SVG代码）和"带视觉工具的行动"（使用检测器和解析器提供结构化线索）。

Result: 前沿VLM在生成忠实SVG方面表现不佳，显示语言中心与视觉中心编码之间存在差距。VCoder相比表现最佳的Claude-4-Opus实现了12.3分的总体提升。人类研究显示人类和VLM在渲染SVG上表现都更差，但一致性揭示了符号视觉表示的潜力。

Conclusion: SVG代码作为视觉表示具有前景，但当前VLM在视觉中心编码方面仍有局限。VCoder框架通过迭代修订和视觉工具显著提升了符号保真度，为视觉推理开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at
https://github.com/CSU-JPG/VCode.

TL;DR: MIRA是一个新的基准测试，专门评估模型在需要生成中间视觉图像进行推理的场景中的表现。该基准包含546个多模态问题，强调通过生成草图、结构图等中间图像来指导推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链方法仅依赖文本，而许多复杂问题需要视觉化思考。MIRA旨在模拟人类通过"画图思考"解决复杂问题的方式，评估模型在需要视觉中间表示的推理任务中的能力。

Method: 提出统一的评估协议，包含三个输入级别：仅图像和问题的直接输入、带思维提示的文本思维链输入、以及带注释图像线索和文本提示的视觉思维链输入。使用pass@k和多数投票准确率评估模型上限。

Result: 实验显示现有多模态大语言模型在仅依赖文本提示时表现不佳，但当提供中间视觉线索时，模型性能平均相对提升33.7%。扩大搜索空间和设计对齐视觉思维链的文本提示只能带来有限改进。

Conclusion: 结果强调了想象视觉信息在MIRA基准上成功推理的关键作用，表明视觉中间表示对于复杂推理任务的重要性。

Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的媒体（特别是深度伪造）对多媒体取证、错误信息检测和生物识别系统构成严重威胁，导致公众对法律系统的信任度下降、欺诈行为显著增加和社会工程攻击。现有取证方法存在三个关键缺陷：非标准化基准、不一致的训练协议以及有限的评估指标。

Result: 评估显示不同方法在泛化能力上存在显著差异，某些方法在分布内表现良好但在跨模型可迁移性上表现下降。

Conclusion: 该研究旨在指导研究社区更深入理解当前取证方法的优势和局限性，并激发开发更鲁棒、可泛化和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model
optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE
embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch
size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are
pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large
multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across
over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains.
Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates
that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying
spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,
segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides
high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G
establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,
including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse
improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world
applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.

Abstract: We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,
enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D
image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for
each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In
order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,
estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse
in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,
encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ
multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well
as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,
which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The
representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head
tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method
is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.
Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained
representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and
monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model
checkpoint will be made available to the public.
