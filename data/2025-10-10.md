### [1] [Enhancing Maritime Object Detection in Real-Time with RT-DETR and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07346)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于RT-DETR的实时海上目标检测系统，通过合成图像增强和多尺度特征融合，解决了小目标检测和真实数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临小目标尺寸和真实RGB标注数据有限的挑战，需要开发既能实时运行又能在复杂海况下保持鲁棒性的检测系统。

Method: 采用RT-DETR架构，结合多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化查询选择和合成-真实数据权重平衡策略，同时使用数据增强技术平衡数据集类别。

Result: 开发了完整的Python鲁棒海上检测流水线，在保持实时性能的同时验证了各模块的贡献，并测试了系统在极端光照和海况下的表现。

Conclusion: 该系统在保留DETR端到端集合预测优势的同时，允许用户在推理时调整速度与精度平衡，并通过组件分析量化了各架构模块的贡献。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DynamicEval基准，专注于动态相机运动的文本到视频评估，包含45k人工标注，解决了现有基准在相机运动和视频级评估方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V评估基准存在两个局限：忽视动态相机运动的重要性，以及将视频级评分聚合为模型级评分而忽略视频级评估。

Method: 构建包含动态相机运动提示的基准，获得45k人工标注；提出背景场景一致性指标（基于Vbench运动平滑度改进）和前景对象一致性指标（跟踪对象实例内的点）。

Result: 提出的指标在视频级和模型级与人类偏好相关性更强（提升超过2%），建立了更全面的动态相机运动T2V评估基准。

Conclusion: DynamicEval通过关注动态相机运动和视频级评估，为T2V模型提供了更全面的评估框架，提出的新指标显著提升了与人类判断的一致性。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RISP方法，结合重启惯性机制和基于分数的图像先验，在保持高质量重建的同时实现快速收敛


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RED专注于设计复杂图像先验来提高重建质量，但收敛加速依赖启发式方法，需要填补这一空白

Method: 在RED基础上引入重启惯性机制，同时保留基于分数的图像先验，并分析了相关的连续时间动力系统

Result: RISP比RED获得更快的驻点收敛速度，且不要求图像先验的凸性，在多种成像逆问题中实现快速收敛和高质量重建

Conclusion: RISP为成像逆问题提供了一种既保证快速收敛又保持高质量重建的principled方法

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图像纯化策略的超低剂量CT去噪框架，解决了真实临床uLDCT数据中严重的噪声、伪影和空间不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量CT显著减少辐射暴露，但引入了严重噪声、伪影和与正常剂量CT图像的空间不对齐问题，这给现有去噪网络在真实临床数据上的应用带来了挑战。

Method: 首先构建真实临床uLDCT肺部数据集，然后提出图像纯化策略生成结构对齐的uLDCT-NDCT图像对，最后提出频域流匹配模型与IP策略协同工作。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上的实验表明，IP策略显著提升了多个主流去噪模型在uLDCT任务上的性能，FFM模型结合IP策略在解剖结构保持方面达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 本研究为真实世界uLDCT去噪中的数据不匹配问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

### [5] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2RA是一种无需训练的单图像攻击方法，能够有效移除或削弱各种水印方案，揭示了当前水印设计的根本弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的广泛使用增加了对水印方法的需求，但现有的语义水印方案即使在资源受限的对抗环境下仍然脆弱。

Method: 通过将水印图像投影到互补表示的自然先验上，D2RA抑制水印信号同时保持视觉保真度，无需访问底层模型。

Result: 实验表明该方法能持续降低水印可检测性，在多种水印方案中都表现一致。

Conclusion: 当前水印设计存在根本性弱点，需要更鲁棒的水印方案来应对此类攻击。

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [6] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle是一个视频风格转换框架，使用扩散模型和低秩适配器，通过静态图像数据训练实现视频风格转换，保持内容一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频风格转换中缺乏配对视频数据监督的问题，利用现有的配对静态图像数据来训练视频风格转换模型。

Method: 在预训练视频扩散模型中插入低秩适配器，使用共享增强构建合成训练片段，并提出上下文-风格分类器自由引导(CS-CFG)方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了时间一致、风格忠实且内容保持的视频转换，在质量和数量上都优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PickStyle框架通过有效利用静态图像数据和创新的引导方法，成功解决了视频风格转换中的数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的视频风格转换。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [7] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出TRAVL方法，通过平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块来改进视频语言模型的物理合理性判断能力，并创建了ImplausiBench基准来评估模型的物理推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频生成模型经常产生违反物理规律的序列，但目前缺乏定量评估物理真实性的方法。现有视频语言模型在识别物理违规方面存在困难，暴露了其时序和因果推理的局限性。

Method: 引入TRAVL微调方法，结合平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块来改进运动编码和判别能力。同时提出ImplausiBench基准，包含300个视频（150个真实，150个生成），消除语言偏见并隔离视觉-时序理解。

Result: TRAVL和ImplausiBench为多模态模型中的物理合理性提供了一个统一的探测和改进框架，揭示了视觉-时序理解中一个具有挑战性且未被充分探索的方面。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决视频生成模型中的物理违规问题提供了有效的评估和改进方法，推动了多模态模型在物理推理能力方面的发展。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [8] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出S3FN网络，利用LLM生成的文本描述增强高光谱图像分类，通过语义-光谱-空间融合提升分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高光谱图像分类中训练样本有限、数据维度高导致的过拟合问题，以及传统单模态方法仅依赖光谱空间数据的局限性

Method: 使用LLM生成类别文本描述，通过BERT/RoBERTa编码为语义向量，与光谱空间特征融合进行特征-标签对齐

Result: 在三个高光谱基准数据集上取得显著性能提升，验证了文本语义与光谱空间数据的协同作用

Conclusion: 语义增强的高光谱分类模型具有发展潜力，文本语义能有效补充光谱空间信息，提升分类性能

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [9] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CAGUL框架，一种轻量级的视觉语言模型遗忘方法，通过跨模态注意力引导来防止敏感信息泄露，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆并泄露私密敏感信息，而现有的遗忘方法主要针对文本模型，视觉模态增加了复杂性。

Method: 利用跨模态注意力分析视觉令牌的重要性，通过外部模块在低重要性视觉令牌中编码遗忘信息，不改变预训练模型参数。

Result: 实验表明CAGUL方法性能优于或与微调基线相当，能有效防止信息泄露并保持参考模型行为。

Conclusion: CAGUL为视觉语言模型提供了一种实用且有效的遗忘解决方案，无需重新训练成本。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [10] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaSC是一个基于YOLOv9的自动化玉米幼苗计数算法，使用低成本无人机RGB图像，能区分玉米与杂草，提供精确的行级株数统计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动计数玉米株数劳动密集、耗时且易出错，特别是在大面积或变化较大的田地中，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性。

Method: MaSC采用两种模式：基于拼接图像的分块处理和基于原始视频帧的配准处理，使用轻量级YOLOv9模型检测V2-V10生长阶段的玉米幼苗，并进行行和范围分割。

Result: 与2024年夏季苗圃实地手动计数相比，MaSC与真实值高度一致（拼接图像R²=0.616，原始帧R²=0.906），处理83帧全分辨率图像仅需60.63秒。

Conclusion: MaSC被证明是一种可扩展、低成本且准确的自动化玉米株数计数工具，适用于研究和生产环境。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

### [11] [Quick-CapsNet (QCN): A fast alternative to Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07600)
*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Quick-CapsNet（QCN）作为Capsule Network的快速替代方案，通过减少胶囊数量实现5倍推理速度提升，但准确率略有下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet在检测重叠数字和对抗仿射变换方面优于传统CNN，但训练和推理速度慢，限制了其在需要快速网络的实时应用中的使用

Method: 通过产生更少数量的胶囊来构建更快的网络，并采用更强大的解码器来进一步提升性能

Result: 在MNIST、F-MNIST、SVHN和Cifar-10数据集上推理速度提升5倍，但准确率有轻微损失

Conclusion: QCN是CapsNet的快速替代方案，为开发快速实时应用的CapsNet提供了起点

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [12] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Rectified-CFG++方法，解决标准CFG在整流流模型中的离流形漂移问题，通过自适应预测-校正机制确保轨迹稳定性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFG在整流流模型中会引起严重的离流形漂移，导致视觉伪影、文本对齐问题和脆弱行为，需要更稳定的引导方法。

Method: 采用自适应预测-校正引导机制：先执行条件整流流更新锚定样本，然后应用加权条件校正，在条件和无条件速度场之间插值。

Result: 在Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina等大规模文本到图像模型上，在MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic、T2I-CompBench等基准数据集上一致优于标准CFG。

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++将整流流的确定性效率与几何感知条件规则相结合，确保轨迹保持在数据流形的有界管状邻域内，提供稳定的引导性能。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

### [13] [PIT-QMM: A Large Multimodal Model For No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07636)
*Shashank Gupta,Gregoire Phillips,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PIT-QMM，一种能够端到端处理文本、图像和点云的新型大型多模态模型，用于无参考点云质量评估，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在图像和视频质量评估方面取得了显著进展，但在3D资产领域尚未充分探索。本研究旨在利用这些模型进行无参考点云质量评估，自动评估点云的感知质量。

Method: 构建PIT-QMM模型，能够端到端消费文本、图像和点云数据来预测质量分数。利用不同模态数据（文本描述、2D投影和3D点云视图）提供的互补信息。

Result: 在流行基准测试中，所提方法以更少的训练迭代次数显著优于现有最先进方法。框架还支持失真定位和识别，为模型可解释性和交互性开辟了新途径。

Conclusion: PIT-QMM在无参考点云质量评估方面表现出色，不仅提升了评估性能，还增强了模型的可解释性和交互能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

### [14] [Dual-Stream Alignment for Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07652)
*Harshala Gammulle,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan,Simon Denman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了双流对齐网络（DSA Net），通过融合帧级和动作级特征来提升动作分割性能，首次引入混合量子-经典机器学习框架，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。

Motivation: 现有动作分割方法主要关注单流建模时空特征，但双流方法能学习动作级特征来提升分割性能。研究探索引入第二流动作特征来捕捉动作和动作转换线索。

Method: 使用双流对齐网络，通过时间上下文块融合互补信息，采用交叉注意力和基于量子的动作引导调制。提出双流对齐损失，包含关系一致性、跨层对比和循环一致性重建损失。

Result: 在GTEA、Breakfast、50Salads和EgoProcel等数据集上评估，通过大量消融研究验证各组件有效性，显著优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 双流对齐网络通过融合帧级和动作级特征，结合量子-经典混合框架，在动作分割任务中表现出色，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio- temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross- attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q- ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid
quantum-classical machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our
primary objective is for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn
a shared feature space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the
proposed Dual-Stream Alignment Loss, which comprises three components:
relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency
reconstruction losses. Following prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several
diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We
further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component through extensive
ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing

TL;DR: OIE方法通过首帧服装替换实现视频虚拟试穿，避免了传统双分支架构在Diffusion Transformer中的参数膨胀问题，在保持领先性能的同时显著提升了参数和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于U-Net的双分支架构在扩散模型中效果显著，但难以适应基于Diffusion Transformer的模型，存在参数过多和服装特征缺乏时序特性等问题。

Method: 采用首帧服装替换策略：先用图像服装转移模型替换首帧服装，然后在编辑后首帧的内容控制下，利用姿态和掩码信息引导视频生成模型顺序合成剩余帧。

Result: 实验表明该方法在参数效率和计算效率方面表现优异，同时在约束条件下仍保持领先性能。

Conclusion: OIE方法提供了一种高效可行的视频虚拟试穿解决方案，成功解决了传统双分支架构在Diffusion Transformer中的适应性问题。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

*James Baker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种使用IP-Adapter自动生成掩码的方法，在推理过程中通过二次处理将图像标记限制在主体区域，让文本提示能够关注图像其余部分，从而提高个性化扩散模型的文本提示对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化扩散模型往往过度关注主体图像而忽略文本提示，导致生成结果只是简单重现主体图像，缺乏与文本提示的准确对齐。

Method: 利用IP-Adapter自动生成的掩码，在第二次处理过程中对图像标记进行掩码操作，将图像标记限制在主体区域，使文本提示能够更好地控制背景和其他图像区域。

Result: 对于描述位置和地点的文本提示，该方法能够生成准确描绘主体同时与提示高度匹配的图像，相比其他测试时个性化方法显示出更高的提示和源图像对齐度。

Conclusion: 通过自动掩码技术限制图像标记到主体区域，有效解决了个性化扩散模型中文本提示被忽视的问题，显著提升了生成图像与文本提示的对齐质量。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

TL;DR: 提出TCIP模型，通过特征增强残差模块(FERM)减少解剖结构错位累积，采用双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略自适应确定迭代次数，在多个医学影像数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金字塔网络在可变形医学图像配准中表现优异，但其解码器架构容易传播和累积解剖结构错位，且现有模型无法自适应确定不同图像所需的迭代次数，导致配准精度下降。

Method: 提出FERM作为金字塔网络解码层的核心组件，包含三个顺序块：提取解剖语义特征、抑制无关特征、估计最终变形场；提出TCI双阶段策略：第一阶段评估配准稳定性，第二阶段评估收敛性。

Result: 在三个脑部MRI数据集和一个腹部CT数据集上的实验表明，TCIP在精度上优于最先进的配准网络，同时保持相当的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数规模。

Conclusion: TCIP通过FERM和TCI有效解决了解剖结构错位累积和迭代次数自适应问题，在医学图像配准中取得了优异性能，且FERM和TCI具有良好的通用性。

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型通常针对固定输入格式训练，无法满足需要混合粒度控制的工作流程需求。

Method: 将任务建模为变分推断，使用多个视频生成骨干网络，通过逐步KL散度最小化和上下文条件化分解技术解决优化挑战。

Result: 实验表明该方法在可控性、多样性和3D一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够为指定元素提供高可控性，同时为未指定元素保持多样性，解决了视频生成中的混合控制需求。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,

BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中心哈希方法在建模全局数据结构方面表现出色，但往往忽视了重要的局部相似性信息。为了克服这一局限性，需要一种能够同时利用全局分布和局部相似性的方法。

Method: 构建了包含强中心分支和弱成对分支的双分支架构，通过迭代式相互学习过程实现知识传递。引入了混合哈希专家模块来促进跨分支的有效交互。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MLH方法持续优于最先进的哈希方法，证明了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: MLH框架成功地将中心方法和成对方法的优势结合起来，通过相互学习和混合专家机制，在图像检索任务中实现了更优的性能。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Repainter框架有效解决了电商图像修复中的关键挑战，提供了可靠的商业应用解决方案，并贡献了大规模数据集和标准化基准。

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

Motivation: 高斯泼溅(GS)虽然能实现沉浸式渲染，但对象与场景的组合存在挑战，因为烘焙的外观和阴影信息会导致不一致。需要可重光照的对象重建和场景光照估计来解决这个问题。

Method: 1. 使用表面八面体探针(SOPs)存储光照和遮挡信息，通过插值实现高效3D查询，避免昂贵的射线追踪；2. 在对象放置位置捕获360度重建辐射场，并微调扩散模型来完成光照估计；3. 提出ComGS框架整合这些技术。

Conclusion: ComGS通过创新的SOPs和光照估计方法，有效解决了3D对象-场景组合的挑战，实现了高效、高质量的实时渲染，为沉浸式3D场景编辑提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出UltraLED框架，仅使用单帧短曝光RAW图像实现超高动态范围重建，通过曝光校正和亮度感知RAW去噪来恢复暗区细节，避免重影和运动模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高动态范围场景中亮暗区域曝光差异大的问题，传统RGB包围曝光方法易产生重影和对齐问题，而单帧短曝光RAW图像具有更高位深和可预测噪声特性，更适合处理此类场景。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先通过比率图进行曝光校正来平衡动态范围，然后使用亮度感知RAW去噪器增强暗区细节恢复。构建了9档包围曝光流程合成真实UHDR图像数据集。

Result: 实验表明UltraLED在单帧方法中表现显著优于现有方法，能够有效恢复暗区细节同时避免重影和运动模糊。

Conclusion: 证明了仅使用单帧短曝光RAW图像即可实现高质量的超高动态范围重建，为动态场景下的HDR成像提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从低帧率RGB视频重建动态3D高斯溅射具有挑战性，因为大帧间运动会增加解空间的不确定性。事件相机能异步捕捉快速视觉变化且对运动模糊鲁棒，但缺乏颜色信息。结合两种模态可以互补优势。

Method: 采用事件运动先验指导变形场优化：1) 使用LoCM无监督微调框架提取事件流中的运动先验；2) 提出几何感知数据关联方法建立事件-高斯运动对应关系；3) 使用运动分解和帧间伪标签策略。

Result: 在合成和真实场景上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有的基于图像和事件的方法，证明事件数据能有效优化动态3D高斯溅射。

Conclusion: 通过结合RGB和事件模态，利用事件运动先验指导变形场优化，成功解决了低帧率视频重建动态3D高斯溅射的挑战，实现了更好的重建效果。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

*Qinghongbing Xie,Zhaoyuan Xia,Feng Zhu,Lijun Gong,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao,Long Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Geo-Temporal Reasoning基准测试(GTR-Bench)，用于评估视觉语言模型在地理时空推理方面的能力，特别是在大规模摄像头网络中追踪移动目标。该基准测试比现有基准更具挑战性，需要在地图和视频之间进行多视角切换，跨多个非重叠视野视频进行联合推理，以及对未观测时空区域进行推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空基准主要关注以自我为中心的图像/视频上下文推理或基于图形上下文的地理视角推理，无法评估视觉语言模型在同时使用图像/视频和图形上下文时的地理时空智能，而这对于交通管理和应急响应等领域至关重要。

Method: 构建GTR-Bench基准测试，要求模型在大规模摄像头网络中进行地理时空推理，包括地图和视频之间的多视角切换、跨多个非重叠视野视频的联合推理，以及对未观测时空区域的推断。

Result: 评估了10多个流行的视觉语言模型，发现即使最佳专有模型Gemini-2.5-Pro(34.9%)也显著落后于人类表现(78.61%)。分析揭示了当前模型的三个主要缺陷：时空上下文利用不平衡、时间预测能力弱、地图与多视角视频输入理解和对齐能力不足。

Conclusion: GTR-Bench为时空智能研究提供了有价值的见解和新的机会，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在地理时空推理方面的显著局限性，为未来模型改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双相位运动表示方法MM-COF和端到端神经网络FMANet，通过整合微表情起始-顶点和顶点-结束两个阶段的运动信息，显著提升了微表情识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微表情识别方法主要关注起始到顶点帧的光流信息，忽略了顶点到结束阶段的运动特征，这限制了识别性能的进一步提升。

Method: 提出MM-COF运动表示方法，整合双相位运动信息；设计FMANet神经网络，内部化双相位分析和幅度调制为可学习模块，自适应融合运动线索并关注重要面部区域。

Result: 在MMEW、SMIC、CASME-II和SAMM四个标准数据集上的实验表明，所提方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 可学习的双相位框架在推进微表情识别方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Conclusion: 提出的基于房间几何约束的深度估计框架能够有效利用几何信息，在360度室内全景深度估计任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

TL;DR: 提出ACAVP方法，通过引入仿射变换和颜色变换增强视觉提示的表达能力，同时使用TrivialAugment数据增强解决过拟合问题，在12个图像分类数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉提示方法存在表达力受限和过拟合问题，导致准确率低于其他适应方法。

Method: ACAVP结合仿射变换（创建任务特定提示区域）、颜色变换（强调任务相关特征）和加法变换，并引入TrivialAugment数据增强。

Result: 在12个数据集上达到视觉提示方法的SOTA准确率，超过线性探测平均准确率，对分布偏移具有更好鲁棒性，推理时计算开销极小。

Conclusion: ACAVP通过增强变换操作和有效数据增强，显著提升了视觉提示方法的性能，同时保持了参数高效的优势。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中多人多物体的复杂交互在现有3D人-物交互基准中只考虑了部分情况，需要更全面的数据集和模型。

Method: 使用端到端基于transformer的神经网络，结合结构化双补丁表示和动作识别来联合估计3D几何、交互和动作。

Result: 在MMHOI和CORE4D数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多HOI建模方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MMHOI数据集和MMHOI-Net模型为下一代HOI研究提供了全面测试平台，能有效建模复杂的多人多物体交互。

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrismGS是一个基于物理正则化的框架，通过金字塔多尺度监督和显式尺寸正则化，解决了3D高斯溅射在大规模城市场景中的走样伪影和优化不稳定问题，在4K渲染下实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在紧凑场景中实现了实时逼真渲染，但在大规模城市场景中会出现严重的走样伪影和优化不稳定问题，特别是在高分辨率渲染下。现有方法虽然解决了可扩展性问题，但未能解决这种保真度差距。

Method: PrismGS集成了两个协同的正则化器：金字塔多尺度监督（通过预滤波图像金字塔强制渲染一致性）和显式尺寸正则化（对3D高斯的尺寸施加物理基础的下界约束）。

Result: 在MatrixCity、Mill-19和UrbanScene3D数据集上的广泛实验表明，PrismGS实现了最先进的性能，相比CityGaussian获得了约1.5 dB的PSNR增益，同时在苛刻的4K渲染下保持了优越的质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PrismGS是一个即插即用的兼容框架，通过物理基础的正则化显著改善了3D高斯的固有渲染行为，解决了大规模城市场景中的走样问题，实现了高质量、稳定的实时渲染。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Conclusion: 该端到端框架能够有效实现从孤立手语视频到语音的直接翻译，提供即时通信能力。

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics
(PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output. Code is

Result: 在标准基准测试中实现了最先进的新视角合成效果，并产生了具有优越几何精度的重建结果。

Conclusion: 利用语义先验作为几何正则化器可以从有限输入视图中产生更连贯和完整的3D模型。

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test
large amounts of compounds. A key component for such systems is the automated

challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via
self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context

TL;DR: XYZCylinder是一个基于统一圆柱提升方法的feedforward模型，通过相机建模和特征提升来解决驾驶场景重建中的泛化能力和精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的feedforward重建范式在重建驾驶场景时泛化能力和重建精度有限，主要原因是：(1)固定视角变换在相机配置变化时失效；(2)稀疏视图的小重叠区域和驾驶场景复杂性增加了学习难度。

Method: 提出统一圆柱相机建模(UCCM)策略避免学习视角依赖的空间对应关系，使用可调参数统一不同相机配置；基于新设计的圆柱平面特征组(CPFG)提出混合表示和专用模块，将2D图像特征提升到3D空间。

Result: 实验结果表明XYZCylinder在不同评估设置下达到了最先进的性能，并能以零样本方式泛化到其他驾驶场景。

Conclusion: XYZCylinder通过统一的圆柱提升方法有效解决了驾驶场景重建中的泛化能力和精度限制问题。

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

Conclusion: MARC在资源受限场景下具有高效实时视频理解的潜力，适用于视频问答、监控和自动驾驶等应用

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly

Conclusion: TTOM是一个有效、实用、可扩展且高效的框架，能够在线实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐，并展现出强大的迁移性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶发展，需要不仅能生成高保真控制视频，还能产生深度估计等多样化有意义信息的模型。

Method: 首先通过辅助4D重建任务微调VAE，增强其编码3D结构和时间动态的能力，然后将该VAE集成到视频扩散过程中提升生成质量。

Result: 实验显示模型在FID和FVD指标上显著提升，联合训练的高斯泼溅解码器能有效重建动态场景，提供有价值的几何信息。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了高质量多视角视频生成与4D场景重建的结合，为全面场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection
tasks. AnimeText on HuggingFace:

Motivation: 降水临近预报对灾害管理、农业、交通和能源优化等社会需求至关重要。现有非自回归方法存在局限性，需要研究预测时间范围对模型的影响，并解决确定性预测的模糊性和分布偏移问题。

Method: 提出SimCast训练流程，采用短到长期知识蒸馏技术和加权MSE损失来关注强降雨区域；进一步将SimCast集成到基于扩散的CasCast框架中，结合概率模型的优势。

Conclusion: 提出的SimCast和CasCast框架有效提升了降水临近预报的准确性，在不增加推理开销的情况下改进了预测性能，并通过概率建模克服了确定性输出的局限性。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Harmony是一个两阶段UHD图像修复框架，通过联合正则化潜在空间和强制高频感知重建来重新定义VAE，在效率和细节保留之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决UHD图像修复中计算效率与高频细节保留之间的权衡问题，传统VAE的高斯约束会丢弃退化特定的高频信息，影响重建保真度。

Method: 第一阶段：提出LH-VAE，通过视觉语义约束和渐进退化扰动增强语义鲁棒性，潜在等变性强化高频重建；第二阶段：联合训练改进的VAE和修复模型，使用高频低秩适应(HF-LoRA)，包括编码器LoRA和解码器LoRA，通过交替优化和选择性梯度传播进行训练。

Result: 实验表明Latent Harmony在UHD和标准分辨率任务上达到最先进性能，有效平衡效率、感知质量和重建精度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过重新定义VAE和引入HF-LoRA机制，成功解决了UHD图像修复中的效率-保真度权衡问题，实现了灵活的质量控制。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在图像隐私分类任务中，当标签预算有限时，抽象标签比对象标签更有效；而当每个图像可用的标签数量较多时，对象相关信息同样有用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在图像隐私这一上下文依赖且具有主观性的任务中，对象标签和抽象标签哪种更适合。对象标签表示具体实体，而抽象标签捕捉更高层次的上下文信息。

Method: 比较对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类中的效果，分析不同标签数量下的性能差异。

Result: 当标签预算有限时，抽象标签比对象标签更有效；当每个图像可用的标签数量较多时，对象相关信息同样有用。

Conclusion: 这些发现将指导未来研究开发更准确的图像隐私分类器，考虑标签类型和数量的作用。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

TL;DR: 比较了Transformer模型SwinIR与轻量级CNN在低光图像恢复任务中的性能效率权衡，发现CNN在仅10个训练周期内达到接近SOTA的性能，且模型大小仅为SwinIR的1/55。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像恢复中高频细节恢复与噪声抑制的挑战，同时探索性能与效率之间的平衡，为实际应用提供更实用的解决方案。

Method: 通过实验对比最先进的SwinIR Transformer模型与标准轻量级CNN模型，在低光图像恢复任务上评估其性能、训练效率和模型大小。

Result: SwinIR达到39.03 dB PSNR峰值性能，但需要132个训练周期；轻量级CNN达到37.4 dB PSNR，仅需10个训练周期，且模型大小比SwinIR小55倍。

Conclusion: 标准CNN能以显著更低的计算开销提供接近SOTA的结果，在资源受限的实际场景中具有明显优势。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Motivation: 事件相机具有低延迟和低能耗优势，适合便携电子设备和移动机器人等资源受限场景，但现有基于RGB相机的方法无法充分利用这些优势。

Method: 使用图神经网络处理事件相机稀疏输出，采用基于线的中间事件表示，结合新颖的偏移向量学习范式和基于置信度的池化方法。

Result: 这是首个将图神经网络应用于事件数据的人体姿态估计工作，实现了高频姿态估计。

Conclusion: GraphEnet成功展示了图神经网络在事件相机人体姿态估计中的有效性，为资源受限应用提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

TL;DR: CIR-CoT是首个集成显式思维链推理的端到端检索导向多模态大语言模型，通过生成可解释的推理链来提升跨模态交互理解，实现更准确和透明的图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有组合图像检索方法作为"黑盒"的问题，缺乏可解释性和处理复杂指令的能力，需要开发透明且能理解细粒度指令的检索系统。

Method: 提出CIR-CoT模型，采用三阶段标注过程（描述、推理、结论）生成结构化思维链数据，通过微调模型生成结构化输出，并将最终检索意图编码到专用嵌入中。

Result: 在领域内数据集（FashionIQ、CIRR）上取得高度竞争力表现，在领域外CIRCO数据集上展现出显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: CIR-CoT为构建更有效和可信赖的检索系统开辟了新路径，通过显式推理链实现了检索过程的透明化和性能提升。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

Motivation: 相机感知系统缺乏显式深度信息，导致3D目标检测难以生成准确预测。为了解决深度估计的模糊性问题，需要开发新的协作感知方法。

Method: 提出RayFusion方法，利用协作车辆的射线占据信息来减少相机射线上的冗余和误报预测，从而增强纯相机协作感知系统的检测能力。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法在协作视觉感知任务中持续优于现有最先进模型，显著提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: RayFusion通过射线融合有效解决了相机协作感知中的深度估计问题，为自动驾驶领域的视觉感知提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

Conclusion: RASALoRE在减少计算复杂度的同时显著提升性能，为弱监督脑异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要大规模配对数据且作为黑盒运行，润色过程不透明，难以适应多样化的用户或图像特定调整需求。

Method: 系统包含视觉批评器（识别输入与参考图像差异）和代码生成器（生成可执行代码），以渐进式多步骤方式润色图像。

Result: 实验表明该方法能很好地泛化到不同润色风格，基于自然语言的用户交互实现了可解释和可控的调整。

Conclusion: RetouchLLM提供了一种无需训练数据、可解释且可控的图像润色解决方案，能够适应用户意图的多样化调整。

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace
dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared
to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at:

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

TL;DR: DarkHash是首个针对深度哈希的无数据后门攻击方法，通过双语义引导的阴影后门攻击框架，在不访问训练数据的情况下植入后门，同时保持原始检索精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中由于隐私保护和知识产权问题，获取训练数据往往不可行，因此需要开发不依赖训练数据的后门攻击方法。

Method: 设计双语义引导的阴影后门攻击框架，仅使用替代数据集微调受害者模型的特定层，并通过拓扑对齐损失优化个体和相邻中毒样本。

Result: 在四个图像数据集、五种模型架构和两种哈希方法上的实验表明，DarkHash具有高有效性，优于现有最先进的后门攻击方法，并能抵御主流防御方法。

Conclusion: DarkHash成功实现了无数据后门攻击，在保持原始检索精度的同时有效植入后门，对深度哈希模型构成新的安全威胁。

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用3D高斯溅射从噪声多视图预测中生成精确分割掩码的标签细化管道，显著提升了极端视角下的人脸解析精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端视角下人脸解析因缺乏标注数据而面临的挑战，避免昂贵的人工标注成本。

Method: 联合拟合两个3DGS模型（RGB图像和初始分割图），通过共享几何实现多视图一致性，合成姿态多样的训练数据。

Result: 在具有挑战性的头部姿态上显著提升了解析精度，同时在标准视图上保持良好性能，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升现实场景中人脸解析的鲁棒性提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案，无需真实3D标注且仅需少量初始图像。

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real- world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像增强方法主要针对自然图像设计，直接应用于CT图像会忽略HU值的物理意义，导致伪影和泛化能力差。需要开发专门针对CT成像特性的增强技术。

Method: 提出随机窗宽窗位增强技术，该技术利用CT图像中HU值的分布特性，通过随机调整窗宽窗位来增强模型对对比度变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了模型在对比度差或扫描时机不佳的挑战性图像上的性能，优于现有的先进方法。

Conclusion: 随机窗宽窗位是一种有效的CT特定增强技术，能够提高深度学习模型在医学图像分割任务中的泛化能力和性能，特别是在肝脏肿瘤分割中表现优异。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Motivation: 解决实时运动可控视频生成的挑战，包括双向扩散模型的固有延迟问题，以及现有自回归方法在少步生成中的质量下降和运动伪影问题。

Method: 首先微调基础I2V模型支持基本运动控制，然后通过强化学习结合基于轨迹的奖励模型进一步优化。采用自展开机制保持马尔可夫性质，并在去噪步骤中选择性引入随机性来加速训练。

Result: 实验表明AR-Drag实现了高视觉保真度和精确的运动对齐，相比最先进的运动可控VDM显著降低延迟，仅使用13亿参数。

Conclusion: AR-Drag成功解决了实时运动可控视频生成的挑战，为高质量、低延迟的视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种注意力增强方法TCAS，通过提高视频语言模型中跨模态注意力头的时间分辨能力，解决模型对重述问题产生逻辑不一致回答的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频语言模型经常对基于其基础输出的重述问题产生自相矛盾的响应，这严重影响了模型的可靠性并阻碍了实际应用。然而，这种现象的根本原因尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用可解释性驱动的方法分析、统计总结并干预这种现象的潜在因素。提出了时间条件注意力锐化(TCAS)方法，基于注意力差异构建增强目标，提升模型的时间分辨率能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了视频语言模型的时间逻辑一致性。可解释性分析证实了该方法确实改善了注意力头的时间辨别能力。此外，在通用视频时间定位任务中也取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 时间逻辑一致性是时间理解的一个瓶颈。通过增强一致性，该方法推动了视频时间理解的显著进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了首个统一的多模态视频超分辨率框架，成功解决了现有方法在多模态条件利用方面的局限性，为高质量视频生成开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Conclusion: MURE框架通过多模态推理显著提升了复杂图像编辑任务的精度和保真度，为视觉编辑提供了更有效的推理方法。

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 自举算法提供了一种有效的几何偏差处理方法，无需依赖对齐训练数据的强假设，在细粒度视觉分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

Motivation: 现有的文本编辑方法难以精确定位对象，而对象拖拽方法仅限于静态重定位，需要一种能够同时解决这两个问题的综合方法。

Method: 将对象拖拽视为图像重建过程，分为两个协同分支：移动重建分支使用基于能量的梯度引导精确移动对象，文本驱动编辑分支共享梯度信号实现一致变换，并采用DDPM反演和先验信息注入来保持对象结构。

Result: 实验表明InstructUDrag能够实现灵活、高保真度的图像编辑，在对象重定位精度和图像内容语义控制方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了文本指令和对象拖拽的优势，为图像编辑提供了更精确和灵活的控制能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

Conclusion: FineDual能够生成细粒度和高质量的双人运动，成功解决了动态层次化交互建模的挑战。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

Conclusion: AdaGC是专门为遥感图像设计的通用单正多标签学习框架，能有效缓解标签噪声过拟合问题

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

TL;DR: NTN-Diff是一种基于频率感知的扩散模型，通过将掩码区域和非掩码区域的语义一致性分解为各频带的一致性，解决了文本引导图像修复中保持非掩码区域和实现语义一致性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时解决文本引导图像修复中的两个关键挑战：保持非掩码区域和实现掩码与非掩码区域的语义一致性。作者观察到这是由于混合频带（如中低频）在去噪过程中对文本提示具有不同鲁棒性导致的。

Method: 提出空文本-空频率感知扩散模型（NTN-Diff），将去噪过程分为早期（高级噪声）和晚期（低级噪声）阶段。在中频带进行文本引导去噪的同时，将其作为指导对低频带进行空文本去噪，随后在晚期阶段进行文本引导去噪，实现跨频带的语义一致性。

Result: 大量实验验证了NTN-Diff在文本引导扩散模型中的优越性，能够有效保持非掩码区域并实现语义一致性。

Conclusion: NTN-Diff通过频带解耦和分阶段去噪策略，成功解决了文本引导图像修复中的关键挑战，为相关领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion

### [67] [A Multimodal Depth-Aware Method For Embodied Reference Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08278)
*Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Dogucan Yaman,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

TL;DR: 提出了一个新颖的ERU框架，通过结合LLM数据增强、深度图模态和深度感知决策模块，在复杂场景中实现更准确的目标物体识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开放词汇目标检测方法在模糊场景中识别多个候选物体时的失败问题

Method: 联合利用LLM数据增强、深度图模态和深度感知决策模块，实现语言和具身线索的鲁棒集成

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，实现了更准确可靠的指称检测

Conclusion: 提出的ERU框架能够有效改善复杂或杂乱环境中的消歧能力

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and
reliable referent detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Neural Exposure Fields (NExF)，通过3D空间中的曝光预测来解决多曝光场景下的神经场景重建问题，在挑战性真实世界数据上实现高质量3D重建和视图合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经场景表示方法在处理包含强烈曝光变化的数据时（如室内外混合场景或有窗户的房间），输出质量会显著下降。需要一种能够鲁棒处理曝光变化的3D重建方法。

Method: 学习预测每个3D点的最佳曝光值的神经场，通过新型神经调节机制联合优化场景表示和曝光场，在3D空间而非图像层面进行曝光优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现最先进性能，比最佳基线方法提升超过55%，训练速度更快，能够准确合成高动态范围场景的视图。

Conclusion: NExF方法通过3D曝光预测有效解决了多曝光场景的神经重建问题，无需后处理或多曝光捕获，在真实世界挑战性数据上表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

### [69] [LTCA: Long-range Temporal Context Attention for Referring Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08305)
*Cilin Yan,Jingyun Wang,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种有效的长程时序上下文注意力机制（LTCA），用于在指代视频分割任务中平衡局部性和全局性，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指代视频分割需要从语言表达和视频的交互中提取长程时序上下文信息来描述对象的动态属性。现有方法要么使用所有帧的注意力，要么堆叠密集局部注意力，但无法很好平衡局部性和全局性，且计算复杂度随视频长度显著增加。

Method: 提出LTCA机制，通过堆叠稀疏局部注意力来平衡局部性和全局性：1）设计跨帧的扩张窗口注意力来聚合局部上下文信息，通过多层堆叠实现全局视图；2）让每个查询关注从全局池中随机选择的一小组键来增强全局性；3）设计全局查询与所有其他查询交互来直接编码全局上下文信息。

Result: 在四个指代视频分割基准测试中达到了新的最先进水平，在MeViS valu和val数据集上分别提升了11.3%和8.3%。

Conclusion: LTCA机制有效平衡了局部性和全局性，显著提升了指代视频分割的性能，同时控制了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

*Yu Huang,Zelin Peng,Changsong Wen,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义基础的学习范式CMAT，将大规模2D视觉基础模型的丰富语义知识迁移到3D领域，并通过CAST模型实现精确的3D可供性分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D可供性分割方法依赖点云编码器作为通用特征提取器，但忽略了3D数据的稀疏性、噪声和几何模糊性等内在挑战，导致学习到的特征缺乏清晰的功能边界。

Method: 提出跨模态亲和力迁移(CMAT)预训练策略，将3D编码器与提升的2D语义对齐，并联合优化重建、亲和力和多样性；在此基础上设计跨模态可供性分割变换器(CAST)，集成多模态提示与CMAT预训练特征。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该框架在3D可供性分割方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过将2D语义知识迁移到3D领域，能够生成语义一致、功能边界清晰的3D可供性分割结果，为机器人操作、具身AI等应用提供更好的支持。

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo是一个高效的无数据后训练框架，通过将自注意力模块替换为线性注意力来加速视频扩散模型，同时保持原始模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算成本随序列长度呈二次方增长，而线性注意力虽然能降低计算成本，但由于表达能力有限和时空建模复杂性，完全替换需要昂贵的预训练。

Method: 提出选择性转移方法，将层选择作为二分类问题自动渐进转换；引入任意时间分布匹配目标，在采样轨迹的任何时间步对齐样本分布。

Result: 方法实现了1.25-2.00倍加速且保持生成质量，4步蒸馏模型进一步实现15.92倍延迟降低且视觉质量下降最小。

Conclusion: LinVideo框架有效解决了视频扩散模型计算效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

TL;DR: 提出了DTPQA基准，专门评估自动驾驶场景中视觉语言模型的感知能力，发现当前小型VLM在交通场景感知任务上表现远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要可靠的感知能力，特别是在安全关键应用中。由于关键交通对象通常位于远处，需要系统具备远距离感知能力。

Method: 创建了DTPQA基准，专注于交通场景中的纯感知问题，排除推理问题，并添加距离标注。评估了多个先进的小型VLM在该基准上的表现。

Result: 最佳小型VLM的平均准确率约为60%，远低于人类约85%的表现。模型在区分左右等特定感知任务上表现特别差。

Conclusion: 当前小型VLM在交通场景感知方面仍有显著差距，特别是在远距离感知和方向辨别等任务上，需要进一步改进才能满足自动驾驶应用的需求。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Motivation: 解决低光照图像和雾霾图像（包括雾天、沙尘、水下图像）的增强和清晰化问题，旨在提供一种简单有效的解决方案。

Method: 构建图像滤波器模拟低光或雾霾条件，然后推导近似反向滤波器来最小化增强图像中的失真。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在处理极暗图像和增强雾霾图像方面具有高度竞争力，甚至优于现有最先进技术。

Conclusion: 该方法的主要优势在于其简单性，仅需几行MATLAB代码即可实现，为图像增强提供了一种高效且易于实现的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater
images). Our method involves constructing an image filter to simulate low-light
or hazy conditions and deriving approximate reverse filters to minimize
distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach
is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in
handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of
our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a
few lines of MATLAB code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新一代高光谱卫星传感器和深度学习方法虽然提升了土地覆盖分类能力，但在小标注数据集上训练网络时存在过拟合风险。

Method: 使用引导扩散模型进行数据增强，结合轻量级Transformer网络、改进的加权损失函数和优化的余弦方差调度器，实现小数据集上的快速有效训练。

Result: 在PRISMA卫星获取的10种森林类型高光谱图像分类任务中，该方法在平均精度和加权平均精度上均优于其他数据增强技术，且模型训练行为稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了深度生成模型在实际应用中数据增强的常见限制，为小样本高光谱图像分类提供了稳定有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

TL;DR: UniVideo是一个统一的多模态视频生成和编辑框架，采用双流设计结合MLLM和MMDiT，在多种视频任务上达到或超越专用模型性能，并支持任务组合和跨任务泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统一多模态模型主要局限于图像领域，视频领域的统一建模研究较少，需要开发能够处理复杂多模态指令并保持视觉一致性的视频生成框架。

Method: 采用双流架构：多模态大语言模型(MLLM)用于理解指令，多模态DiT(MMDiT)用于视频生成。通过多任务联合训练统一处理各种视频生成和编辑任务。

Result: 在文本/图像到视频生成、上下文视频生成和编辑等任务上达到或超越最先进的专用基线模型。支持任务组合和跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniVideo证明了统一视频建模的可行性，能够处理复杂多模态指令并实现任务间的能力迁移，为未来视频生成研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合LayoutLMv3和GPT-4o的方法，通过边界框预测检测和链接历史地图图例项及其描述，实现结构化解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图图例对解释地图符号至关重要，但其布局不一致和非结构化格式使得自动提取具有挑战性。现有方法主要关注分割或通用OCR，很少有方法能有效匹配图例符号及其描述。

Method: 使用LayoutLMv3进行布局检测，结合GPT-4o通过上下文学习检测和链接图例项及其描述，利用边界框预测实现结构化匹配。

Result: 实验显示GPT-4配合结构化JSON提示优于基线，达到88% F-1分数和85% IoU，并揭示了提示设计、示例数量和布局对齐对性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法支持可扩展的、布局感知的图例解析，提高了各种视觉风格历史地图的索引和可搜索性。

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various
visual styles.

Motivation: 解决医学图像数据隐私和安全问题，现有源自由域自适应方法主要关注伪标签精炼而忽略了学习过程，渐进式学习过程有助于知识迁移。

Method: 设计了两种课程：易到难课程从简单样本开始学习并逐步增加难度；源到目标课程确保从源域到目标域的平滑迁移。

Result: 在眼底分割和息肉分割的跨域数据集上评估，实验结果表明该方法超越了现有方法并达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: LFC框架通过课程学习策略有效解决了源自由域自适应问题，在医学图像分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估最先进的文本到视频模型时存在三个主要问题：1）现有评估维度无法区分顶尖模型；2）缺乏对事件级时间因果关系的评估；3）缺乏对世界知识的系统性评估。

Method: 收集跨多个领域的代表性视频，提取具有固有时间因果关系的事件级描述，由独立标注者重写为文本到视频提示。为每个提示设计包含10个维度的二元评估问题，总共包含300个精心策划的提示、815个事件和793个评估问题。

Conclusion: VideoVerse基准测试为评估文本到视频模型是否能够理解复杂时间因果关系和世界知识提供了全面框架，有助于分析当前文本到视频生成器与世界模型之间的差距。

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

TL;DR: 本文首次将连续时间一致性蒸馏扩展到通用应用级图像和视频扩散模型，提出了score-regularized连续时间一致性模型(rCM)，通过集成score蒸馏作为长跳连接正则化器，在保持高生成多样性的同时显著提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管连续时间一致性模型(sCM)在加速学术规模扩散方面具有理论优势和实证能力，但其在大规模文本到图像和视频任务中的适用性仍不明确，主要面临Jacobian-vector乘积计算的基础设施挑战和标准评估基准的局限性。

Method: 开发了并行兼容的FlashAttention-2 JVP核，支持超过100亿参数模型和高维视频任务的sCM训练；提出rCM模型，将score蒸馏作为长跳连接正则化器集成到sCM中，结合'模式覆盖'的前向散度和'模式寻求'的反向散度。

Result: 在高达140亿参数的Cosmos-Predict2、Wan2.1等大规模模型和5秒视频上验证，rCM在质量指标上匹配或超越最先进的蒸馏方法DMD2，同时在多样性方面具有显著优势，仅需1-4步即可生成高保真样本，加速扩散采样15-50倍。

Conclusion: rCM作为一个实用且理论基础的框架，为推进大规模扩散蒸馏提供了有效解决方案，无需GAN调优或大量超参数搜索。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

Conclusion: 基于回报差异的注意力机制能够有效识别任务相关特征，显著提升视觉强化学习的样本效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

*Noor Islam S. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个模块化空间图像处理框架，集成了灰度量化、色彩增强、图像锐化、双向变换管道和几何特征提取等功能，在多个数据集上展现出稳健的确定性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个综合性的图像处理框架，能够处理从基础量化到高级特征提取的多种任务，满足实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的需求。

Method: 采用模块化设计，包括灰度量化（8级离散化）、色彩增强（RGB和YCrCb空间的直方图均衡化）、亮度调整（HSV值通道操作）、图像锐化（3×3卷积核）、双向变换管道（非锐化掩模、伽马校正、噪声放大）以及几何特征提取（Canny边缘检测、Hough线估计、Harris角点检测、形态学窗口定位）。

Result: 双向变换管道在正向和反向过程中分别达到76.10%和74.80%的准确率；Hough线估计成功检测到51.50°的台球杆对齐角度；杆隔离与真实图像相比达到81.87%的相似度。

Conclusion: 该框架在多样化数据集上表现出稳健和确定性的性能，显示了在实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用中的潜力。

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉-文本推理中存在文本先验依赖问题，难以在开放词汇场景中区分语义相似的动作

Method: 将动作分解为可区分的子动作进行细粒度匹配，同时动态调用领域特定工具进行跨模态交错，通过分层奖励平衡工具使用效率、子动作相关性和结构连贯性

Conclusion: 该方法实现了从文本中心推理到视觉基础推理的转变，展现出优秀的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于视频的视觉象似性挑战基准，评估视觉语言模型在手语象似性任务上的表现，发现模型在语音形式预测和透明度任务上表现不如人类，但在象似性评分上与人类有一定相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语中的象似性（形式与意义的相似性）为视觉基础提供了自然测试平台，需要评估视觉语言模型从动态人体运动中恢复这种基本映射的能力。

Method: 引入视觉象似性挑战基准，采用心理语言学测量方法，评估13个最先进的视觉语言模型在三个任务上的表现：语音符号形式预测、透明度推理和分级象似性评分。

Result: 模型在语音形式预测中能恢复部分手形和位置细节但低于人类表现；在透明度任务上远不如人类基线；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评分有中等相关性。有趣的是，语音形式预测更强的模型与人类象似性判断相关性更好。

Conclusion: 验证了这些诊断任务的有效性，并激励采用以人为中心的信号和具身学习方法，以建模象似性并改进多模态模型中的视觉基础。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries present significant diagnostic challenges in
emergency medicine, where the timely interpretation of medical images is
crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based
approach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma
cases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to
capture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The
AC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate
anomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates
coherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range
dependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial
Hemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models
in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only
supports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a
powerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback
and enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential
of combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation
to improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain
injuries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频常因采集和传输条件不同而遭受复杂退化（如噪声、压缩伪影、低光失真），现有方法需要专业手动选择专用模型或采用无法泛化到不同退化的单体架构。

Method: 构建大规模高分辨率视频退化识别基准，使用视觉语言模型驱动退化识别器；引入基于大语言模型的自适应路由器，通过观察工具使用模式自主学习有效修复策略；构建Res-VQ数据集并设计专用的VLM视频质量评估模型。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了在多模态智能和模块化推理集成在通用视频修复系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文发现视觉变换器(ViT)中存在一类高范数视觉标记(ViT注意力汇聚点)，这些标记包含图像的高级语义概念，对大型视觉语言模型的理解和推理至关重要。通过利用这些标记，可以显著提升视觉推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM中的注意力汇聚点，但很少研究ViT视觉编码器中的注意力汇聚点。这些ViT汇聚点包含重要语义信息，但在现有LVLM架构中经常被忽视，因此需要探索它们对视觉推理的贡献。

Method: 提出了定性和定量分析ViT汇聚点中嵌入的信息，并开发了免训练和基于训练的方法来更好地利用这些信息。通过显式利用这些标记来增强视觉推理能力。

Result: 通过显式利用ViT注意力汇聚点，在一系列LVLM和视觉推理任务上展示了显著的性能提升，证明了这些标记在增强视觉推理方面的未开发潜力。

Conclusion: ViT注意力汇聚点包含关键的语义信息，通过适当利用这些标记可以显著提升大型视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力，这为LVLM架构优化提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Conclusion: 该框架为带宽受限环境下的3D点云传输提供了高效解决方案，在保持数据质量的同时显著减少传输数据量，支持各种机器人应用。

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

Conclusion: 本文通过理论分析和实证验证，为参数高效微调提供了理论基础，并提出了一种无需引入新参数的高效微调方法，架起了理论与实践的桥梁。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频生成方法在轨迹控制方面存在局限性，需要更灵活和高效的方式来控制视频中点的运动轨迹。

Method: 使用统一的点运动表示（分割ID、轨迹ID、颜色通道），采用序列拼接方案而非ControlNet，并采用退火训练策略逐步减少对完整监督的依赖。

Result: 实现了多粒度、对齐无关的轨迹控制，支持运动克隆、拖拽式图像到视频、运动插值、相机重定向等多种应用。

Conclusion: FlexTraj在轨迹控制的灵活性、收敛速度和推理效率方面表现出色，为视频生成提供了强大的轨迹控制能力。

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在根本性挑战，主要原因是缺乏从感知到理解的层次化基础。

Method: 三阶段渐进训练框架：1)通过目标定位建立空间感知；2)通过多维空间任务发展空间理解；3)通过可验证奖励的强化学习加强复杂推理。

Result: SpatialLadder模型在空间推理基准上平均提升23.4%，超越GPT-4o 20.8%和Gemini-2.0-Flash 10.1%，在域外基准上保持7.2%的泛化提升。

Conclusion: 从感知到推理的渐进式训练对于构建鲁棒的空间智能至关重要。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Motivation: 仅依赖文本指令限制了编辑程度的精细控制，需要提供更细粒度的编辑强度调节能力。

Method: 扩展现有图像编辑模型，添加标量编辑强度输入，训练轻量级投影网络将标量和编辑指令映射到模型调制空间的系数，使用生成模型合成多样化训练数据。

Conclusion: Kontinuous Kontext为指令驱动编辑提供了统一的细粒度控制方法，实现了平滑连续的编辑强度调节。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MM-HELIX基准测试来评估多模态大语言模型的长链反思推理能力，并开发了AHPO训练策略来显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但在需要迭代思考和回溯的复杂长链反思推理方面能力不足，这限制了其解决复杂现实问题的能力。

Method: 首先构建MM-HELIX基准测试，包含1,260个挑战性任务；然后开发Step-Elicited Response Generation管道创建MM-HELIX-100K数据集；最后提出自适应混合策略优化(AHPO)训练策略，将离线监督和在线优化动态统一。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B基线上，该方法在MM-HELIX基准上实现了+18.6%的准确率提升，在通用数学和逻辑任务上平均性能提升+5.7%。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型的反思推理能力可以通过有效学习得到显著提升，这为开发更强大的多模态模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

*Nikhil Reddy Varimalla,Yunfei Xu,Arkadiy Saakyan,Meng Fan Wang,Smaranda Muresan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNorms是一个包含1000多个视频片段-规范对的文化基准数据集，用于评估视频大语言模型的文化意识，涵盖中美文化背景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在全球部署，需要评估其对相关文化背景的理解和基础能力，但目前缺乏合适的基准测试。

Method: 采用人机协作框架构建数据集：使用基于理论提示的教师模型生成候选标注，由训练有素的人类专家验证和修正。

Result: 基准测试显示模型存在多个问题：对规范违反的识别差于遵守、对中国文化的表现差于美国文化、提供非语言证据困难、在正式非幽默语境中表现更差。

Conclusion: 研究发现视频语言模型需要文化基础训练，VideoNorms基准和框架开始填补这一空白。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

TL;DR: ARTDECO是一个统一的3D重建框架，结合前馈模型效率和SLAM可靠性，使用3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，通过高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，实现实时高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目图像序列实时3D重建的挑战，现有方法在精度和效率之间存在权衡：逐场景优化精度高但计算昂贵，前馈基础模型实时但精度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 使用3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，结合高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，设计分层高斯表示和LoD感知渲染策略以提高渲染质量并减少冗余。

Result: 在8个多样化室内外基准测试中，ARTDECO实现了与SLAM相当的交互性能、与前馈系统相似的鲁棒性，以及接近逐场景优化的重建质量。

Conclusion: ARTDECO为实时数字化真实世界环境提供了实用路径，兼具准确几何和高视觉保真度。

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

*Yunzhe Xu,Yiyuan Pan,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memoir提出了一种基于想象力的记忆检索机制，通过世界模型想象未来状态作为查询，选择性检索环境观察和行为历史，在记忆持久性视觉语言导航任务中取得了显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆持久性VLN方法存在关键限制：缺乏有效的记忆访问机制，依赖整体记忆整合或固定范围查找，且主要存储环境观察而忽略编码有价值决策策略的导航行为模式。

Method: 1) 语言条件世界模型想象未来状态，用于编码经验和生成检索查询；2) 混合视角级记忆，将观察和行为模式锚定到视角，实现混合检索；3) 经验增强导航模型，通过专用编码器整合检索知识。

Result: 在10个不同测试场景的多样化记忆持久性VLN基准测试中，Memoir在所有场景均显著改进，在IR2R上比最佳记忆持久性基线提升5.4% SPL，同时实现8.3倍训练加速和74%推理内存减少。

Conclusion: 预测性检索环境和行为记忆可实现更有效的导航，分析表明这种想象力引导范式具有巨大改进空间（73.3% vs 93.4%上限）。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

TL;DR: VideoCanvas是一个新颖的视频生成框架，通过零参数修改实现了任意时空视频补全，将多种可控视频生成任务统一到单一范式下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代潜在视频扩散模型中由因果VAE引入的时间模糊性问题，实现像素级精确的帧级条件控制。

Method: 采用混合条件策略：空间控制通过零填充处理，时间对齐通过时间RoPE插值实现，为每个条件分配连续分数位置。

Result: 在VideoCanvasBench基准测试中显著优于现有条件范式，建立了灵活统一视频生成的新技术水平。

Conclusion: VideoCanvas成功解决了VAE的时间模糊性问题，实现了像素帧感知控制，为可控视频生成提供了统一且灵活的方法。

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Motivation: 当前视频基准主要针对通用场景，依赖感知/识别而推理任务相对简单，导致性能饱和，无法有效评估先进的多模态认知技能。

Method: 构建包含1000个多选题的基准，问题源自前沿科学实验视频，涵盖25+专业学科，通过半自动系统验证，要求领域知识、时空感知和复杂逻辑推理。

Result: 评估显示最先进的专有和开源LMMs（包括Gemini 2.5 Pro和Qwen2.5-VL）存在显著性能缺陷，表明视频推理能力有大幅提升空间。

Conclusion: SciVideoBench填补了科学视频推理评估的关键空白，为LMMs未来发展提供了宝贵见解和明确方向，推动真正有能力多模态AI的发展。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多模态控制的视频插帧框架，通过深度转换、运动轨迹、文本提示和区域定位等多种控制方式，实现灵活、精确的视频插值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频插帧方法无法生成大型、复杂或精细的运动，缺乏对中间帧细节的精细控制，难以满足用户多样化的创意需求。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer架构，将所有运动控制映射为统一的点基表示，将内容控制和运动控制分离为两个分支，并采用分阶段训练策略。

Result: 多模态控制实现了更动态、可定制和上下文准确的视觉叙事，在定性和定量实验中表现出色。

Conclusion: 多模态控制为视频插帧提供了更高的灵活性和精确性，能够更好地满足用户的创意需求。

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResAD提出了一种归一化残差轨迹建模框架，通过预测与确定性惯性参考的残差偏差来解决端到端自动驾驶中的时空不平衡问题，显著简化学习任务并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统面临轨迹数据固有时空不平衡的挑战，这导致模型学习虚假相关性而非因果推理，同时优先考虑不确定的远距离预测而危及即时安全。

Method: ResAD框架将学习任务重新定义为预测与确定性惯性参考的残差偏差，并使用点级归一化对预测残差进行重新加权，防止大误差主导学习信号。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ResAD使用仅有两个去噪步骤的普通扩散策略实现了88.6的最优PDMS，表明该方法显著简化学习任务并提升模型性能。

Conclusion: ResAD通过残差轨迹建模和点级归一化有效解决了端到端自动驾驶中的优化不平衡问题，为因果推理提供了更好的学习框架。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

Motivation: 现有MLLM采用组合式训练范式，将预训练视觉编码器与预训练LLM连接，但这种分离训练难以探索多模态扩展特性。本文旨在研究原生端到端训练的MLLM。

Method: 在数据约束的实际设置下，系统研究MLLM的设计空间和扩展特性，找到性能与训练成本最佳平衡的元架构，探索视觉编码器与LLM的正相关扩展关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来原生MLLM研究提供了深入见解，证实了视觉编码器与LLM之间的正相关扩展关系。

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

Conclusion: D²GS框架有效解决了稀疏视角3D高斯泼溅的过拟合和欠拟合问题，并引入了新的评估指标来量化学习高斯分布的稳定性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

TL;DR: ReSplat是一种前馈循环高斯溅射模型，通过迭代细化3D高斯而不显式计算梯度，利用渲染误差作为反馈信号来指导高斯更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统前馈高斯溅射模型在推理时仅依赖单次前向传递，性能受到根本限制。需要一种能够迭代优化且无需显式梯度计算的方法。

Method: 提出循环高斯溅射模型，使用渲染误差作为反馈信号指导高斯更新；引入紧凑重建模型在16倍下采样空间初始化，大幅减少高斯数量；通过循环网络学习有效的高斯更新策略。

Result: 在多种输入视图(2,8,16)、分辨率(256×256到540×960)和数据集(DL3DV、RealEstate10K)上的实验表明，该方法达到最先进性能，同时显著减少高斯数量并提高渲染速度。

Conclusion: ReSplat通过循环反馈机制和紧凑初始化策略，实现了高效的高斯溅射渲染，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了计算开销。

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project
