### [1] [Vision-Based Perception for Autonomous Vehicles in Off-Road Environment Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19378)
*Nelson Alves Ferreira Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非铺装道路和越野环境的感知系统CMSNet，能够实现实时语义分割，并发布了包含近12,000张图像的新数据集Kamino。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为露天矿场和发展中国家的自动驾驶系统提供低延迟智能感知能力，使车辆能够在没有预定义路径的崎岖地形上导航。

Method: 开发了可配置模块化分割网络（CMSNet）框架，通过系统性地移除和融合CNN层，使用TensorRT、C++和CUDA实现实时推理。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实证实验验证了系统的有效性，能够在恶劣条件下（夜间、雨天、灰尘）准确分割障碍物和可通行地面。

Conclusion: CMSNet框架为越野环境下的自动驾驶提供了有效的实时感知解决方案，Kamino数据集为相关研究提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on
non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work
proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and
off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined
trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is
proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet
configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new
images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain,
dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions
without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility
impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A
new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating
vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number
of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images
from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To
achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and
fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets
validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

### [2] [Overview of LifeCLEF Plant Identification task 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19402)
*Herve Goeau,Pierre Bonnet,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LifeCLEF 2020植物识别挑战评估了如何利用植物标本馆收藏来改进数据匮乏地区（如热带地区）的植物自动识别，通过跨域分类任务结合标本馆样本和野外照片进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决植物自动识别在生物多样性丰富但数据匮乏的热带地区的局限性，利用植物标本馆收藏的数百万数字化标本作为补充数据源。

Method: 采用跨域分类方法，训练集包含数十万标本馆样本和数千张野外照片，测试集仅包含野外照片，学习两个领域之间的映射关系。

Result: 评估了基于南美洲圭亚那地盾约1000种植物的数据集，该地区拥有全球最丰富的植物多样性之一。

Conclusion: 植物标本馆收藏可以作为改进热带地区植物自动识别的重要数据资源，跨域学习方法有助于弥合标本馆样本与野外照片之间的领域差异。

Abstract: Automated identification of plants has improved considerably thanks to the
recent progress in deep learning and the availability of training data with
more and more photos in the field. However, this profusion of data only
concerns a few tens of thousands of species, mostly located in North America
and Western Europe, much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity
such as tropical countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists
have collected, catalogued and systematically stored plant specimens in
herbaria, particularly in tropical regions, and the recent efforts by the
biodiversity informatics community made it possible to put millions of
digitized sheets online. The LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge (or
"PlantCLEF 2020") was designed to evaluate to what extent automated
identification on the flora of data deficient regions can be improved by the
use of herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species
mainly focused on the South America's Guiana Shield, an area known to have one
of the greatest diversity of plants in the world. The challenge was evaluated
as a cross-domain classification task where the training set consist of several
hundred thousand herbarium sheets and few thousand of photos to enable learning
a mapping between the two domains. The test set was exclusively composed of
photos in the field. This paper presents the resources and assessments of the
conducted evaluation, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the
participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

### [3] [iFinder: Structured Zero-Shot Vision-Based LLM Grounding for Dash-Cam Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19552)
*Manyi Yao,Bingbing Zhuang,Sparsh Garg,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Christian Shelton,Manmohan Chandraker,Abhishek Aich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFinder是一个结构化语义基础框架，用于后处理行车记录仪视频分析，通过将视频转换为分层可解释数据结构，让LLM能够进行空间推理和因果推断，在零样本驾驶基准上显著优于端到端视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在行车记录仪视频分析中缺乏空间推理、因果推断和可解释性的问题，特别是当视觉是唯一可用模态时。

Method: 采用模块化、无需训练的方法，使用预训练视觉模型提取关键线索（物体姿态、车道位置、物体轨迹），组织成层次化结构，结合三块提示策略实现逐步推理。

Result: 在四个公开行车记录仪基准测试中，iFinder显著优于端到端V-VLMs，事故推理准确率提升高达39%。

Conclusion: 通过为LLM提供驾驶领域特定表示，iFinder为零样本、可解释、可靠的后处理驾驶视频理解提供了替代方案。

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc
dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose
training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole
modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing
video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning,
causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end,
we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples
perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical,
interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular,
training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract
critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which
are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined
with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning
for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning.
Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's
proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and
global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot
driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By
grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a
zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for
post-hoc driving video understanding.

### [4] [CURE: Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure for Facial Recognition Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19562)
*Fnu Shivam,Nima Najafzadeh,Yenumula Reddy,Prashnna Gyawali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CURE是首个用于人脸识别系统的无监督遗忘框架，无需身份标签即可选择性移除特定用户数据的影响，同时保持模型整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸识别系统广泛使用但引发隐私担忧，现有机器遗忘技术依赖监督方法需要身份标签，这在隐私受限或大规模噪声数据集中往往不可用。

Method: 提出CURE（Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure）无监督遗忘框架，通过质心引导的无监督表示擦除技术移除目标样本，同时提出新的评估指标UES（Unlearning Efficiency Score）来平衡遗忘和保持稳定性。

Result: CURE显著优于现有遗忘方法的无监督变体，并在将低质量图像指定为遗忘集的质量感知遗忘实验中展示了其可用性和优势。

Conclusion: CURE填补了无监督机器遗忘的关键空白，证明了图像质量在机器遗忘中的重要作用，为人脸识别系统的隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the current digital era, facial recognition systems offer significant
utility and have been widely integrated into modern technological
infrastructures; however, their widespread use has also raised serious privacy
concerns, prompting regulations that mandate data removal upon request. Machine
unlearning has emerged as a powerful solution to address this issue by
selectively removing the influence of specific user data from trained models
while preserving overall model performance. However, existing machine
unlearning techniques largely depend on supervised techniques requiring
identity labels, which are often unavailable in privacy-constrained situations
or in large-scale, noisy datasets. To address this critical gap, we introduce
CURE (Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure), the first
unsupervised unlearning framework for facial recognition systems that operates
without the use of identity labels, effectively removing targeted samples while
preserving overall performance. We also propose a novel metric, the Unlearning
Efficiency Score (UES), which balances forgetting and retention stability,
addressing shortcomings in the current evaluation metrics. CURE significantly
outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods. Additionally,
we conducted quality-aware unlearning by designating low-quality images as the
forget set, demonstrating its usability and benefits, and highlighting the role
of image quality in machine unlearning.

### [5] [Synthesizing Artifact Dataset for Pixel-level Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19589)
*Dennis Menn,Feng Liang,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种自动注入伪影到高质量合成图像的方法，无需人工标注即可生成像素级注释，从而训练更有效的伪影检测器


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的伪影检测器需要昂贵的像素级人工标注来指定伪影区域，缺乏标注数据限制了检测器性能，而传统的伪标签方法存在噪声标签问题

Method: 设计一个伪影污染流程，自动将伪影注入到干净的高质量合成图像的预定区域，无需人工标注即可生成像素级注释

Result: 该方法训练的伪影检测器在ConvNeXt上性能提升13.2%，在Swin-T上提升3.7%，优于基线方法

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现可扩展的像素级伪影标注数据集迈出了第一步，将世界知识整合到伪影检测中

Abstract: Artifact detectors have been shown to enhance the performance of
image-generative models by serving as reward models during fine-tuning. These
detectors enable the generative model to improve overall output fidelity and
aesthetics. However, training the artifact detector requires expensive
pixel-level human annotations that specify the artifact regions. The lack of
annotated data limits the performance of the artifact detector. A naive
pseudo-labeling approach-training a weak detector and using it to annotate
unlabeled images-suffers from noisy labels, resulting in poor performance. To
address this, we propose an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically
injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on a predetermined
region, thereby producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling. The
proposed method enables training of an artifact detector that achieves
performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T, as verified
on human-labeled data, compared to baseline approaches. This work represents an
initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that
integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.

### [6] [Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Learning via Progressive Task-Specific Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19602)
*Neeraj Gangwar,Anshuka Rangi,Rishabh Deshmukh,Holakou Rahmanian,Yesh Dattatreya,Nickvash Kani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式任务特定的多任务适配方法，通过在预训练模型中引入适配器模块，初始层共享所有任务，后续层逐渐变得任务特定，以减少任务冲突并提高参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决参数高效微调方法在多任务学习中面临的任务干扰和负迁移问题，由于可训练参数数量有限，这些问题在多任务学习中更加严重。

Method: 在预训练模型中引入适配器模块，初始层共享所有任务，后续层逐渐任务特定化；提出基于梯度的任务相似性计算方法，将相似任务分配到共享适配器模块。

Result: 在PASCAL和NYUD-v2数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于完全微调的多任务模型，仅需五分之一的训练参数，在参数高效多任务学习方面超越了当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过渐进式任务特定适配和任务相似性分配，有效解决了多任务学习中的任务冲突问题，在保持参数效率的同时实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged as a promising solution
for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. While these
methods perform well in single-task learning, extending them to multi-task
learning exacerbates common challenges, such as task interference and negative
transfer, due to the limited number of trainable parameters. To address these
issues, we introduce progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation, a novel
parameter-efficient approach for multi-task learning. This approach introduces
adapter modules in a pre-trained model such that these modules are shared
across all tasks in the initial layers and become progressively more
task-specific in the later layers. The motivation is to reduce the conflicts
among tasks by allowing transfer learning across all tasks in the initial
layers and enabling task-specific learning toward the prediction heads.
Additionally, we propose a gradient-based approach for computing task
similarity and use this measure to allocate similar tasks to the shared adapter
modules. Our task similarity method introduces minimal overhead in the
pipeline. We evaluate our approach by adapting the Swin Transformer for dense
prediction tasks. Experiments on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms a fully fine-tuned multi-task model while
requiring only one-fifth of the trainable parameters. This approach achieves
better relative improvement to single-task fine-tuning while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and surpasses the current state-of-the-art
methods for parameter-efficient multi-task learning.

### [7] [Raw-JPEG Adapter: Efficient Raw Image Compression with JPEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19624)
*Mahmoud Afifi,Ran Zhang,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出RawJPEG Adapter，一种轻量级、可学习且可逆的预处理流水线，将原始图像适配为标准JPEG压缩，通过变换和参数存储实现高保真重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始数据（如DNG格式）保留完整传感器信息但存储需求大，而JPEG格式压缩效率高但不适于原始存储。需要一种方法在保持JPEG优势的同时支持原始数据重建。

Method: 应用空间和可选频域变换，将紧凑参数存储在JPEG注释字段中，实现可逆的原始图像适配JPEG压缩。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法比直接JPEG存储具有更高保真度，支持其他编解码器，并在压缩比和重建精度之间提供有利权衡。

Conclusion: RawJPEG Adapter为受限场景下的原始图像存储提供了一种实用解决方案，平衡了压缩效率和重建质量。

Abstract: Digital cameras digitize scene light into linear raw representations, which
the image signal processor (ISP) converts into display-ready outputs. While raw
data preserves full sensor information--valuable for editing and vision
tasks--formats such as Digital Negative (DNG) require large storage, making
them impractical in constrained scenarios. In contrast, JPEG is a widely
supported format, offering high compression efficiency and broad compatibility,
but it is not well-suited for raw storage. This paper presents RawJPEG Adapter,
a lightweight, learnable, and invertible preprocessing pipeline that adapts raw
images for standard JPEG compression. Our method applies spatial and optional
frequency-domain transforms, with compact parameters stored in the JPEG comment
field, enabling accurate raw reconstruction. Experiments across multiple
datasets show that our method achieves higher fidelity than direct JPEG
storage, supports other codecs, and provides a favorable trade-off between
compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.

### [8] [The Impact of 2D Segmentation Backbones on Point Cloud Predictions Using 4D Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19644)
*William L. Muckelroy III,Mohammed Alsakabi,John M. Dolan,Ozan K. Tonguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了更高容量的分割骨干网络对使用4D雷达生成LiDAR类点云质量的影响，发现最优分割骨干网络相比现有最优方法可提升23.7%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR成本高昂限制了高级自动驾驶系统的广泛应用，研究旨在通过使用4D雷达替代LiDAR来生成高质量的点云表示。

Method: 使用更高容量的分割骨干网络来改进现有的神经网络方法，该方法使用LiDAR点云作为真值，仅使用4D雷达生成LiDAR类3D点云。

Result: 研究发现虽然极高容量的模型可能损害性能，但最优分割骨干网络相比现有最优方法可提供23.7%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 选择适当容量的分割骨干网络对于提升4D雷达生成点云的质量至关重要，过高容量反而可能降低性能。

Abstract: LiDAR's dense, sharp point cloud (PC) representations of the surrounding
environment enable accurate perception and significantly improve road safety by
offering greater scene awareness and understanding. However, LiDAR's high cost
continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD)
systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress
towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using
LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds
using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to
train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional
neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that
uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we
investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality
of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity
models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can
provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).

### [9] [Bias in the Picture: Benchmarking VLMs with Social-Cue News Images and LLM-as-Judge Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19659)
*Aravind Narayanan,Vahid Reza Khazaie,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新闻图像基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在存在视觉线索时吸收和复制有害社会刻板印象的风险。研究发现视觉上下文会系统性地影响模型输出，不同属性和模型的偏见程度不同，且更高的忠实度不一定对应更低的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型能够联合解释图像和文本，但也容易在存在年龄、性别、种族、服装或职业等视觉线索时吸收和复制有害的社会刻板印象。为了调查这些风险，需要建立一个评估基准。

Method: 引入一个包含1,343个图像-问题对的新闻图像基准测试，从多样化媒体来源收集，并标注了真实答案和人口统计属性。评估了多种最先进的视觉语言模型，并使用大型语言模型作为评判者，辅以人工验证。

Result: 研究发现：(i) 视觉上下文在开放式设置中会系统性地改变模型输出；(ii) 不同属性和模型的偏见流行程度不同，性别和职业的风险特别高；(iii) 更高的忠实度不一定对应更低的偏见。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了视觉语言模型在存在视觉线索时的偏见风险，并发布了基准测试提示、评估标准和代码，以支持可重复和关注公平性的多模态评估。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) can jointly interpret images and text,
but they are also prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes
when visual cues such as age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation are
present. To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark
consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we
annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender,
race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and
employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our
findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in
open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models,
with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher
faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the
benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and
fairness-aware multimodal assessment.

### [10] [MoTiC: Momentum Tightness and Contrast for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19664)
*Zeyu He,Shuai Huang,Yuwu Lu,Ming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MoTiC框架，通过贝叶斯分析将新类先验与旧类统计对齐来减少方差，并结合大规模对比学习增强特征紧密度，以解决少样本类增量学习中的估计偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FSCIL方法使用冻结特征提取器和类平均原型来缓解灾难性遗忘和过拟合，但新类原型因数据稀缺而存在显著估计偏差，而基类原型则有足够数据支持。

Method: 提出Momentum Tightness and Contrast框架，通过贝叶斯分析对齐新类先验与旧类统计，结合大规模对比学习、动量自监督和虚拟类别来增强特征紧密度和多样性。

Result: 在三个FSCIL基准测试上取得最先进性能，特别是在细粒度任务CUB-200上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少估计偏差，提高增量学习的鲁棒性，验证了通过特征空间丰富表示和增强类间凝聚力的有效性。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual
challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old
class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and
class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and
overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias
due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from
sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the
new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces
variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale
contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further
enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes,
we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum
Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with
rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three
FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the
fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation
bias and improve incremental learning robustness.

### [11] [Deep Learning for Clouds and Cloud Shadow Segmentation in Methane Satellite and Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19665)
*Manuel Perez-Carrasco,Maya Nasr,Sebastien Roche,Chris Chan Miller,Zhan Zhang,Core Francisco Park,Eleanor Walker,Cecilia Garraffo,Douglas Finkbeiner,Ritesh Gautam,Steven Wofsy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究使用机器学习方法进行高分辨率遥感数据的云和云影检测，比较了传统方法（ILR、MLP）和深度学习模型（UNet、SCAN），发现深度学习模型在检测质量上显著优于传统方法，其中SCAN在MethaneSAT数据上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效检测云和云影是准确反演大气甲烷等痕量气体浓度的关键前提，这对MethaneSAT等新一代高光谱遥感任务尤为重要，因为云和云影会偏置甲烷反演结果并影响排放量化。

Method: 部署和评估了传统方法（迭代逻辑回归ILR、多层感知器MLP）与先进深度学习架构（UNet、光谱通道注意力网络SCAN），用于高空间分辨率传感器的云和云影检测。

Result: 传统方法在空间一致性和边界定义方面存在困难，而深度学习模型显著提高了检测质量：UNet在保持空间结构方面表现最佳，SCAN在捕捉精细边界细节方面更优，特别是在MethaneSAT数据上SCAN超越了UNet。

Conclusion: 深入评估表明，先进的深度学习架构在提供稳健、可扩展的云和云影筛查解决方案方面具有优势，有助于增强现有和下一代高光谱任务的甲烷排放量化能力。

Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for
accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace
gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent
for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this
study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow
detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments.
Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened
out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the
quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques
including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel
Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods
struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the
detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially
improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure,
while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses
UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral
attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various
disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and
effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust,
scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing
methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation
hyperspectral missions. Our data and code is publicly available at

### [12] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Vision Models: Addressing Feature Map Anomalies Through Novel Optimization Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19687)
*Sumit Mamtani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种轻量级优化技术（STA和ANF）来改善Vision Transformers的特征图质量，解决结构化噪声问题，提升下游任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其特征图中存在的结构化噪声会阻碍分割、深度估计等下游应用的效果。

Method: 提出了两种架构无关的优化方法：1）结构化令牌增强（STA）- 在令牌化过程中通过空间扰动增强令牌多样性；2）自适应噪声过滤（ANF）- 在Transformer层之间应用可学习的在线去噪。

Result: 在ImageNet、Ade20k和NYUv2等标准基准测试中，实验结果显示视觉质量和任务性能均有持续提升。

Conclusion: 该方法具有实际有效性，能够显著改善ViTs的特征图质量，为下游应用提供更好的基础。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance across a
wide range of computer vision tasks. However, structured noise artifacts in
their feature maps hinder downstream applications such as segmentation and
depth estimation. We propose two novel and lightweight optimisation techniques-
Structured Token Augmentation (STA) and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF)- to
improve interpretability and mitigate these artefacts. STA enhances token
diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenisation, while ANF applies
learnable inline denoising between transformer layers. These methods are
architecture-agnostic and evaluated across standard benchmarks, including
ImageNet, Ade20k, and NYUv2. Experimental results show consistent improvements
in visual quality and task performance, highlighting the practical
effectiveness of our approach.

### [13] [From Prompt to Progression: Taming Video Diffusion Models for Seamless Attribute Transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19690)
*Ling Lo,Kelvin C. K. Chan,Wen-Huang Cheng,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过引入逐帧引导的方法来扩展现有模型，实现平滑且一致的属性过渡，并创建了CAT-Bench基准来评估模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理复杂时间变化时存在困难，特别是在生成具有渐进属性过渡的视频时，常见的提示插值方法往往无法处理渐进属性过渡，导致不一致性更加明显。

Method: 在去噪过程中引入逐帧引导，为每个噪声潜在空间构建数据特定的过渡方向，逐帧指导从初始属性到最终属性的渐进转变，同时保留视频的运动动态。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在现有基准上表现优越，实现了视觉保真度、与文本提示的对齐以及无缝的属性过渡。

Conclusion: 提出的方法简单有效，能够显著改善视频生成中的属性过渡质量，并通过CAT-Bench基准和相应指标为相关研究提供了评估标准。

Abstract: Existing models often struggle with complex temporal changes, particularly
when generating videos with gradual attribute transitions. The most common
prompt interpolation approach for motion transitions often fails to handle
gradual attribute transitions, where inconsistencies tend to become more
pronounced. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to extend
existing models for smooth and consistent attribute transitions, through
introducing frame-wise guidance during the denoising process. Our approach
constructs a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent,
guiding the gradual shift from initial to final attributes frame by frame while
preserving the motion dynamics of the video. Moreover, we present the
Controlled-Attribute-Transition Benchmark (CAT-Bench), which integrates both
attribute and motion dynamics, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of
different models. We further propose two metrics to assess the accuracy and
smoothness of attribute transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach performs favorably against existing baselines, achieving visual
fidelity, maintaining alignment with text prompts, and delivering seamless
attribute transitions. Code and CATBench are released:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于解剖约束的Transformer模型，用于心脏淀粉样变性的分类，通过将模型限制在心肌区域来提高分类性能并确保临床相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经网络方法虽然能处理整个超声心动图视频，但无法保证分类基于与心脏淀粉样变性相关的临床特征。作者希望开发一种能明确关注解剖区域的方法。

Method: 提出解剖约束的Transformer模型，将心肌区域嵌入为一组变形点和对应的图像块作为输入标记。同时将这种约束应用于自监督学习的掩码自编码器预训练中。

Result: 与全视频Transformer相比，该方法在心脏淀粉样变性分类任务上获得了更高的性能，并能可视化Transformer在变形心肌上的注意力分数。

Conclusion: 通过将Transformer和预训练任务约束在心肌区域，不仅提高了分类性能，还提供了分类仅关注超声心动图解剖区域的明确保证。

Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a rare cardiomyopathy, with typical abnormalities
in clinical measurements from echocardiograms such as reduced global
longitudinal strain of the myocardium. An alternative approach for detecting CA
is via neural networks, using video classification models such as convolutional
neural networks. These models process entire video clips, but provide no
assurance that classification is based on clinically relevant features known to
be associated with CA. An alternative paradigm for disease classification is to
apply models to quantitative features such as strain, ensuring that the
classification relates to clinically relevant features. Drawing inspiration
from this approach, we explicitly constrain a transformer model to the
anatomical region where many known CA abnormalities occur -- the myocardium,
which we embed as a set of deforming points and corresponding sampled image
patches into input tokens. We show that our anatomical constraint can also be
applied to the popular self-supervised learning masked autoencoder
pre-training, where we propose to mask and reconstruct only anatomical patches.
We show that by constraining both the transformer and pre-training task to the
myocardium where CA imaging features are localized, we achieve increased
performance on a CA classification task compared to full video transformers.
Our model provides an explicit guarantee that the classification is focused on
only anatomical regions of the echo, and enables us to visualize transformer
attention scores over the deforming myocardium.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于强化学习的方法，用于选择最优的心电图视频剪辑子集，以提高疾病分类性能并减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么使用单一剪辑忽略互补信息，要么使用所有剪辑计算成本过高。需要一种智能选择子集的方法来平衡性能与效率。

Method: 使用强化学习训练智能体，动态决定是否继续处理视图特定剪辑以减少分类不确定性，或停止处理当分类置信度足够高。同时提出可学习的基于注意力的聚合方法融合多剪辑信息。

Result: 在检测心脏淀粉样变性的任务中，仅使用30%的剪辑就获得了0.91的AUC，超过了使用所有剪辑和其他基准方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著减少计算资源的同时，提高了疾病分类的准确性和效率，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Guidelines for transthoracic echocardiographic examination recommend the
acquisition of multiple video clips from different views of the heart,
resulting in a large number of clips. Typically, automated methods, for
instance disease classifiers, either use one clip or average predictions from
all clips. Relying on one clip ignores complementary information available from
other clips, while using all clips is computationally expensive and may be
prohibitive for clinical adoption.
  To select the optimal subset of clips that maximize performance for a
specific task (image-based disease classification), we propose a method
optimized through reinforcement learning. In our method, an agent learns to
either keep processing view-specific clips to reduce the disease classification
uncertainty, or stop processing if the achieved classification confidence is
sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a learnable attention-based aggregation
method as a flexible way of fusing information from multiple clips. The
proposed method obtains an AUC of 0.91 on the task of detecting cardiac
amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding the performance achieved
from using all clips and from other benchmarks.

Abstract: The rise of In-Context Learning (ICL) for universal medical image
segmentation has introduced an unprecedented demand for large-scale, diverse
datasets for training, exacerbating the long-standing problem of data scarcity.
While data synthesis offers a promising solution, existing methods often fail
to simultaneously achieve both high data diversity and a domain distribution
suitable for medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{SynthICL}, a
novel data synthesis framework built upon domain randomization. SynthICL
ensures realism by leveraging anatomical priors from real-world datasets,
generates diverse anatomical structures to cover a broad data distribution, and
explicitly models inter-subject variations to create data cohorts suitable for
ICL. Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets validate our framework's
effectiveness, showing that models trained with our data achieve performance
gains of up to 63\% in average Dice and substantially enhanced generalization
to unseen anatomical domains. Our work helps mitigate the data bottleneck for
ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models. Our code and the
generated dataset are publicly available at

Motivation: 为机器人和XR应用提供准确高效的密集度量深度估计，解决资源受限环境下的实际部署需求

Method: 利用多视图信息迭代优化逐像素尺度，框架高度模块化，兼容多种现有深度估计主干网络

Result: 在TartanAir和VOID数据集上表现优异，在AR Table数据集上展示零样本泛化能力，即使每张图像只有10-20个稀疏深度点也能保持鲁棒性

Conclusion: VIMD框架在精度、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面表现突出，是资源受限环境下的实用解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力

Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual
perception in robotics and XR. In this paper, we develop a monocular
visual-inertial motion and depth (VIMD) learning framework to estimate dense
metric depth by leveraging accurate and efficient MSCKF-based monocular
visual-inertial motion tracking. At the core the proposed VIMD is to exploit
multi-view information to iteratively refine per-pixel scale, instead of
globally fitting an invariant affine model as in the prior work. The VIMD
framework is highly modular, making it compatible with a variety of existing
depth estimation backbones. We conduct extensive evaluations on the TartanAir
and VOID datasets and demonstrate its zero-shot generalization capabilities on
the AR Table dataset. Our results show that VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy
and robustness, even with extremely sparse points as few as 10-20 metric depth
points per image. This makes the proposed VIMD a practical solution for
deployment in resource constrained settings, while its robust performance and
strong generalization capabilities offer significant potential across a wide
range of scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于频率域多模态交互的医学图像分割模型FMISeg，通过语言引导来提升肺部感染区域的自动分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学图像分割方法在结合临床文本报告作为语义指导时，由于病灶形态复杂多变以及视觉-语言模态间的语义鸿沟，难以有效增强视觉特征表示并消除语义无关信息，导致分割性能不理想。

Method: FMISeg是一种后期融合模型，在解码器中建立语言特征与频率域视觉特征的交互。具体包括：1）频率域特征双向交互模块（FFBI）用于增强视觉表示；2）语言引导的频率域特征交互模块（LFFI）在语言信息指导下抑制语义无关的视觉特征。

Result: 在QaTa-COV19和MosMedData+数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估上都优于现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FMISeg通过频率域多模态交互机制有效解决了医学图像分割中的语义鸿沟问题，显著提升了语言引导下的分割性能。

Abstract: Automatically segmenting infected areas in radiological images is essential
for diagnosing pulmonary infectious diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated
that the accuracy of the medical image segmentation can be improved by
incorporating clinical text reports as semantic guidance. However, the complex
morphological changes of lesions and the inherent semantic gap between
vision-language modalities prevent existing methods from effectively enhancing
the representation of visual features and eliminating semantically irrelevant
information, ultimately resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. To
address these problems, we propose a Frequency-domain Multi-modal Interaction
model (FMISeg) for language-guided medical image segmentation. FMISeg is a late
fusion model that establishes interaction between linguistic features and
frequency-domain visual features in the decoder. Specifically, to enhance the
visual representation, our method introduces a Frequency-domain Feature
Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) module to effectively fuse frequency-domain
features. Furthermore, a Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction
(LFFI) module is incorporated within the decoder to suppress semantically
irrelevant visual features under the guidance of linguistic information.
Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ demonstrated that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验结果验证了该方法的有效性，实现了10分钟内的快速反射表面重建

Conclusion: PolGS模型通过偏振约束显著提升了3D高斯泼溅方法在复杂反射表面重建方面的性能

Abstract: Efficient shape reconstruction for surfaces with complex reflectance
properties is crucial for real-time virtual reality. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS)-based methods offer fast novel view rendering by leveraging
their explicit surface representation, their reconstruction quality lags behind
that of implicit neural representations, particularly in the case of recovering
surfaces with complex reflective reflectance. To address these problems, we
propose PolGS, a Polarimetric Gaussian Splatting model allowing fast reflective
surface reconstruction in 10 minutes. By integrating polarimetric constraints
into the 3DGS framework, PolGS effectively separates specular and diffuse
components, enhancing reconstruction quality for challenging reflective
materials. Experimental results on the synthetic and real-world dataset
validate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的图像编辑模型会盲目遵循所有用户指令，即使指令不可行或矛盾，导致输出无意义。需要一种能够识别并忽略不可执行指令的方法。

Method: 提出CAMILA方法，使用上下文感知掩码技术验证指令与图像的上下文一致性，只对相关区域应用有效编辑，忽略不可执行指令。构建了包含不可行请求的单指令和多指令编辑数据集进行评估。

Result: CAMILA在性能上优于现有最先进模型，实现了更高的语义对齐，在处理复杂指令挑战的同时保持了图像完整性。

Conclusion: CAMILA通过上下文验证机制有效解决了图像编辑中不可行指令的问题，提高了编辑的准确性和语义一致性。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has been allowing users to transform and synthesize
images through natural language instructions, offering considerable
flexibility. However, most existing image editing models naively attempt to
follow all user instructions, even if those instructions are inherently
infeasible or contradictory, often resulting in nonsensical output. To address
these challenges, we propose a context-aware method for image editing named as
CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment).
CAMILA is designed to validate the contextual coherence between instructions
and the image, ensuring that only relevant edits are applied to the designated
regions while ignoring non-executable instructions. For comprehensive
evaluation of this new method, we constructed datasets for both single- and
multi-instruction image editing, incorporating the presence of infeasible
requests. Our method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment
than state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling
complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.

Method: 使用对称特征提取编码器、视觉傅里叶提示和模态融合提示生成器。首先提取RGB和热红外模态特征，然后将空间域视觉提示与FFT获得的频域提示结合，最后通过模态融合生成双向交互提示

Result: 在三个流行的RGB-T跟踪基准测试上进行的广泛实验表明，该方法表现出卓越的性能

Conclusion: 提出的VFPTrack方法通过有效利用频域信息，显著提升了RGB-T跟踪的性能，证明了频域提示在多模态特征学习中的重要性

Abstract: Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking
as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based
RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as
prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal
performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in
prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier
Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature
extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality
Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts
through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature
extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.
Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency
domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and
understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally,
unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we
use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality
prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to
fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive
experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our
method demonstrates outstanding performance.

Method: 提出RD³方法，通过系统调查不同后评估设置的影响，识别改进蒸馏数据集有效性的通用策略，建立标准化评估协议。

Conclusion: RD³为未来数据集蒸馏研究提供了公平可复现比较的基础，通过标准化基准和严谨评估协议推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to generate compact synthetic datasets that enable
models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to those trained on
full real datasets, while substantially reducing storage and computational
costs. Early bi-level optimization methods (e.g., MTT) have shown promising
results on small-scale datasets, but their scalability is limited by high
computational overhead. To address this limitation, recent decoupled dataset
distillation methods (e.g., SRe$^2$L) separate the teacher model pre-training
from the synthetic data generation process. These methods also introduce random
data augmentation and epoch-wise soft labels during the post-evaluation phase
to improve performance and generalization. However, existing decoupled
distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which
hinders progress in the field. In this work, we propose Rectified Decoupled
Dataset Distillation (RD$^3$), and systematically investigate how different
post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy. We further examine whether the
reported performance differences across existing methods reflect true
methodological advances or stem from discrepancies in evaluation procedures.
Our analysis reveals that much of the performance variation can be attributed
to inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in the intrinsic quality of
the synthetic data. In addition, we identify general strategies that improve
the effectiveness of distilled datasets across settings. By establishing a
standardized benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol, RD$^3$ provides a
foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation
research.

Result: 在多个临床分割基准测试中，仅使用5%-20%标注数据即可达到或超过全监督模型性能

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一种可扩展的端到端学习策略，在不牺牲准确性的前提下显著降低医学图像分割的标注需求

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical
image segmentation, offering competitive performance while substantially
reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. When combined with active
learning (AL), these strategies further minimize annotation burden by
selectively incorporating the most informative samples. However, conventional
SSL_AL hybrid approaches often rely on iterative and loop-based retraining
cycles after each annotation round, incurring significant computational
overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications. In this study, we
present a novel, annotation-efficient, and self-adaptive deep segmentation
framework that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering
(FilterMatch), an AL-inspired mechanism, within the single-pass nnU-Net
training segmentation framework (nnFilterMatch). By selectively excluding
high-confidence pseudo-labels during training, our method circumvents the need
for retraining loops while preserving the benefits of uncertainty-guided
learning. We validate the proposed framework across multiple clinical
segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable
to or exceeding fully supervised models, even with only 5\%--20\% labeled data.
This work introduces a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing
annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖情感标签或隐式的AU条件，缺乏物理基础的逐帧表情控制能力

Method: 第一阶段使用变分运动生成器从音频和AU强度预测时间连贯的2D面部关键点序列；第二阶段使用基于扩散的合成器根据关键点和参考图像生成逼真视频

Result: 在MEAD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多个指标上优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: 显式的AU到关键点建模方法在表达性说话头生成中具有显著效果

Abstract: We propose a two-stage framework for audio-driven talking head generation
with fine-grained expression control via facial Action Units (AUs). Unlike
prior methods relying on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning, our model
explicitly maps AUs to 2D facial landmarks, enabling physically grounded,
per-frame expression control. In the first stage, a variational motion
generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU
intensities. In the second stage, a diffusion-based synthesizer generates
realistic, lip-synced videos conditioned on these landmarks and a reference
image. This separation of motion and appearance improves expression accuracy,
temporal stability, and visual realism. Experiments on the MEAD dataset show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics,
demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit AU-to-landmark modeling for
expressive talking head generation.

TL;DR: ExpFace是一种新的指数角度边缘损失函数，通过引入角度指数项作为边缘，在角度空间中中心区域施加更大惩罚、边缘区域施加较小惩罚，从而强调干净样本并抑制噪声样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于边缘的softmax损失（如SphereFace、CosFace、ArcFace）虽然增强了类内紧凑性和类间可分离性，但忽略了噪声样本的影响。通过观察角度空间中的样本分布，发现干净样本主要聚集在中心区域，而噪声样本倾向于向边缘区域偏移。

Method: 提出指数角度边缘损失（ExpFace），在角度空间中引入指数项作为边缘，使得在中心区域施加更大惩罚，在边缘区域施加较小惩罚。通过统一分析ExpFace和经典边缘softmax损失的边缘嵌入形式、相似度曲线和梯度曲线来验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明ExpFace实现了最先进的性能，避免了SphereFace的训练不稳定性和ArcFace的非单调性问题，其相似度曲线与角度空间中的决策边界惩罚方式一致。

Conclusion: ExpFace通过角度指数边缘设计有效处理噪声样本问题，在面部识别任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了新的思路和开源代码。

Abstract: Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power
to ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances.
Margin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have
been widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the
distribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples
predominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift
toward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the
Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular
exponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the
center region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular
space, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We
present a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses
in terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves,
showing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and
the non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that
applies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular
space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art
performance. To facilitate future research, we have released the source code

Conclusion: Logics-Parsing模型通过强化学习增强的LVLM方法，有效解决了复杂文档解析的挑战，为文档分析领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language models (LVLM) have spurred
significant progress in document parsing task. Compared to traditional
pipeline-based methods, end-to-end paradigms have shown their excellence in
converting PDF images into structured outputs through integrated Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), table recognition, mathematical formula
recognition and so on. However, the absence of explicit analytical stages for
document layouts and reading orders limits the LVLM's capability in handling
complex document types such as multi-column newspapers or posters. To address
this limitation, we propose in this report Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end
LVLM-based model augmented with reinforcement learning. Our model incorporates
meticulously designed reward mechanisms to optimize complex layout analysis and
reading order inference. In addition, we expand the model's versatility by
incorporating diverse data types such as chemical formulas and handwritten
Chinese characters into supervised fine-tuning. Finally, to enable rigorous
evaluation of our approach, we introduce LogicsParsingBench, a curated set of
1,078 page-level PDF images spanning nine major categories and over twenty
sub-categories, which will be released later. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on LogicsParsingBench have validated the efficacy and
State-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our proposed model across diverse

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究发现Dice相似系数(DSC)等重叠度指标本身存在性别偏差，因为较小的器官（如女性器官）在相同误差下DSC下降更明显，这可能导致对分割模型性能的不公平评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注模型或数据集的性别差异，但尚未探讨DSC指标本身可能引入的性别偏差。由于器官大小存在性别差异，相同大小的分割误差在不同性别的器官上可能产生不同的DSC评分。

Method: 在50名参与者的手动MRI标注上应用相同大小的合成误差，确保性别间的可比性。通过模拟最小误差（如1毫米边界偏移）来量化DSC的性别差异。

Result: 即使最小误差也会产生系统性DSC性别差异：小结构平均差异约0.03，中等结构约0.01，只有大结构（肺和肝）受影响较小。

Conclusion: DSC指标本身存在性别偏差，使用DSC进行公平性研究时不应期望男女得分相同。识别这一因素对于医学图像分析的准确和公平评估至关重要。

Abstract: Overlap-based metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) penalize
segmentation errors more heavily in smaller structures. As organ size differs
by sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in
lower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.
While previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,
no study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.
This study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC
in an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied
equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants
to ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary
shift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,
average DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around
0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,
with sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that
fairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect
identical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A
segmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error
magnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work
raises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences
in segmentation performance. One that arises not from model behavior, but from
the metric itself. Recognizing this factor is essential for more accurate and
fair evaluations in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on
resource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision,
as its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent
surveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a
mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally
face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts,
hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a
light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR
reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the
Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the
YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then
employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress
ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce
Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced
Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at
multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main
version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in
computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between
performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared
to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and
increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge
device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and
ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and
practicality across various dynamic scenarios.

### [29] [BiTAA: A Bi-Task Adversarial Attack for Object Detection and Depth Estimation via 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19793)
*Yixun Zhang,Feng Zhou,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiTAA是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的双任务对抗攻击方法，能够同时降低目标检测性能并偏置单目深度估计，揭示了自动驾驶多任务感知中的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D/3D攻击方法多为任务孤岛，缺乏可控深度偏置机制，且没有标准化协议来量化跨任务迁移，导致检测与深度任务间的交互关系未被充分探索。

Method: 基于3D高斯泼溅构建双模型攻击框架，支持全图像和补丁设置，兼容常见检测器和深度估计器；设计了复合损失函数，将检测抑制与可控的带符号对数深度偏置耦合，在感兴趣区域内实现可控的近远误感知。

Result: 实验显示该方法能实现一致的跨任务性能下降，并揭示了从检测到深度和从深度到检测的明显不对称迁移特性。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了多任务相机感知的实际风险，并推动了自动驾驶场景中跨任务感知防御机制的发展。

Abstract: Camera-based perception is critical to autonomous driving yet remains
vulnerable to task-specific adversarial manipulations in object detection and
monocular depth estimation. Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task
silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no
standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction
between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task
adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single
perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing
monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that
supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common
detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation
(EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that
couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth
bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far
misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also
propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and
real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear
asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results
highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate
cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.

TL;DR: StrCGAN是一种用于增强低分辨率天体摄影图像的生成模型，通过3D卷积层、多光谱融合和天体物理正则化模块来重建高质量的天体图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型望远镜观测图像分辨率低、质量差的问题，传统CycleGAN模型在2D映射中会扭曲恒星和星系的形态。

Method: 扩展CycleGAN框架，引入3D卷积层捕获体积空间相关性，多光谱融合对齐光学和近红外域，天体物理正则化模块保持恒星形态。

Result: StrCGAN生成的图像不仅视觉上更清晰，而且在物理上更一致，在天体物理图像增强任务中优于标准GAN模型。

Conclusion: StrCGAN通过创新的3D卷积、多光谱融合和物理正则化方法，成功实现了高质量天体图像的重建，为低分辨率天体摄影提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce StrCGAN (Stellar Cyclic GAN), a generative model designed to
enhance low-resolution astrophotography images. Our goal is to reconstruct
high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task
that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of
small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional
models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but
are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and
galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with
three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial
correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR)
domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar
morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning
optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain
consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to
generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically
consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical
image enhancement.

Motivation: 现有模型集成方法在持续学习中存在任务级和层级的知识冲突问题，导致新旧任务的学习性能都受到影响。

Method: 使用元学习训练混合系数生成器，为每个层级单独生成适当的混合系数进行模型集成，自适应融合不同任务的知识。

Result: 在多个持续学习数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效缓解灾难性遗忘，并达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: meta-weight-ensembler能够灵活结合现有持续学习方法，提升其缓解灾难性遗忘的能力，实现新旧任务的高效学习。

Abstract: Model ensemble is an effective strategy in continual learning, which
alleviates catastrophic forgetting by interpolating model parameters, achieving
knowledge fusion learned from different tasks. However, existing model ensemble
methods usually encounter the knowledge conflict issue at task and layer
levels, causing compromised learning performance in both old and new tasks. To
solve this issue, we propose meta-weight-ensembler that adaptively fuses
knowledge of different tasks for continual learning. Concretely, we employ a
mixing coefficient generator trained via meta-learning to generate appropriate
mixing coefficients for model ensemble to address the task-level knowledge
conflict. The mixing coefficient is individually generated for each layer to
address the layer-level knowledge conflict. In this way, we learn the prior
knowledge about adaptively accumulating knowledge of different tasks in a fused
model, achieving efficient learning in both old and new tasks.
Meta-weight-ensembler can be flexibly combined with existing continual learning
methods to boost their ability of alleviating catastrophic forgetting.
Experiments on multiple continual learning datasets show that
meta-weight-ensembler effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated images has raised serious concerns
about misinformation and privacy violations, highlighting the urgent need for
accurate and interpretable detection methods. While existing approaches have
made progress, most rely on binary classification without explanations or
depend heavily on supervised fine-tuning, resulting in limited generalization.
In this paper, we propose ThinkFake, a novel reasoning-based and generalizable
framework for AI-generated image detection. Our method leverages a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) equipped with a forgery reasoning prompt and is
trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning
with carefully designed reward functions. This design enables the model to
perform step-by-step reasoning and produce interpretable, structured outputs.
We further introduce a structured detection pipeline to enhance reasoning
quality and adaptability. Extensive experiments show that ThinkFake outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the GenImage benchmark and demonstrates strong
zero-shot generalization on the challenging LOKI benchmark. These results
validate our framework's effectiveness and robustness. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly
complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents
in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains
challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human
preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized
Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study
personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to
objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries
such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality
episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode
includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations
between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific
semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation
in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes.
Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human
performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving,
reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards
real-world assistive robot.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型的对抗性攻击方法FreezeVLA，能够通过对抗图像使模型"冻结"并忽略后续指令，揭示了VLA模型的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在机器人技术中取得了快速进展，但其对抗攻击的安全性和鲁棒性尚未得到充分探索。研究发现VLA模型存在关键漏洞，对抗图像可能导致模型"冻结"，在关键干预时引发不行动。

Method: 提出FreezeVLA攻击框架，通过min-max双层优化生成和评估动作冻结攻击。在三个最先进的VLA模型和四个机器人基准测试上进行实验。

Result: FreezeVLA平均攻击成功率达到76.2%，显著优于现有方法。生成的对抗图像具有强迁移性，单个图像能在不同语言提示下可靠诱导瘫痪。

Conclusion: 研究结果暴露了VLA模型的关键安全风险，强调了开发鲁棒防御机制的紧迫性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are driving rapid progress in robotics by
enabling agents to interpret multimodal inputs and execute complex,
long-horizon tasks. However, their safety and robustness against adversarial
attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a
critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA
models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat
effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions,
potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically
study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that
generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level
optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic
benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%,
significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images
generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image
reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings
expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for
robust defense mechanisms.

Result: 在低光照和高度遮挡场景中，延迟降低79%以上，计算成本降低70%，同时保持检测精度

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了复杂场景下的检测精度和效率，实现了精度与效率的良好平衡

Abstract: Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges
in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a
lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes
an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object
detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving
an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method
first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured
scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that
dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for
edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud
collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between
invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection
results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex
scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost
by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种专门用于360度球形图像的超像素分割方法SphSPS，通过考虑3D球形采集空间的几何特性来改进分割精度和形状规则性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超像素分割方法主要针对标准2D平面图像设计，无法有效处理360度球形或全向图像的几何失真问题，需要专门的方法来适应这种图像的特殊几何结构。

Method: SphSPS方法基于球形最短路径，将像素与超像素中心之间的最短路径概念推广到球形空间，快速提取相关聚类特征，并考虑了采集空间的几何特性。

Result: 在参考的360度球形全景分割数据集和合成道路全向图像上验证，SphSPS在分割精度、噪声鲁棒性和规则性方面显著优于现有的平面和球形方法。

Conclusion: SphSPS为360度图像的超像素应用提供了一个非常有价值的工具，通过考虑球形几何特性有效改进了分割性能。

Abstract: The growing use of wide angle image capture devices and the need for fast and
accurate image analysis in computer visions have enforced the need for
dedicated under-representation approaches. Most recent decomposition methods
segment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called
superpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment
standard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without
distortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called
SphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide
360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of
the 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path
between a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering
features. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space
to compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation
accuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity
aspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space,
addressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure.
Finally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o
spherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional
images. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to
noise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based
applications on 360o images.

Motivation: 现有自监督和对比学习方法需要大规模模型和大量数据，且难以处理批次效应，限制了细胞表型预测在药物发现中的应用。

Method: CWA-MSN采用跨孔对齐策略，将相同扰动下不同孔的细胞嵌入对齐，结合掩码孪生架构，实现语义一致性并保持数据参数效率。

Result: 在基因-基因关系检索基准测试中，CWA-MSN比OpenPhenom和CellCLIP分别提升29%和9%，同时使用更少数据（0.2M vs 2.2M）和更小模型（22M vs 1.48B参数）。

Conclusion: CWA-MSN是一种简单有效的细胞图像表示学习方法，能在有限数据和参数预算下实现高效表型建模。

Abstract: Computational models that predict cellular phenotypic responses to chemical
and genetic perturbations can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing
therapeutic hypotheses and reducing costly wet-lab iteration. However,
extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting
representations remains challenging. Conventional self-supervised and
contrastive learning approaches often require a large-scale model and/or a huge
amount of carefully curated data, still struggling with batch effects. We
present Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN), a novel
representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to
the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency
despite batch effects. Integrated into a masked siamese architecture, this
alignment yields features that capture fine-grained morphology while remaining
data- and parameter-efficient. For instance, in a gene-gene relationship
retrieval benchmark, CWA-MSN outperforms the state-of-the-art publicly
available self-supervised (OpenPhenom) and contrastive learning (CellCLIP)
methods, improving the benchmark scores by +29\% and +9\%, respectively, while
training on substantially fewer data (e.g., 0.2M images for CWA-MSN vs. 2.2M
images for OpenPhenom) or smaller model size (e.g., 22M parameters for CWA-MSN
vs. 1.48B parameters for CellCLIP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation,
enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter
budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空和地面图像的集成是复杂场景3D建模的有前景方案，但由于视角变化大导致透视失真严重，难以找到可靠的对应关系，这限制了该方案的应用。

Method: 1) 仅使用航空图像通过增量式SfM重建稀疏模型；2) 采用3D高斯泼溅技术进行场景渲染；3) 设计渲染视点确定算法生成高质量中间图像；4) 通过中间图像进行可靠的航空-地面图像特征匹配。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案通过中间视图生成有效缓解了航空和地面图像间的视角差异问题，为复杂场景的3D建模提供了可靠的特征匹配方法。

Abstract: The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in
3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding
reliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature
matching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate
intermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive
viewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are
reconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to
their large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for
scene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For
accurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed
by using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate
high-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and
ground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature
matching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground
images, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences
through intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the
validation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature
matching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used
methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can
provide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious
increase in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide
enough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based
scene rendering.

Motivation: 现有的3DGS修复方法依赖2D视角的扩散或GAN模型来预测缺失区域的外观或深度线索，但这种方法需要维护空间时间一致性且耗时。本文旨在开发直接在3DGS模态上进行替代性修复的方法。

Method: 构建特征嵌入的3DGS场景，采用多尺度局部上下文抽象方法，提出3D空间结构搜索找到候选补丁，最后通过简单有效的替换融合优化实现视觉和谐。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在驾驶场景中实现了最先进的性能，质量和互操作性均优于基线方法。在一般场景中的额外实验也验证了该3D修复策略的适用性。

Conclusion: GS-RoadPatching通过利用驾驶场景中高度重复模式在3DGS特征空间中的多模态相似性，实现了高效且有效的3D场景修复，摆脱了对2D跨模态一致性的依赖。

Abstract: This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene
completion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are
represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting
methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based
diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing
regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing
directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring
spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for
time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly
repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities
within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for
structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting.
Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch
measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and,
subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in
3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective
substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct
extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and
the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability.
Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of
the proposed 3D inpainting strategy. The project page and code are available

Result: 该方法在无训练语义分割任务中超越了先前方法，并能有效监测数据集分布偏移。证明了检查神经网络中个体计算路径可以揭示可解释单元。

Conclusion: 通过分解神经元贡献到计算路径的方法成功揭示了神经网络中的可解释单元，这些单元可以有效地应用于下游任务，为神经网络解释性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by
decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation
paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and
the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that
these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in
CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret
each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that
only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to
the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic,
represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these
observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free
semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second,
we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual
computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that
such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的投诉挖掘任务——基于视频的投诉描述（CoD-V），旨在帮助用户通过视频表达产品缺陷投诉，并介绍了ComVID数据集和新的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本投诉挖掘方法存在局限性，用户难以用文字清晰表达问题，但可以轻松上传展示产品缺陷的视频。需要开发能够理解视频内容并生成准确投诉描述的系统。

Method: 构建了包含1,175个投诉视频的ComVID数据集，提出投诉保留（CR）评估指标，并开发了基于多模态检索增强生成（RAG）的VideoLLaMA2-7b模型，能够考虑用户情绪状态生成投诉描述。

Result: 对多个视频语言模型进行了全面评估，使用了METEOR、困惑度和Coleman-Liau可读性分数等指标。研究为通过视频表达投诉的新研究方向奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决用户通过视频表达投诉的需求提供了新平台，数据集和资源已公开可用，推动了视频投诉挖掘领域的发展。

Abstract: While there exists a lot of work on explainable complaint mining,
articulating user concerns through text or video remains a significant
challenge, often leaving issues unresolved. Users frequently struggle to
express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting
product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a
5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper
formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users'
need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from
Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the
defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint
dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions,
also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we
present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the
proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description
tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to
generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct
a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks
(pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation
metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score,
among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to
provide a platform for users to express complaints through video. Dataset and
resources are available at: https://github.com/sarmistha-D/CoD-V.

*Phyo Thet Yee,Dimitrios Kollias,Sudeepta Mishra,Abhinav Dhall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynchroRaMa是一个新颖的音频驱动说话人脸生成框架，通过多模态情感嵌入和动态场景描述，解决了现有方法在情感表达和动态变化方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖单一模态（音频或图像）进行情感嵌入，且通常基于单张参考图像，无法有效捕捉细微的情感线索和动态的动作属性变化。

Method: 结合文本情感分析和音频情感识别进行多模态情感嵌入；使用音频到运动模块确保头部运动和唇部同步；引入LLM生成的场景描述来捕捉动态动作和语义属性。

Result: 在基准数据集上的定量和定性实验表明，SynchroRaMa在图像质量、表情保持和运动真实性方面优于现有技术；用户研究证实其在自然度、运动多样性和视频流畅度方面获得更高主观评分。

Conclusion: SynchroRaMa通过多模态情感嵌入和动态场景描述，显著提升了说话人脸生成的情感表达真实性和视觉一致性，为人类-虚拟化身交互提供了更自然的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest,
particularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar
interaction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single
modality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability
to capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a
single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic
changes in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we
introduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion
embedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and
audio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal
features), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more
authentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion
and accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M)
module that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally,
SynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model
(LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and
high-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and
textual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa
outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality,
expression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that
SynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in
overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness. Our project page

TL;DR: 提出OmniScene框架，通过视觉语言模型和多模态融合实现人类化的4D场景理解，在自动驾驶中超越传统深度重建方法，在多个任务上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统缺乏真正的人类化场景理解能力，主要依赖基于深度的3D重建而非语义理解，需要开发更接近人类视觉的感知架构

Method: 提出OmniScene框架：1）OmniVLM视觉语言模型整合多视角和时间感知；2）师生架构和知识蒸馏嵌入文本表示到3D特征；3）分层融合策略自适应校准几何和语义特征权重

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上全面评估，相比10多个SOTA模型，在感知、预测、规划和视觉问答等任务上均取得最优结果

Conclusion: OmniScene通过人类化注意力语义和多模态协同融合，实现了更接近人类驾驶行为的感知-理解-行动架构，为自动驾驶提供了新的场景理解范式

Abstract: Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an
egocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability
to translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability,
however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where
mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather
than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene
Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates
multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then,
harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation,
we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic
supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like
attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with
human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like
perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a
Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality
contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates
the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple
abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from
visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more
nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate
OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over
ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently
achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception,
prediction, planning, and visual question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注透视投影视频生成中的相机控制，而几何一致的全景视频生成仍然具有挑战性，主要由于全景姿态表示和球面投影的固有复杂性。

Method: 提出全景Plücker嵌入通过球面坐标变换编码相机外参，并引入球面极线模块通过沿极线的自适应注意力掩码实现细粒度跨视图特征聚合。

Conclusion: CamPVG框架成功解决了全景视频生成中的几何一致性问题，为相机控制的全景视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, camera-controlled video generation has seen rapid development,
offering more precise control over video generation. However, existing methods
predominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video
generation, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains
challenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in
panoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue,
we propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video
generation guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding
for panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical
projection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl\"ucker embedding that
encodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate
transformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to
equirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar
module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking
along epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature
aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated
panoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far
surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

Conclusion: SDE-DET为沙田柚检测提供了一种可靠方法，为自动收获机器人的进一步发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pomelo detection is an essential process for their localization, automated
robotic harvesting, and maturity analysis. However, detecting Shatian pomelo in
complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including
multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object
detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset
STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection.
SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional
information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the
presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its
ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple
Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to
reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations,
thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment,
we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models
in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of
0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5,
mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET
provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation
for the further development of automatic harvest robots.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的代理目标攻击（PTA）方法，解决了多模态预训练模型中现有目标对抗攻击在泛化性和不可检测性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态预训练模型（如ImageBind）在跨模态对齐任务中的目标对抗攻击存在两个主要问题：1）生成的对抗样本对部分已知或语义相似目标的泛化能力有限；2）容易被简单的异常检测方法检测到。

Method: 提出了代理目标攻击（PTA）方法，利用多个源模态和目标模态代理来优化目标对抗样本，确保其在保持对防御措施规避的同时与多个潜在目标对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，PTA方法能够在各种相关目标上实现高成功率，并且对多种异常检测方法保持不可检测性。

Conclusion: PTA方法有效解决了多模态预训练模型中目标对抗攻击的泛化性和不可检测性问题，为多模态模型的安全性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data
modalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across
downstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security
concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained
models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and
undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs)
exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar
targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can
be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited
undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method
called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and
target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to
defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide
theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and
undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the
specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results
demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related
targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于内存库的异常检测方法在大型医学数据集上计算负担过重，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 使用DINOv2预训练模型提取特征嵌入，采用Dirichlet过程混合模型建模正常样本分布，通过比较嵌入与混合中心相似度进行异常检测

Result: 该方法在医学图像异常检测基准上达到竞争力性能，同时推理时间至少减少一半，归一化DINOv2特征与解剖结构更匹配

Conclusion: DINOv2特征结合DPMM是医学图像异常检测的有效方法，即使DINOv2在自然图像上训练，也能很好适应医学领域

Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for
unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a
memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection
which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large
medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially.
Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings
with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model
that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at
hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the
component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a
coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM
embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very
competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can
do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis
further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned
with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of
anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection. The code is

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了标注工作量，在有限预算下实现了高效的表格检测模型训练。

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning,
particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data.
Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL
approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances
suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling
efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of
representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our
method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using
state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our
results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms
random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while
maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method
achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

Conclusion: RITA框架通过序列预测方式更好地匹配图像篡改的本质特征，为解决图像篡改定位任务提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: Image manipulations often entail a complex manipulation process, comprising a
series of editing operations to create a deceptive image, exhibiting
sequentiality and hierarchical characteristics. However, existing IML methods
remain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in
a one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps.
This one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into
a single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a
fundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.
  To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation
localization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA
framework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered
manner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby
explicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among
editing operations.
  To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data
and construct a new benchmark HSIM. We further propose the HSS metric to assess
sequential order and hierarchical alignment. Extensive experiments show RITA
achieves SOTA on traditional benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for the
novel hierarchical localization task, validating its potential as a general and
effective paradigm. The code and dataset will be publicly available.

Method: 提出原型表示方法：1）病理报告诊断原型，使用自注意力提取相关文本；2）组织学原型，紧凑表示WSI关键形态模式；3）生物通路原型，编码转录组表达。然后使用Transformer模型处理这些原型标记并进行跨模态交互。

Conclusion: 病理报告的加入确实能提升预后预测性能，提出的原型表示方法有效解决了多模态异质性问题，三模态融合在癌症生存预测中表现出优越性。

Abstract: Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily
focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with
genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We
hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic
performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows,
offer readily available complementary information by summarizing
histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical
context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their
heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several
billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of
varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we
propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which
are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival
prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities).
Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports,
leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and
standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly
represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway
prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular
functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting
prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal
interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The
proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against
clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.

Abstract: Biometric-based authentication systems are getting broadly adopted in many
areas. However, these systems do not allow participating users to influence the
way their data is used. Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused
without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication
method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative
adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating
images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes).
Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on
the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the
method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.

Motivation: 安全图形验证码作为关键防伪工具，其可靠性受到智能手机图像采集质量差的严重影响。不受控制的用户采集高熵模式会导致高误拒率，形成显著的'可靠性差距'。

Method: 与传统感知图像质量评估不同，本文引入了一个预测性框架来估计帧对下游验证任务的效用。提出了一个轻量级模型来预测视频帧的质量分数，确定其是否适合资源密集型的oracle模型。在包含105部智能手机的32,000+图像数据集上使用重新情境化的FNMR和ISRR指标进行验证。

Conclusion: 本文为现实世界泛化提供了关键见解：对于来自物理制造的域偏移，冻结的通用主干网络可以比完全微调更鲁棒，这为防止过度拟合源域伪影提供了有效策略。

Abstract: The reliability of secure graphic verification, a key anti-counterfeiting
tool, is undermined by poor image acquisition on smartphones. Uncontrolled user
captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates,
creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from
traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively
estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a
lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its
suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated
using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of
32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis
on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a
lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better
to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a
key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical
manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full
fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

Motivation: 当前基于编码器-解码器的可变形图像配准方法缺乏对配准有用特征的专门提取，并且在三个方向上均匀预测变形场，存在局限性。

Method: 在编码器层引入混合注意力头(MoA)动态选择最优注意力组合，在解码器层使用空间异构专家混合(SHMoE)为每个体素使用不同核大小的专家异构预测变形场。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验显示性能持续提升，腹部CT数据集的Dice分数从60.58%提升到65.58%。

Conclusion: SHMoAReg首次将专家混合机制引入可变形图像配准任务，不仅提升了性能还增强了模型可解释性。

Abstract: Encoder-Decoder architectures are widely used in deep learning-based
Deformable Image Registration (DIR), where the encoder extracts multi-scale
features and the decoder predicts deformation fields by recovering spatial
locations. However, current methods lack specialized extraction of features
(that are useful for registration) and predict deformation jointly and
homogeneously in all three directions. In this paper, we propose a novel
expert-guided DIR network with Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism applied in
both encoder and decoder, named SHMoAReg. Specifically, we incorporate Mixture
of Attention heads (MoA) into encoder layers, while Spatial Heterogeneous
Mixture of Experts (SHMoE) into the decoder layers. The MoA enhances the
specialization of feature extraction by dynamically selecting the optimal
combination of attention heads for each image token. Meanwhile, the SHMoE
predicts deformation fields heterogeneously in three directions for each voxel
using experts with varying kernel sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets show consistent improvements over various methods,
with a notable increase from 60.58% to 65.58% in Dice score for the abdominal
CT dataset. Furthermore, SHMoAReg enhances model interpretability by
differentiating experts' utilities across/within different resolution layers.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce MoE mechanism into
DIR tasks. The code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像去雾中表现出色，但存在计算负担重和推理步骤多的问题，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 探索雾霾图像在预训练扩散模型语义潜空间中的特性，将不同时间步的扩散潜表示集成到精心设计的去雾网络中。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有的图像去雾方法。

Conclusion: DiffLI²D为将扩散模型引入图像去雾提供了新视角，有效利用了预训练扩散模型的信息表示。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been investigated as powerful generative
solvers for image dehazing, owing to their remarkable capability to model the
data distribution. However, the massive computational burden imposed by the
retraining of diffusion models, coupled with the extensive sampling steps
during the inference, limit the broader application of diffusion models in
image dehazing. To address these issues, we explore the properties of hazy
images in the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, and
propose a Diffusion Latent Inspired network for Image Dehazing, dubbed
DiffLI$^2$D. Specifically, we first reveal that the semantic latent space of
pre-trained diffusion models can represent the content and haze characteristics
of hazy images, as the diffusion time-step changes. Building upon this insight,
we integrate the diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into
a delicately designed dehazing network to provide instructions for image
dehazing. Our DiffLI$^2$D avoids re-training diffusion models and iterative
sampling process by effectively utilizing the informative representations
derived from the pre-trained diffusion models, which also offers a novel
perspective for introducing diffusion models to image dehazing. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior performance to existing image dehazing methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的高光谱适配器，利用预训练的视觉基础模型有效学习高光谱数据，在自动驾驶数据集上实现了最先进的语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的高光谱语义分割方法表现不佳，因为它们依赖于为RGB输入优化的架构和学习框架。高光谱成像具有丰富的空间光谱信息，可以在复杂环境中实现鲁棒的机器人感知。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的高光谱适配器架构，包含光谱变换器和光谱感知空间先验模块来提取丰富的空间光谱特征，还引入了模态感知交互块，通过专门的提取和注入机制有效整合高光谱表示和冻结的视觉Transformer特征。

Result: 在三个基准自动驾驶数据集上的广泛评估表明，该架构在使用HSI输入时实现了最先进的语义分割性能，优于基于视觉和高光谱分割方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了高光谱语义分割的挑战，通过适配器设计有效利用了预训练视觉基础模型，为复杂环境下的机器人感知提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense
spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich
spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception,
particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying
illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI
semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on
architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work,
we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision
foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our
architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial
prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we
introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective
integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer
features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive
evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our
architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while
directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral
segmentation methods. We make the code available at

TL;DR: 为了解决科学视觉问答中文本与图像分离输入的问题，本文提出将视觉和文本内容嵌入到单一图像中的新方法，并通过合成数据集和微调多语言多模态模型，在13种语言上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学视觉问答对视觉语言模型具有挑战性，传统方法将图像和文本作为分离输入处理效果不佳。EXAMS-V虽然引入了文本嵌入图像的新范式，但即使在零样本设置下，最先进的专有模型表现仍然较差，需要任务特定的微调。

Method: 为了解决训练数据稀缺问题，作者合成了新的数据集，将现有的分离图像-文本对转换为统一的图像格式。然后在一个小型多语言多模态模型上，使用合成数据和EXAMS-V的混合数据进行微调。

Result: 在13种语言上的实验结果显示，该方法带来了显著的性能提升，证明了强大的平均改进和跨语言迁移能力。

Conclusion: 通过将视觉和文本内容整合到单一图像中，并利用合成数据进行微调，可以有效提升科学视觉问答任务的性能，特别是在多语言场景下表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Scientific visual question answering poses significant challenges for
vision-language models due to the complexity of scientific figures and their
multimodal context. Traditional approaches treat the figure and accompanying
text (e.g., questions and answer options) as separate inputs. EXAMS-V
introduced a new paradigm by embedding both visual and textual content into a
single image. However, even state-of-the-art proprietary models perform poorly
on this setup in zero-shot settings, underscoring the need for task-specific
fine-tuning. To address the scarcity of training data in this "text-in-image"
format, we synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text
pairs into unified images. Fine-tuning a small multilingual multimodal model on
a mix of our synthetic data and EXAMS-V yields notable gains across 13
languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and cross-lingual
transfer.

TL;DR: 论文提出了EchoBench基准来评估医学大型视觉语言模型中的谄媚行为（sycophancy），发现所有模型都存在显著的谄媚问题，即使是最优模型也有45.98%的谄媚率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学LVLM基准过于关注准确率而忽视了可靠性和安全性，特别是在高风险临床环境中模型盲目回应用户偏见信息的风险。

Method: 构建包含2,122张图像、18个科室、20种模态的EchoBench基准，使用90个模拟偏见的提示词来评估模型的谄媚行为。

Result: 所有评估模型都表现出显著的谄媚行为，医疗专用模型谄媚率超过95%，而准确率仅为中等水平。通过细粒度分析识别了影响谄媚敏感性的因素。

Conclusion: 需要超越准确率的鲁棒评估方法，提高数据质量和领域知识可以减少谄媚行为而不损害无偏见准确率，简单的提示干预能有效缓解谄媚问题。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) emphasize
leaderboard accuracy, overlooking reliability and safety. We study sycophancy
-- models' tendency to uncritically echo user-provided information -- in
high-stakes clinical settings. We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to
systematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images
across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased
inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate
medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial
sycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98%
sycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95%
sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type,
department, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase
susceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger
domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench
also serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions
(negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and
motivate training- and decoding-time strategies. Our findings highlight the
need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy and provide actionable guidance
toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆依赖AI系统，透明度和安全性至关重要。后置解释为黑盒AI模型提供透明度，但其质量和可靠性常因不一致性和缺乏忠实性而受到质疑。

Method: 通过大量实证评估，比较自然训练、对抗训练和剪枝三种训练方法对交通标志分类器后置解释（使用显著图）质量的影响。

Result: 剪枝显著增强了解释的可理解性和忠实度，不仅提高了模型效率，还强制学习表示的稀疏性，导致更可解释和可靠的决策。

Conclusion: 剪枝是开发透明深度学习模型的有前景策略，特别是在资源受限的车载AI系统中。

Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles continue to heavily rely on AI systems,
where transparency and security are critical for trust and operational safety.
Post-hoc explanations provide transparency to these black-box like AI models
but the quality and reliability of these explanations is often questioned due
to inconsistencies and lack of faithfulness in representing model decisions.
This paper systematically examines the impact of three widely used training
approaches, namely natural training, adversarial training, and pruning, affect
the quality of post-hoc explanations for traffic sign classifiers. Through
extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that pruning significantly
enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations (using saliency
maps). Our findings reveal that pruning not only improves model efficiency but
also enforces sparsity in learned representation, leading to more interpretable
and reliable decisions. Additionally, these insights suggest that pruning is a
promising strategy for developing transparent deep learning models, especially
in resource-constrained vehicular AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的双因果图MIL模型C²MIL，通过语义因果干预和拓扑因果发现来解决WSI生存分析中的语义偏差和拓扑噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于图的MIL方法在H&E染色WSI生存分析中广泛使用，但染色和扫描变化会引入语义偏差，而与因果关系无关的拓扑子图会产生噪声，导致偏置的幻灯片级表示，影响分析的可解释性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出了双结构因果模型作为理论基础，包含跨尺度自适应特征解缠模块进行语义因果干预，以及伯努利可微分因果子图采样方法进行拓扑因果发现，结合解缠监督和对比学习的联合优化策略。

Result: 实验表明C²MIL相比现有方法持续提升了泛化能力和可解释性，可作为多种MIL基线的因果增强方法。

Conclusion: C²MIL通过同时优化语义和拓扑因果关系，有效解决了WSI生存分析中的偏差和噪声问题，提高了模型的泛化性和可解释性。

Abstract: Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in survival
analysis with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs)
due to its ability to capture topological information. However, variations in
staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs
that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting
in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the
interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we
introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and
propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL.
C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module
for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal
subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization
strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables
simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities.
Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and
interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement
for diverse MIL baselines. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT图像中牙齿和牙髓的手动分割需要专业知识和大量时间，亟需能够有效利用未标注数据的自动化算法。

Method: 基于U-Mamba2模型，采用多阶段训练策略：自监督预训练使用破坏性自编码器；通过输入和特征扰动进行一致性正则化；采用降低损失权重的伪标签策略减少错误影响。

Result: 在验证集上获得平均得分0.872和DSC 0.969，表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: U-Mamba2-SSL框架在CBCT牙齿和牙髓分割任务中表现出色，为临床应用提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography
(CBCT) is vital for clinical applications like treatment planning and
diagnosis. However, this process requires extensive expertise and is
exceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated
algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we
propose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on
the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework
first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive
autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency
regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure
stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a
reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL
achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation
dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下机器视觉开发面临挑战，主要由于缺乏能够考虑光学挑战（如颜色失真、对比度降低、散射等）的受控测试环境，且现有评估往往缺乏泛化性。

Method: 引入光学海洋配方框架，使用校准的颜色和散射添加剂，在受控条件下创建真实水下数据集，支持可重复测试。

Result: 提供了演示数据集，展示了系统在水下视觉任务中的应用，包括水参数估计、图像恢复等。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析水下机器视觉提供了独特工具，能够在真实但受控的场景中进行评估，数据集和评估代码将公开。

Abstract: The development and evaluation of machine vision in underwater environments
remains challenging, often relying on trial-and-error-based testing tailored to
specific applications. This is partly due to the lack of controlled,
ground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges,
such as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced
contrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light
patterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance
of ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and
seasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific
optical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack
generalizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is
technically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Optical
Ocean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled
underwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes,
using calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and
controlled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance.
Hence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in
realistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment
enables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks,
including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual
SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset
generated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of
our system for two underwater vision tasks. The dataset and evaluation code
will be made available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对视觉语言建模自动驾驶系统的通用伪装攻击框架UCA，通过在特征空间操作生成物理可实现的伪装纹理，显著提升了攻击效果和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法主要针对视觉模块或停留在数字层面，难以直接应用于VLM-AD系统。VLM-AD在编码器和投影层存在安全漏洞，需要开发针对性的物理对抗攻击方法。

Method: UCA框架引入特征差异损失最大化干净和对抗图像的表征差异，采用多尺度学习策略和采样比例调整，增强对现实场景中尺度和视角变化的适应性。

Result: 实验表明UCA能在多种VLM-AD模型和驾驶场景中诱导错误驾驶指令，显著超越现有最优攻击方法（3-P指标提升30%），并在不同视角和动态条件下表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UCA是首个针对VLM-AD的通用物理对抗攻击框架，具有实际部署的高潜力，揭示了VLM-AD系统的安全脆弱性。

Abstract: Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising
research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning
capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains
vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve
misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing
attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily
target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD
systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)
Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital
level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage
Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on
optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate
physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization
across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the
observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA
introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational
discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates
a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its
adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world
scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various
VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing
state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore,
UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic
conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在几何可解释性和输入稀疏性鲁棒性方面的不足，3D传感器产生的点云通常稀疏且有噪声，需要密集高保真3D表示

Method: 使用各向异性3D高斯分布建模每个点的局部邻域，在局部几何域中通过直接点采样进行显式上采样，生成密集但粗糙的点云，然后通过细化网络调整输出以获得更均匀分布和更锐利的边缘

Result: 在PU1K和PUGAN数据集上进行了广泛测试，证明了PU-Gaussian达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该方法克服了现有方法的局限性，实现了高质量的点云上采样，代码和模型权重已公开

Abstract: Point clouds produced by 3D sensors are often sparse and noisy, posing
challenges for tasks requiring dense and high-fidelity 3D representations.
Prior work has explored both implicit feature-based upsampling and
distance-function learning to address this, but often at the expense of
geometric interpretability or robustness to input sparsity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PU-Gaussian, a novel upsampling network that models the
local neighborhood around each point using anisotropic 3D Gaussian
distributions. These Gaussians capture the underlying geometric structure,
allowing us to perform upsampling explicitly in the local geometric domain by
direct point sampling. The sampling process generates a dense, but coarse,
point cloud. A subsequent refinement network adjusts the coarse output to
produce a more uniform distribution and sharper edges. We perform extensive
testing on the PU1K and PUGAN datasets, demonstrating that PU-Gaussian achieves
state-of-the-art performance. We make code and model weights publicly available
at https://github.com/mvg-inatech/PU-Gaussian.git.

*Tom Burgert,Oliver Stoll,Paolo Rota,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究重新审视了CNN具有纹理偏见的假设，通过提出一个领域无关的框架来量化特征依赖，发现CNN主要依赖局部形状特征而非纹理，且这种依赖可以通过现代训练策略或架构缓解。不同领域的模型表现出不同的特征依赖模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新检验Geirhos等人的线索冲突实验的局限性，挑战CNN天生具有纹理偏见的普遍假设，旨在更准确地量化神经网络对形状、纹理和颜色特征的依赖程度。

Method: 提出领域无关框架，通过系统性地抑制形状、纹理和颜色线索来量化特征依赖，避免强制选择冲突的混淆因素。在受控抑制条件下评估人类和神经网络的表现。

Result: 发现CNN并非天生纹理偏见，而是主要依赖局部形状特征。现代训练策略或架构（如ConvNeXt、ViTs）可以显著缓解这种依赖。不同领域模型的特征依赖模式存在系统性差异：计算机视觉模型优先形状，医学影像模型强调颜色，遥感模型更依赖纹理。

Conclusion: CNN的特征依赖模式比先前认为的更复杂，并非固有纹理偏见，而是受训练策略和架构影响。不同应用领域的模型会根据任务特性发展出不同的特征偏好，这对理解模型行为和设计更有效的架构具有重要意义。

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently
texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep
learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the
cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we
propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through
systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the
confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks
under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently
texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless,
this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies
or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across
computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance
patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape,
medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a
stronger reliance towards texture. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于跨视图纹理传递的CT切片插值方法，通过利用3D CT体积的各向异性特性，将高分辨率平面内纹理细节转移到低分辨率平面间图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中CT图像通常具有较大的切片厚度，导致各向异性的3D体积，平面间分辨率远低于平面内分辨率，这种不一致的分辨率可能导致疾病诊断困难。

Method: 设计了一个独特的框架，采用高分辨率平面内纹理细节作为参考，将其转移到低分辨率平面间图像。引入了多参考非局部注意力模块，从多个平面内图像中提取有意义的特征来重建平面间高频细节。

Result: 在公共CT数据集（包括真实配对基准）上的广泛实验表明，该方法在CT切片插值方面的性能显著优于现有竞争方法。

Conclusion: 验证了所提出框架的有效性，能够充分利用3D CT体积的各向异性特性进行高质量的切片插值。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used non-invasive imaging
modalities for medical diagnosis. In clinical practice, CT images are usually
acquired with large slice thicknesses due to the high cost of memory storage
and operation time, resulting in an anisotropic CT volume with much lower
inter-slice resolution than in-plane resolution. Since such inconsistent
resolution may lead to difficulties in disease diagnosis, deep learning-based
volumetric super-resolution methods have been developed to improve inter-slice
resolution. Most existing methods conduct single-image super-resolution on the
through-plane or synthesize intermediate slices from adjacent slices; however,
the anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volume has not been well explored. In
this paper, we propose a novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT
slice interpolation by fully utilizing the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volume.
Specifically, we design a unique framework that takes high-resolution in-plane
texture details as a reference and transfers them to low-resolution
through-plane images. To this end, we introduce a multi-reference non-local
attention module that extracts meaningful features for reconstructing
through-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs significantly
better in CT slice interpolation than existing competing methods on public CT
datasets including a real-paired benchmark, verifying the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. The source code of this work is available at

Conclusion: PhiGenesis成功实现了动态4D驾驶场景的生成，解决了时间外推和新视角合成的挑战，为4D场景生成提供了有效的统一框架。

Abstract: Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes
that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view
synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel
view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified
framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with
geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera
parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting
representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis
leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable
feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture
supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including
geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a
geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as
priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address
geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel
conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising.
This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative
influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view
synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance
in downstream evaluations. Homepage is at

Motivation: 解决现有乳腺X线摄影基础模型在训练数据多样性不足、模型泛化能力有限以及缺乏全面临床评估等方面的局限性。

Method: 采用两阶段预训练策略：首先通过自监督学习训练教师模型提取可迁移特征，然后结合监督学习和知识蒸馏将特征和临床知识转移到VersaMammo模型中。

Result: 在包含92个具体任务的基准测试中，VersaMammo在68个内部任务中50个排名第一，24个外部验证任务中20个排名第一，平均排名分别为1.5和1.2。

Conclusion: VersaMammo展示了卓越的泛化能力和临床实用性，为实现可靠和可扩展的乳腺癌筛查和诊断提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of
cancer-related mortality in women globally. Mammography is essential for the
early detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. Despite recent progress in
foundation models (FMs) for mammogram analysis, their clinical translation
remains constrained by several fundamental limitations, including insufficient
diversity in training data, limited model generalizability, and a lack of
comprehensive evaluation across clinically relevant tasks. Here, we introduce
VersaMammo, a versatile foundation model for mammograms, designed to overcome
these limitations. We curated the largest multi-institutional mammogram dataset
to date, comprising 706,239 images from 21 sources. To improve generalization,
we propose a two-stage pre-training strategy to develop VersaMammo, a mammogram
foundation model. First, a teacher model is trained via self-supervised
learning to extract transferable features from unlabeled mammograms. Then,
supervised learning combined with knowledge distillation transfers both
features and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo. To ensure a comprehensive
evaluation, we established a benchmark comprising 92 specific tasks, including
68 internal tasks and 24 external validation tasks, spanning 5 major clinical
task categories: lesion detection, segmentation, classification, image
retrieval, and visual question answering. VersaMammo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, ranking first in 50 out of 68 specific internal tasks and 20 out
of 24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2,
respectively. These results demonstrate its superior generalization and
clinical utility, offering a substantial advancement toward reliable and
scalable breast cancer screening and diagnosis.

TL;DR: 本文提出HiPerformer模型，通过模块化分层架构和局部-全局特征融合模块，解决医学图像分割中CNN-Transformer混合架构的特征不一致问题，在11个公开数据集上表现出更高的分割精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CNN-Transformer混合架构的方法采用简单的特征融合技术（如串行堆叠、端点拼接或点加），难以处理特征间的不一致性，容易导致信息冲突和丢失。

Method: HiPerformer编码器采用模块化分层架构，动态并行融合多源特征；设计局部-全局特征融合模块实现精确高效的特征整合；提出渐进金字塔聚合模块替代传统跳跃连接以增强多尺度特征表示能力。

Result: 在11个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有分割技术，具有更高的分割精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HiPerformer通过创新的架构设计有效解决了医学图像分割中的特征融合问题，为异构信息的高效整合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Both local details and global context are crucial in medical image
segmentation, and effectively integrating them is essential for achieving high
accuracy. However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid
architectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial
stacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to
address the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information
conflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively
propose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular
hierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in
parallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information.
The modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling
capability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient
information transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of
features and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods.
Furthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve
precise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic
information, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and
resulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance
multi-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise
interference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to
replace traditional skip connections. Experiments on eleven public datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing segmentation
techniques, demonstrating higher segmentation accuracy and robustness. The code
is available at https://github.com/xzphappy/HiPerformer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于人类感知的人脸相似性度量方法，通过创建包含6400个三元组标注的数据集和度量学习来预测人脸相似度，以解决现有方法在平衡匿名性和自然性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社会对隐私问题的关注增加，人脸匿名化技术不断发展，包括人脸替换方法。在平衡匿名性和自然性时，需要仔细选择身份：过于相似的人脸会损害匿名性，而差异过大的人脸会降低自然性。现有模型主要关注二元身份分类（是否同一人），难以衡量细微的相似度差异。

Method: 提出基于人类感知的人脸相似性度量方法，创建包含6400个三元组标注的数据集，并采用度量学习来预测人脸相似度。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在人脸相似性预测和基于属性的人脸分类任务上相比现有方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的基于人类感知的人脸相似性度量方法能够有效解决现有方法在衡量细微相似度方面的不足，为人脸匿名化技术提供了更精确的相似性评估工具。

Abstract: In response to rising societal awareness of privacy concerns, face
anonymization techniques have advanced, including the emergence of
face-swapping methods that replace one identity with another. Achieving a
balance between anonymity and naturalness in face swapping requires careful
selection of identities: overly similar faces compromise anonymity, while
dissimilar ones reduce naturalness. Existing models, however, focus on binary
identity classification "the same person or not", making it difficult to
measure nuanced similarities such as "completely different" versus "highly
similar but different." This paper proposes a human-perception-based face
similarity metric, creating a dataset of 6,400 triplet annotations and metric
learning to predict the similarity. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in both face similarity prediction and attribute-based
face classification tasks over existing methods.

TL;DR: FAST是一种前景感知的扩散框架，通过AIAS和FARM两个模块实现高效的工业异常合成，在10步内生成最先进的分割导向异常，显著提升下游分割任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常分割严重依赖像素级标注，但真实世界的异常稀缺、多样且标注成本高。现有SIAS方法难以平衡采样效率和生成质量，且忽视异常区域与背景区域的统计差异，导致无法合成可控的、结构特定的异常。

Method: 提出FAST框架，包含两个核心模块：AIAS（异常感知加速采样）是一种无需训练的采样算法，通过粗到细聚合加速反向过程；FARM（前景感知重建模块）在采样过程中自适应调整掩码前景区域内的异常感知噪声，保持局部异常信号。

Result: 在多个工业基准测试上的广泛实验表明，FAST在10步内就能合成最先进的分割导向异常，并在下游分割任务中持续优于现有异常合成方法。

Conclusion: FAST通过前景感知的扩散框架有效解决了工业异常合成中的效率和质量平衡问题，为分割任务提供了高质量的异常合成解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations,
yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label.
Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a
promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling
efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial
regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between
anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of
controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In
this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring
two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the
Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling
algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly
synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine
aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented
anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the
anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step,
preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory.
Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST
consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream
segmentation tasks. We release the code at:

TL;DR: 该研究针对农业中鹿类入侵造成的经济损失问题，开发了一个公开的鹿检测数据集，并比较了12种YOLO模型变体在边缘设备上的性能，发现YOLOv11n、YOLOv8s和YOLOv9s在准确性和效率方面达到最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鹿类入侵缓解策略劳动密集、成本高且效果有限，而现有研究缺乏针对性的数据集和实际部署评估，阻碍了智能自主解决方案的发展。

Result: 树莓派5无法实现实时检测，而NVIDIA Jetson在GPU加速推理下可实现大于30 FPS；YOLOv11n、YOLOv8s和YOLOv9s模型在准确率（AP@.5 > 0.85）和计算效率（FPS > 30）方面表现最优。

Conclusion: 该研究为农业鹿类检测提供了实用的数据集和模型评估基准，证明了小型先进模型在边缘设备上的可行性，支持了智能农业防护系统的开发。

Abstract: The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion,
estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S.,
highlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies since these
methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming
systems. To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous
solutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress
in this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the
lack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field
deployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study
presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models
for deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of
this work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available
dataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,
derived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive
comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO
architectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a
high-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing
platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the
real-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific
model optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with
GPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals
that smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and
YOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and
computational efficiency (FPS > 30). To support further research, both the
source code and datasets are publicly available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于纯拼接范式的虚拟试穿方法，通过空间拼接姿态数据来增强姿态控制，并引入了混合掩码训练策略来支持灵活的产品集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线购物的发展，虚拟试穿技术需求激增。姿态控制是虚拟试穿中的关键挑战，需要在不增加额外参数的情况下准确对齐产品与用户身体，同时支持多样化的姿态以提供更沉浸的体验。

Method: 在基线VTON模型基础上，通过空间拼接姿态数据（比较姿态图和骨架两种表示），不添加额外参数或模块。同时引入混合掩码训练策略，使用细粒度掩码和边界框掩码来支持不同姿态和条件下的灵活产品集成。

Result: 实验表明，使用姿态图进行拼接的方法效果最佳，既能增强姿态保持能力，又能提高输出真实感。混合掩码训练策略有效提升了模型在不同姿态和条件下的适应性。

Conclusion: 纯拼接范式结合姿态图表示和混合掩码训练，能够在保持模型简洁性的同时有效提升虚拟试穿系统的姿态控制能力和输出质量。

Abstract: As online shopping continues to grow, the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTON)
technology has surged, allowing customers to visualize products on themselves
by overlaying product images onto their own photos. An essential yet
challenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures
accurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse
orientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose
conditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting
the optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional
parameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.
  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the
reference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex
attention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this
pure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing
performance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional
parameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose
stitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose
preservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask
training strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model
to support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.

Abstract: Existing video generation models excel at producing photo-realistic videos
from text or images, but often lack physical plausibility and 3D
controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel
framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical
parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that
learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic,
sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics
parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point
trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations
generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel
spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and
incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical
plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic,
physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video
models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing
methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility. Project Page:

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models highlight a clear trend toward
unification and scaling, showing emergent capabilities across diverse domains.
While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific
to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to
architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce
EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing
within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and
video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to
achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and
flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and
durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a
scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines
them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore,
we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video
editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user
studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting
emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.
