*Christina Thrainer,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Christian Guetl,Steven Sloan,Kendall N. Niles,Ken Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出增强特征金字塔网络(E-FPN)用于基础设施检查中的少样本语义分割，通过原型学习和注意力机制在数据稀缺情况下有效识别新的缺陷类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施检查中标注数据稀缺且昂贵的问题，以及现有深度学习模型无法用少量数据学习新缺陷类别的局限性。

Method: 使用自适应E-FPN编码器、原型学习框架和注意力机制，包括全局自注意力、局部自注意力和交叉注意力，进行多尺度特征提取和原型生成。

Result: 在基础设施检查数据集上取得优异性能，最佳配置在8-way 5-shot训练下达到82.55% F1分数和72.26% mIoU，注意力机制带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够用有限的新训练数据快速响应基础设施检查系统中的新缺陷类型，实现更高效经济的维护计划。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

### [2] [SkinMap: Weighted Full-Body Skin Segmentation for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05296)
*Zahra Maleki,Amirhossein Akbari,Amirhossein Binesh,Babak Khalaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的皮肤分割技术，用于改进远程光电容积描记术(rPPG)中的心率监测，通过在视频中优先选择皮肤区域来提升信号质量，并在具有挑战性的条件下保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程光电容积描记术(rPPG)是一种低成本、非接触式的心率和生命体征监测方法，但对光照和运动敏感。现有方法需要从视频中选择皮肤区域来提取rPPG信号，因此需要改进皮肤分割技术以提高信号质量。

Method: 引入了一种新颖的皮肤分割技术，能够检测全身皮肤区域，同时去除可能造成干扰的区域（如嘴、眼、头发），使系统对运动更具鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集上评估显示，该模型在具有挑战性的条件（如说话和头部旋转）下能够有效捕捉心跳，并保持预测心率与实际心率之间的平均绝对误差(MAE)，而其他方法无法做到。此外，在检测各种肤色方面表现出高准确性。

Conclusion: 该技术为现实世界应用提供了一个有前景的选择，特别是在处理运动和不同肤色条件下的rPPG监测方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

### [3] [DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315)
*Yousef Yeganeh,Maximilian Frantzen,Michael Lee,Kun-Hsing Yu,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DeepAf自动对焦框架，结合空间和光谱特征的混合架构进行单次对焦预测，将传统显微镜转变为高效玻片扫描仪，在资源受限环境中实现实时数字病理学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全玻片成像扫描仪成本高昂，现有低成本方案存在对焦不一致、耗时或泛化能力差等问题，需要开发更高效、通用的自动对焦解决方案。

Method: DeepAf框架通过混合架构提取空间和光谱特征，自动回归到最佳焦点的距离，使用单张输入图像进行对焦预测，无需多图像输入或焦堆栈。

Result: 对焦时间比堆栈方法减少80%，对焦精度达0.18μm，与双图像方法相当但输入需求减半，交叉实验室泛化能力强，假对焦预测仅0.72%。在536个脑组织样本的临床研究中，4x放大倍数下癌症分类AUC达0.90。

Conclusion: 该系统提供全面的硬件-软件设计，在资源受限环境中实现可访问的实时数字病理学，同时保持诊断准确性。

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

### [5] [Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)
*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出动态引导方法，在生成过程中选择性锐化导致伪影的分数函数方向，减少扩散模型的结构不一致幻觉，同时保留有效的语义变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型经常产生结构不一致的幻觉样本，这些样本超出了真实数据分布的支持范围。虽然语义插值有助于生成多样性，但需要更精细的解决方案来处理幻觉问题。

Method: 引入动态引导方法，通过仅沿已知导致伪影的预定方向选择性锐化分数函数，来减轻幻觉，同时保留有效的语义变化。

Result: 动态引导在受控和自然图像数据集上显著减少了幻觉，明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在生成时而非通过后处理过滤来解决幻觉问题的方法，能够有效平衡幻觉减少和生成多样性。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [6] [LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Yushu Wu,Zheng Zhan,Yanzhi Wang,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练免费的视频生成加速方法LightCache，通过分析扩散模型推理过程中的编码、去噪和解码阶段，针对性地设计了异步缓存交换、特征分块和切片解码三种策略来降低内存消耗，同时保持加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理过程中存在潜在冗余，基于缓存的加速方法往往在去噪和解码阶段导致内存激增，需要解决内存消耗问题。

Method: 将推理过程分解为编码、去噪和解码三个阶段，针对不同阶段特点提出：1）异步缓存交换 2）特征分块 3）切片解码，确保额外时间开销低于加速收益。

Result: 与基线相比，实现了更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用，同时质量下降保持在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: LightCache方法在保持加速效果的同时有效降低了内存消耗，为视频生成扩散模型提供了实用的训练免费加速方案。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is
available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### [7] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于热成像和RGB图像的时间反转重建框架，利用视觉语言模型和约束扩散过程来恢复几秒前的场景状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像能捕捉人类与环境的交互残留热痕迹，这些痕迹可作为被动时间编码，用于推断近期事件，超越RGB相机的能力。

Method: 将视觉语言模型与约束扩散过程耦合，一个VLM生成场景描述，另一个指导图像重建，确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 在三个受控场景中评估，证明能够重建120秒前的合理过去帧。

Conclusion: 这是从热痕迹进行时间反转成像的第一步，展示了从热残留恢复过去场景状态的可行性。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

### [8] [Personalizing Retrieval using Joint Embeddings or "the Return of Fluffy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05411)
*Bruno Korbar,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为pi-map的可训练映射网络，能够将图像中的对象实例信息转换为文本标记，结合自然语言查询进行CLIP风格的图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复合查询的图像检索问题，即结合图像中的对象实例信息和自然语言描述来检索特定图像，例如检索"某人的头上的Fluffy独角兽"这样的图像。

Method: 设计了一个映射网络，将局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，使该标记与自然语言查询组合后适合CLIP风格的文本编码和图像检索。每个对象实例只需训练一次映射网络。

Result: 在个性化检索的两个基准测试中，该方法结合可训练的pi-map映射网络和冻结的CLIP文本图像编码器，提升了现有技术水平。

Conclusion: 提出的pi-map方法能够有效处理复合查询的图像检索任务，在个性化检索基准上取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [9] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead是首个支持连续控制细节级别的3D高斯头部化身框架，通过2D UV特征空间参数化高斯点，实现渲染效率与视觉质量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS化身使用固定数量的高斯点，无法根据实际需求调整细节级别，限制了在需要平衡渲染效率和视觉质量的应用中的实用性。

Method: 提出UV特征场和多级可学习特征图来编码高斯点的潜在特征，通过轻量级神经网络解码器将特征转换为3D高斯属性，通过动态重采样特征图控制高斯点数量。

Result: 在最高细节级别实现SOTA质量，最低细节级别仅使用6.2%的高斯点，质量适度下降（L1损失+7.9%等），渲染速度几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: ArchitectHead无需重新训练即可实现细节级别的连续控制，在保持高质量的同时显著提升渲染效率，为实际应用提供了灵活性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

### [10] [Human Action Recognition from Point Clouds over Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05506)
*James Dickens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D点云的动作识别新方法，结合点云分割、人体跟踪和体素映射技术，在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上达到89.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着消费级深度传感器和激光雷达的普及，利用密集3D数据进行动作识别成为可能，为骨骼动作识别和视频方法之外的第三种途径提供机会。

Method: 构建了一个处理3D视频的完整流程：从场景中分割人体点云、跟踪个体、进行身体部位分割，核心是结合点云技术和稀疏卷积网络的新型3D动作识别骨干网络。

Result: 在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上表现优异，与现有骨骼动作识别算法相当，通过集成传感器深度和估计深度输入，在跨主体测试中达到89.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了利用3D点云数据进行动作识别的可行性，为基于密集3D数据的动作识别提供了新的技术路径，性能优于之前的点云动作识别方法。

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

TL;DR: 提出了基于黎曼度量的扩散模型插值方法，通过噪声空间的几何结构生成更自然的数据流形感知过渡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型缺乏显式的低维潜在空间，限制了流形感知的分析和操作，现有插值方法产生不自然的过渡

Method: 在噪声空间中定义黎曼度量，利用分数函数雅可比矩阵捕获数据流形切空间，计算流形感知的测地线

Result: 图像插值实验显示，该方法比现有基于密度和朴素方法产生更自然、更忠实的过渡效果

Conclusion: 提出的黎曼度量方法能够有效利用扩散模型学习的数据流形结构，改善插值质量

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

### [12] [Teamwork: Collaborative Diffusion with Low-rank Coordination and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05532)
*Sam Sartor,Pieter Peers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teamwork是一个灵活统一的解决方案，通过协调多个基础扩散模型实例来扩展输入输出通道，无需改变预训练扩散模型架构，支持多种图形任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道扩展方法通常是特定于应用的，难以适应不同的扩散模型或新任务，需要一个更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 使用多个基础扩散模型实例（队友）进行协调，采用改进的低秩适应（LoRA）技术同时处理适应和协调问题，支持队友的动态激活/停用。

Result: Teamwork在多种生成和逆向图形任务中表现出灵活性和高效性，包括修复、SVBRDF估计、本征分解、神经着色和本征图像合成。

Conclusion: Teamwork提供了一个统一且高效的框架，能够在不修改预训练模型架构的情况下扩展通道并适应新任务。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

### [13] [Seeing the Big Picture: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs' Ability to Interpret and Grade Handwritten Student Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05538)
*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

### [14] [Midway Network: Learning Representations for Recognition and Motion from Latent Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05558)
*Christopher Hoang,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Midway Network是一种自监督学习架构，首次能够仅从自然视频中同时学习物体识别和运动理解的强视觉表示，通过将潜在动态建模扩展到该领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法主要关注识别或运动的单一表示，而物体识别和运动理解作为感知的两个关键组件应该互补。潜在动态建模在决策制定中已用于学习观测的潜在表示及其随时间变化，但尚未应用于视觉表示学习。

Method: Midway Network采用中间自顶向下路径推断视频帧之间的运动潜在变量，使用密集前向预测目标和分层结构来处理自然视频中复杂的多物体场景。

Result: 在两个大规模自然视频数据集上预训练后，Midway Network在语义分割和光流任务上相对于先前的自监督学习方法表现出强性能。

Conclusion: Midway Network能够同时学习物体识别和运动理解的表示，其学习的动态可以通过前向特征扰动的新分析方法捕捉高级对应关系。

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis

TL;DR: HoloScene是一个新颖的交互式3D重建框架，通过统一的能量优化方法，同时实现几何完整性、物体交互性、物理合理性和真实渲染，用于创建精确的数字孪生环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D重建和场景理解方法在几何完整性、物体交互性、物理合理性、真实渲染或可靠动态模拟等方面存在不足，需要一种能同时满足这些关键要求的解决方案。

Method: 采用基于能量的优化问题，结合观测数据、物理约束和生成先验，通过采样探索和梯度细化的混合方法进行高效优化，使用交互式场景图表示编码物体几何、外观、物理属性及层次关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，生成的数字孪生具有完整精确的几何结构、物理稳定性和新颖视角下的真实渲染效果。

Conclusion: HoloScene在交互式游戏和实时数字孪生操作等实际应用中展示了广泛的适用性和有效性，为物理世界的数字化提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: CalibCLIP是一个无需训练的方法，通过校准主导令牌的抑制效应来改进文本驱动图像检索任务中的视觉语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型存在结构限制，少数低贡献令牌可能过度捕捉全局语义，主导信息聚合过程并抑制判别性特征。

Method: 在视觉空间提出对比视觉增强器(CVE)，将视觉特征解耦为目标和低信息区域，识别主导令牌并动态抑制其表示；在文本空间提出判别概念校准器(DCC)，区分文本查询中的通用和判别概念。

Result: 在涵盖三个图像检索任务的七个基准测试中均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: CalibCLIP能有效解决主导令牌过度影响的问题，提升文本驱动图像检索性能。

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ShortCoTI是一个轻量级优化框架，通过强化学习减少视觉思维链中的冗余内容，在保持图像质量的同时将提示推理长度减少54%，提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于思维链的多模态大语言模型在图像生成中存在视觉过度思考问题，即产生不必要的冗余内容，这会增加计算成本并可能引入与原始提示矛盾的细节。

Method: 提出ShortCoTI框架，使用自适应奖励函数根据任务难度鼓励更简洁的思维链，并将其整合到强化学习范式中。

Result: 在多个基准测试(T2I-CompBench, GenEval)上，推理长度减少54%的同时保持或略微提高了质量指标，消除了冗长解释和重复优化。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI能够在不影响生成图像保真度或视觉吸引力的前提下，显著提高计算效率，产生既简洁又语义丰富的推理提示。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

TL;DR: 提出了HOI-R1方法，首次探索语言模型在人类-物体交互检测任务中的潜力，无需额外检测模块，通过纯文本方式解决HOID任务，在HICO-DET数据集上达到基线方法2倍的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOID方法依赖VLMs的先验知识，训练策略和模型架构复杂；同时MLLMs在人类-物体交互检测中的推理能力未被充分探索。

Method: 引入HOI推理过程和HOID奖励函数，使用强化学习方法训练MLLMs，通过纯文本方式解决HOID任务。

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，HOI-R1达到基线方法2倍的准确率，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 证明了语言模型在HOID任务中的潜力，无需复杂检测模块即可实现高性能交互检测。

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出ECM（高效控制模型），一种即插即用的轻量级控制框架，通过分布式架构引入控制信号，结合上下文感知注意力层和共享门控前馈网络，以及早期中心采样策略，显著提升训练和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归模型在复杂空间条件生成中依赖预训练模型微调，导致高昂训练成本，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用轻量级控制模块，包含上下文感知注意力层（利用实时生成token细化条件特征）和共享门控FFN（最大化有限容量利用），并引入早期中心采样策略和温度调度。

Result: 在基于尺度的AR模型上验证，实现了高保真和多样化的图像生成控制，超越现有基线，显著提升训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: ECM框架为自回归模型提供了高效的控制能力，在保持生成质量的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointNSP提出了一种从粗到细的自回归点云生成框架，通过多尺度分解解决了传统自回归方法在无序点集上强加人工排序的问题，在生成质量上首次超越了扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归点云生成方法因对无序点集强加人工排序，导致模型难以捕捉长距离依赖关系，无法有效保持全局结构特性如对称性、一致拓扑和大尺度几何规律。

Method: 提出PointNSP框架，基于层次细节原则，采用从粗到细的生成策略，通过下一尺度预测范式在低分辨率保持全局形状结构，在高分辨率逐步细化几何细节。

Result: 在ShapeNet上的实验表明，PointNSP首次在自回归范式中达到最先进的生成质量，并在参数、训练和推理效率上超越了强扩散基线方法，在8192点的密集生成中优势更加明显。

Conclusion: PointNSP通过多尺度分解使自回归目标与点集的置换不变性对齐，实现了高质量、高效的点云生成，展示了良好的可扩展性潜力。

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Motivation: 泪膜破裂分析对干眼症诊断至关重要，但缺乏标注数据集和集成解决方案，使得自动化分割面临挑战。

Method: 创建TFM数据集（15个高清视频，6,247帧），提出TF-Net分割模型（使用MobileOne-mini骨干网和增强特征金字塔），设计TF-Collab集成管道（顺序执行帧分类、瞳孔定位和TFBU分割）。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个泪膜多任务数据集和高效的自动化分析解决方案，推动了干眼症诊断技术的发展。

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

TL;DR: InstaGeo是一个开源端到端框架，解决了地理空间基础模型部署的两个主要限制：缺乏自动化地理空间数据管道和大尺寸微调模型。它集成了自动数据整理、任务特定模型蒸馏和无缝部署功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地理空间基础模型缺乏处理原始卫星图像的工作流程，下游适配通常保留原始编码器的全部复杂性，限制了实际部署。

Method: InstaGeo框架整合了三个核心组件：(1) 自动数据整理将原始图像转换为模型就绪数据集；(2) 任务特定模型蒸馏得到紧凑、计算高效的模型；(3) 作为交互式网络地图应用的无缝部署。

Result: 在三个已发表研究中复现数据集，模型性能差异很小：洪水映射-0.73pp，作物分割-0.20pp，沙漠蝗虫预测+1.79pp。蒸馏模型比标准微调模型小8倍，减少FLOPs和CO2排放。更大的作物分割数据集实现了60.65%的mIoU，比先前基线提高12pp。

Conclusion: InstaGeo通过统一数据准备、模型压缩和部署，将研究级地理空间基础模型转变为实用的低碳工具，用于实时大规模地球观测，推动地理空间AI向数据质量和应用驱动创新转变。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的合成图像检测器通常被视为黑盒，不清楚它们是否真正依赖频谱域中的周期性峰值作为检测指标，这限制了检测器的可解释性和可信度。

Method: 提出了从图像中去除频谱峰值的策略，分析此操作对多个检测器的影响；同时引入了一个仅依赖频率峰值的简单线性检测器作为完全可解释的基准。

Result: 研究发现大多数检测器并不从根本上依赖频谱峰值，挑战了该领域的普遍假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发更透明和可靠的取证工具铺平了道路，强调了需要超越频谱峰值依赖的检测方法。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

Motivation: 双曲空间能够表示更丰富的结构（如树结构），但双曲空间中的监督代理损失尚未被报道，而代理损失在大规模数据集上具有较低的训练复杂度。

Method: 提出CHEST损失函数，包含双曲空间和欧几里得空间的代理损失，以及基于双曲层次聚类的正则化损失。

Result: 双曲空间和欧几里得空间的组合提高了DML的准确性和学习稳定性，在四个基准数据集上实现了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CHEST损失通过结合双曲和欧几里得空间的优势，有效解决了双曲空间中代理损失的应用问题，并提升了深度度量学习的性能。

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了两个深度学习框架：AHP-CADNet用于眼源性异常头位姿势的自动诊断，以及基于课程学习的插补框架处理临床数据缺失问题，在PoseGaze-AHP数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前眼源性异常头位姿势的临床评估主要依赖主观判断，且受不完整医疗记录影响，需要开发自动化诊断工具来改善诊断准确性和效率。

Method: 提出两个互补框架：1）AHP-CADNet多级注意力融合框架，整合眼部标志点、头部姿态特征和结构化临床属性；2）基于课程学习的插补框架，逐步利用结构化和非结构化临床数据来处理缺失数据。

Result: AHP-CADNet在分类任务中达到96.9-99.0%准确率，连续变量预测MAE为0.103-0.199，R²超过0.93；插补框架在所有临床变量上保持93.46-99.78%准确率，临床依赖建模显著改善性能(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: 两个框架在自动诊断和处理临床数据缺失方面均表现出有效性，为临床环境中的眼源性异常头位姿势诊断提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有教育AI方法主要关注短期或单智能体设置，难以系统研究课堂复杂性和跨任务复用，而真实课堂包含开放式认知、动态社交互动、情感因素和多会话发展等要素。

Method: 采用分层CIE（认知-互动-演化）架构，支持环境、智能体和会话的自定义，并提供人机协同界面让真实用户加入模拟空间。

Result: 在初中语文课堂验证显示：教学对齐方面模拟IRF率(0.28-0.64)接近真实课堂(0.37-0.49)；群体互动中网络密度0.27-0.40，约三分之一同伴链接实现；跨会话演化中正向转换率R+平均增长11.7%。

Conclusion: EduVerse在真实性、可复现性和可解释性之间取得平衡，为教育AI提供了可扩展平台，系统将开源以促进跨学科研究。

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

Motivation: 现有基于脚本的视频摘要方法仅考虑视觉内容，忽略了语音文本与脚本的相关性，需要开发能同时利用视觉和语音内容的多模态方法。

Method: 提出SD-MVSum方法，使用加权跨模态注意力机制建模脚本-视频和脚本-文本两种模态对的依赖关系，利用语义相似性促进与脚本最相关的视频片段选择。

Conclusion: 同时利用视觉和语音内容的多模态方法能有效提升基于脚本的视频摘要性能，扩展的数据集为多模态视频摘要研究提供了支持。

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired

TL;DR: 提出ARGUS方法用于肝癌组织学分型，通过捕捉肿瘤微环境中的宏观-中观-微观层次信息，结合几何特征和分层视野对齐，实现更精确的肝癌亚型分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝癌是消化系统中最异质且预后差异大的癌症，其中肝细胞癌和肝内胆管癌具有复杂的组织形态和细胞结构。现有方法未能充分利用WSI中的层次金字塔结构、肿瘤微环境和几何表示等关键信息。

Method: ARGUS方法：1)构建微观几何特征表示细胞级模式；2)设计分层视野对齐模块建模宏观和中观层次交互；3)通过几何先验引导融合策略将增强的微观几何和视野特征融合为联合表示。

Result: 在公共和私有队列上的广泛实验表明，ARGUS在肝癌组织学分型中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ARGUS为原发性肝恶性肿瘤提供了一种有效的临床诊断工具，通过捕捉多层次信息显著提升了肝癌亚型分类性能。

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的统一流程，利用预训练扩散模型实现逼真的人类插入场景，结合反演技术和掩码引导自注意力机制，在保持身份特征的同时实现高质量个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往将人物定位和个性化视为独立问题，忽略了它们之间的相互联系，且通常需要训练才能达到高性能。

Method: 使用预训练文本到图像扩散模型，结合反演技术和无分类器引导实现全局编辑，提出掩码引导自注意力机制确保高质量个性化。

Result: 在多样化复合场景图像中实现了最先进的结果，在背景和主体身份保持方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 扩散模型本身具备在复杂场景中放置人物的知识，无需特定任务训练即可实现逼真的人类插入。

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于古典音乐会多摄像机录制自动编辑的多模态架构，解决了"何时剪切"和"如何剪切"两个关键子任务，在剪切点检测和视觉镜头选择方面优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化视频编辑在计算机视觉和多媒体领域仍未被充分探索，特别是与视频生成和场景理解相比。本文专注于解决古典音乐会多摄像机录制的编辑挑战。

Method: 将问题分解为两个子任务：时间分割（何时剪切）使用轻量级卷积-Transformer管道集成音频log-mel频谱图、可选图像嵌入和标量时间特征；空间选择（如何剪切）使用CLIP编码器替代旧骨干网络，并将干扰项选择限制在同一音乐会片段内。

Result: 模型在检测剪切点方面优于先前基线方法，在视觉镜头选择方面具有竞争力，推进了多模态自动化视频编辑的技术水平。

Conclusion: 本文提出的多模态架构在自动化视频编辑任务中表现出色，特别是在古典音乐会多摄像机录制编辑方面，为相关领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究立枯丝核菌(R. solani)接种对莴苣种子萌发和早期发育的影响，需要开发能够在复杂条件下准确监测幼苗生长的方法。

Method: 使用低成本图像监测系统连续捕获萌发过程图像，开发了结合形态和空间特征的新型图像分析管道，采用时间整合方法考虑发育历史来识别个体幼苗。

Result: R. solani感染显著降低了萌发率和早期幼苗活力。该方法在幼苗计数和活力评估方面表现出高准确性，决定系数为0.98，均方根误差为1.12。

Conclusion: 该方法在传统分割技术失效的复杂条件下仍能准确计数，证明了低成本成像硬件与先进计算工具结合进行非破坏性、可扩展表型数据获取的可行性。

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在从参考照片生成身份一致图像时，难以准确控制年龄同时保持身份，且微调通常需要跨年龄的昂贵配对图像。

Method: 利用衰老的线性特性，引入年龄条件提示混合和基于SVDMix矩阵融合技术的年龄特定LoRA融合策略，实现中间年龄肖像的高质量生成。

Result: AgeBooth能从单张参考图像生成不同年龄段的逼真且身份一致的人脸图像，在年龄控制和视觉质量方面优于先前最先进的基于编辑的方法。

Conclusion: AgeBooth提供了一种无需大量年龄标注数据的有效年龄控制解决方案，在年龄特定图像生成方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有合成图像检测研究主要关注跨生成器泛化，但忽略了同样重要的跨视觉域泛化挑战。需要开发能够同时应对这两种泛化挑战的检测器。

Method: 提出了FusionDetect方法，利用CLIP和Dinov2两个冻结的基础模型提取互补特征，构建统一的特征空间来适应生成器内容和设计的变化。

Result: FusionDetect在现有基准测试上比最接近的竞争对手准确率提高3.87%，平均精度提高6.13%；在OmniGen基准上准确率提高4.48%，并对常见图像扰动具有出色的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 不仅提出了性能最佳的检测器，还建立了新的基准测试和框架，为推进通用AI图像检测提供了基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 室外LiDAR点云的手动标注成本高昂且耗时，现有方法仍需人工标注。为完全消除对标注的依赖，开发无需标注的实例分割方法。

Method: 使用视觉基础模型生成初始伪标签，通过时空投票模块结合2D和3D语义进行优化，引入2D先验损失和原型对比损失进行语义监督。

Result: 在无监督3D实例分割中达到最先进水平，性能甚至超过使用2D边界框监督的方法MWSIS，mAP提升2.53%（50.95% vs 48.42%）。

Conclusion: ALISE证明了无需标注即可实现高质量LiDAR实例分割的可行性，为无监督3D视觉任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Motivation: 传统视觉搜索采用多阶段级联架构，查询图像和商品在不同阶段的表示存在差异，且各阶段优化目标冲突，难以在用户体验和转化率之间达到帕累托最优。

Method: 基于VRQ（视觉对齐残差量化编码）构建OneVision框架，对齐多视角下的对象表示，同时采用多阶段语义对齐方案，在保持视觉相似性先验的同时有效整合用户特定信息。

Conclusion: 以语义ID为中心的生成式架构能够统一检索和个性化，同时简化服务路径。

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用不可靠标签源来增强深度学习模型的训练效果，解决了遥感图像分类中高质量标签数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了OOD检测的新途径，并揭示了不同训练目标和模型架构对基于置信度的OOD检测方法的影响。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

Motivation: 传统方法仅从左心室体积曲线推导舒张末期和收缩末期帧，无法深入了解心肌运动模式。需要更精确的关键帧检测方法来消除个体心动周期差异对时间比较的影响。

Method: 使用自监督深度学习，从短轴和四腔心长轴电影CMR图像中提取密集可变形配准场，计算一维运动描述符，然后基于特征曲线使用简单规则确定关键帧。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上验证，相比基于体积的方法，舒张末期和收缩末期检测精度提高了30%-51%（短轴）和11%-47%（长轴），平均循环帧差低于1.31帧（短轴）和1.73帧（长轴）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现时间对齐的跨患者和患者内心脏动力学分析，不受心动周期或相位长度影响，为心脏动态分析提供了更深入的洞察。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

### [42] [Flow4Agent: Long-form Video Understanding via Motion Prior from Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05836)
*Ruyang Liu,Shangkun Sun,Haoran Tang,Ge Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent是一个利用光流运动先验来增强LLM长视频理解能力的新框架，通过时间粒度优化和运动token剪枝来减少视频冗余，在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临时空内容冗余和MLLM上下文长度有限的挑战，现有方法主要依赖CLIP模型的语义先验来提取关键信息，但缺乏对运动信息的有效利用。

Method: Flow4Agent包含两个核心模块：时间粒度优化(TGO)利用粗粒度光流先验分组相似视觉内容，再用语义先验过滤无关场景；运动token剪枝(MTP)利用细粒度光流信息剪枝高冗余视频token。

Result: 在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异，特别是在小时级视频理解任务上：Video-MME达到64.7%，MLVU达到71.4%，LongVideoBench达到60.4%。

Conclusion: Flow4Agent通过引入光流运动先验有效解决了长视频的冗余问题，在长视频理解任务上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

TL;DR: BioAutoML-NAS是一个使用多模态数据（图像和元数据）的自动机器学习模型，通过神经架构搜索自动学习最佳操作，结合多模态融合模块和交替双级优化训练策略，在昆虫分类任务上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫分类对农业管理和生态研究很重要，但由于昆虫特征复杂、类别不平衡和大规模数据集等挑战，传统方法效果有限。

Method: 使用神经架构搜索自动学习每个单元内的最佳操作，多模态融合模块结合图像嵌入和元数据，采用交替双级优化训练策略和零操作剪枝技术。

Result: 在BIOSCAN-5M数据集上达到96.81%准确率、97.46%精确率、96.81%召回率和97.05% F1分数，分别比现有最优方法提升约16%、10%和8%。在Insects-1M数据集上获得93.25%准确率。

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS提供了准确可靠的昆虫分类方案，能够支持现代可持续农业发展。

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在图像生成方面取得突破，但其基于离散token预测的生成方式带来了新的合成图像检测挑战，需要专门的方法来识别这类模型生成的图像。

Method: 引入离散分布差异感知的transformer，将动态码本频率统计集成到注意力机制中，融合语义特征和量化误差潜在表示。

Conclusion: D³QE方法能有效检测自回归生成的图像，为应对新兴视觉自回归模型带来的合成图像检测挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出弱监督上下文学习（WS-ICL），使用弱提示（如边界框或点）替代密集标签，显著减少医学图像分割的标注成本，性能与常规ICL相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用医学图像分割模型（交互式和上下文学习）需要大量标注，交互式模型需重复用户提示，ICL依赖密集像素级标签，标注成本高。

Method: 提出WS-ICL范式，利用弱提示（边界框或点）作为上下文，无需精细掩码和重复用户提示，降低标注工作量。

Result: 在三个测试基准上评估，WS-ICL性能与常规ICL相当，标注成本显著降低；在交互范式下也极具竞争力。

Conclusion: WS-ICL是实现更高效统一医学图像分割通用模型的有前景方向。

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于物流场景缺陷检测的大规模数据集，该数据集比现有基准大40倍，包含超过23万张图像和29,000个缺陷实例，解决了现有方法在零售物流中因姿态和外观多样性而表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工业异常检测基准（如MVTec-AD和VisA）在制造场景中已达到饱和状态，但在零售物流场景中，由于物体姿态和外观的高度多样性，现有方法表现不佳，需要新的基准来推动该领域研究。

Method: 构建了一个大规模数据集，包含超过230,000张图像和29,000个缺陷实例，涵盖48,000个不同物体，并对多种最先进的异常检测方法进行了广泛评估。

Result: 现有最优方法在该数据集上的AUROC得分不超过56.96%，远低于在制造场景中99.9%的表现，证实了零售物流异常检测的挑战性。

Conclusion: 该数据集为零售物流异常检测设立了新的基准，揭示了现有方法在姿态和外观变化下的局限性，鼓励未来研究解决这一具有挑战性的问题。

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对医学影像中的token mixer进行了首次全面研究，在MetaFormer架构下系统分析了池化、卷积和注意力机制的token mixer在图像分类和语义分割任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然MetaFormer架构在计算机视觉中重塑了对Transformer成功的理解，但在医学影像领域的应用仍然稀缺，且现有工作很少比较不同的token mixer，可能忽略了更适合的设计选择。

Method: 在MetaFormer架构中系统分析池化、卷积和注意力机制的token mixer，评估覆盖8个不同模态的医学影像数据集，同时研究了从自然图像预训练权重迁移到新token mixer的效果。

Result: 对于分类任务，低复杂度的token mixer（如分组卷积或池化）已足够；预训练权重尽管存在领域差距仍然有用。对于分割任务，卷积token mixer的局部归纳偏置至关重要，分组卷积成为首选，能减少运行时间和参数数量。

Conclusion: 医学影像任务中，分组卷积是最佳的token mixer选择，MetaFormer的通道MLP已提供必要的跨通道交互，无需额外复杂设计。

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

Motivation: 传统形态成分分析(MCA)使用预定义的不相干字典，需要根据信号特性手动选择字典。本文旨在开发数据驱动的MCA字典，通过视频场景内容变化的动态特性来自适应学习字典。

Method: 扩展MCA算法，引入基于动态模态分解特征值聚类的技术，自动学习数据驱动的MCA字典。该方法能够根据视频动态特性自适应调整表示方式。

Result: 在Adobe 240fps数据集上验证了DMCA在视频去噪中的有效性，展示了其在提高信噪比方面的能力，特别是在分离微弱目标和海况背景、以及从风杂波中分离自行车等应用中表现良好。

Conclusion: DMCA通过数据驱动的字典学习方法，成功扩展了传统MCA算法，在视频处理和信号分离任务中表现出优越性能，为自适应视频表示提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Motivation: 随着基于扩散模型的图像生成和编辑技术的兴起，这些强大技术对现有鲁棒水印方案构成了新的威胁，需要研究扩散模型对水印的破坏能力。

Method: 提出扩散驱动的图像再生过程来擦除水印，并引入引导扩散攻击在生成过程中显式针对水印信号，显著降低水印可检测性。

Result: 在多个最先进水印方案（StegaStamp、TrustMark、VINE）上评估，攻击后水印恢复率接近零，同时再生图像保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 当前鲁棒水印技术在面对基于生成模型的攻击时存在根本性漏洞，在生成AI时代需要新的水印策略。

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

Conclusion: 现成模型可从社交媒体图像提取有意义信息，补充传统传感器，实时图像采集是未来应用的关键挑战。

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

*An Thi Nguyen,Radina Stoykova,Eric Arazo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通用实例搜索模型在犯罪调查中能有效检索特定对象，但研究发现这些模型会意外地获得识别特定个体的能力，即使训练数据中不包含人类主体。论文评估了两种技术防护措施，发现结合使用可将人员重识别准确率降至2%以下，但防护措施存在漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决通用实例搜索模型在无意中获得识别个体能力的问题，这种能力引发了对个人数据识别和侧写的担忧，而目前缺乏明确的去标识化标准。

Method: 评估了两种技术防护措施：索引排除和混淆损失，通过实验测试这些方法在降低人员重识别准确率同时保持非人物体检索性能的效果。

Result: 结合使用索引排除和混淆损失可将人员重识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能，但发现防护措施存在漏洞，可能通过部分人物图像被规避。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了AI治理和数据保护交叉领域的紧迫监管问题：如何分类和监管具有涌现识别能力的系统，以及应要求哪些技术标准来防止看似良性应用中出现识别能力。

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

Motivation: 现有的神经网络架构搜索(NAS)方法通常针对特定类型的架构，缺乏一个统一的框架来系统探索和比较不同类型的神经网络架构。

Method: 提出了一个通用的图基NAS搜索空间，并开发了新的搜索算法来遍历该空间，同时引入了标准化的训练和评估工具包。

analyzing existing architectures in a common framework. We also propose a new
search algorithm that allows traversing the proposed search space, and
demonstrate that the space contains interesting architectures, which, when
using identical training setup, outperform state-of-the-art hand-crafted
architectures. Finally, a unified toolkit including a standardized training and
evaluation protocol is introduced to foster reproducibility and enable fair
comparison in NAS research. Overall, this work opens a pathway towards
systematically exploring the full spectrum of neural architectures with a
unified graph-based NAS perspective.

TL;DR: VideoMiner通过迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构，结合T-GRPO强化学习方法精确识别关键帧，在长视频理解任务中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时面临冗余信息干扰和复杂层次结构适应性的挑战，需要更有效的方法来理解小时级长视频。

Method: 提出VideoMiner系统，迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构；引入T-GRPO（基于树的组相对策略优化）强化学习方法，结合时空信息和问题指导来定位关键帧。

Result: 在所有长视频理解任务中取得优越性能，模型能够自发生成推理链，树生长辅助素动态调整扩展深度，获得准确性和效率的提升。

Conclusion: VideoMiner通过层次树结构和T-GRPO方法有效解决了长视频理解中的关键帧识别和冗余信息处理问题，为多模态大语言模型的长视频理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人脸建模方法依赖3D可变形模型，限制了表示能力；基于优化的方法质量高但计算昂贵。需要一种既高效又能产生高质量重建的方法。

Method: 扩展学习顶点下降(LVD)方法，集成逐顶点神经场优化与动态预测3D关键点的全局结构指导，使用相对空间编码迭代优化网格顶点，无需密集3D监督。

Result: 在单视图设置中达到最先进性能，在多视图场景中保持高度竞争力，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: GLVD实现了表达性强且适应性强的几何重建，在保持计算效率的同时提供高质量结果，是3D人脸重建的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉的PPO在机器人腹腔镜手术任务中面临视觉输入高维、奖励稀疏以及从原始视觉数据提取任务相关特征困难等挑战。

Method: 将MedFlamingo医学专用视觉语言模型与PPO集成，每回合处理一次任务观察和指令以生成高级规划令牌，结合医学专业知识与实时视觉反馈。

Result: 在LapGym的五个腹腔镜手术任务环境中，MedFlamingo PPO优于标准视觉PPO和OpenFlamingo PPO基线，所有环境任务成功率超过70%，相比基线提升66.67%到1114.29%。

Conclusion: 结果表明医学专业知识在机器人手术规划和决策中具有重要价值，专门领域知识能显著提升基于视觉的强化学习性能。

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPTCHA被用作评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的基准，研究发现逐步推理对解决高难度空间推理任务至关重要，现有商业模型准确率仅21.9%。作者提出CAPTCHA-X基准和基于推理的VLM框架，将准确率提升至83.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAPTCHA作为区分人类与机器人的工具，已成为评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的现实基准。研究发现当前商业模型在解决这类高难度空间推理任务时表现不佳，需要探索如何通过推理能力提升模型性能。

Method: 引入CAPTCHA-X基准，包含7类CAPTCHA的逐步推理解决方案和标注；提出5个推理导向的评估指标；开发基于代理的视觉语言模型框架，利用模型固有推理能力。

Result: 在5种高难度CAPTCHA类型上实现最先进性能，平均解决准确率达到83.9%，显著超越现有基线方法（商业模型准确率仅21.9%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型的局限性，强调了推理能力在推进视觉空间挑战中的重要性，为未来视觉语言模型的发展指明了方向。

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合注意力图和统计过滤的方法，为Vision Transformers生成更忠实和可解释的解释，通过去除噪声模式并引入类别特定变体来产生判别性解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ViT解释方法主要依赖注意力权重，但这些权重往往产生噪声图，因为它们捕获了每层内的token-to-token交互。虽然已有方法结合了MLP块，但作者认为经过适当过滤的注意力仍然是有价值的可解释信号。

Method: 将注意力图与统计过滤相结合，去除噪声或无信息模式，产生更忠实的解释。进一步扩展该方法，引入类别特定变体以产生判别性解释。

Result: 在多个数据集上的评估表明，该方法相比流行的最先进方法能产生更清晰和更可解释的图。除了基于扰动的忠实度指标外，还结合人类注视数据来评估与人类感知的一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个数据集上始终优于或与最先进方法相当，同时保持高效和人类可理解性，强调了人类可解释性对于XAI的重要性。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT机制在文本任务中提升了推理能力，但在视频理解中的应用效果不佳，经常产生误导性的内部独白，导致幻觉视觉细节和覆盖正确直觉。

Method: 提出Visual Evidence Reward(VER)强化学习框架，明确奖励生成可验证地基于视觉证据的推理轨迹。

Result: 在10个多样化视频理解基准测试中，Video-VER始终达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了视频中心推理的独特挑战，鼓励开发能够稳健地将推理基于视觉证据的AI模型，实现"思考时也看到"的多模态模型。

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Motivation: 尽管有TotalSegmentator等先进分割框架，但左心耳、冠状动脉和肺静脉的准确分割在医学影像中仍具挑战性，需要高质量的分割数据集来推动相关研究。

Method: 使用专门为高分辨率左心耳分割开发的最先进分割框架，在带医学专家手动标注的大型私有数据集上训练网络，然后将模型迁移到ImageCAS数据；冠状动脉标签从原始ImageCAS标注改进，肺静脉分割从TS输出精炼。

Result: 创建了包含1000个心脏CT扫描的解剖学一致分割数据集，提供了左心耳、冠状动脉和肺静脉的高质量分割，并识别了包含常见数据缺陷的扫描列表。

Conclusion: 该开源数据集为左心耳形态分析等研究提供了宝贵资源，填补了高质量心脏结构分割数据的空白，有助于推动医学影像分析的发展。

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量方法只能有效利用一个或两个先验，而同时融入多级先验会增加模型复杂度，导致权重平衡和多块结构优化困难。

Method: 使用块项分解将潜在高分辨率图像分解为光谱子空间和空间映射，构建空间张量编码高阶空间低秩性和平滑性，采用非凸模式混洗张量相关总变分进行共同建模，并基于线性化交替方向乘子法设计优化算法。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了该算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够紧凑地表征高光谱图像的多级先验，在张量框架下有效解决了高光谱图像超分辨率问题。

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床使用的生存分析模型难以解释，传统原型学习方法关注局部相似性和静态匹配，忽视了肿瘤的全局背景和与基因组数据的语义对齐。

Method: 建立统一特征原型空间整合WSI全局局部特征和基因组数据；开发稳健表型表示融合关键斑块与全局背景；采用指数原型更新策略维持跨模态关联；设计分层原型匹配方案捕捉全局中心性、局部典型性和队列趋势。

Result: 在四个公开癌症数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在准确性和互操作性方面优于当前领先的单模态和多模态生存预测技术。

Conclusion: FeatProto为关键医疗应用中的原型学习提供了新视角，通过多模态整合和分层匹配机制实现了更准确和可解释的癌症生存预测。

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/FeatProto.

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced
annotated data. We present SSGNet, a unified framework that combines class
specific generative modeling with iterative semisupervised pseudo labeling to
enhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a
standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data
with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo
labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.
These results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation
bottlenecks and improve robustness in medical image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式医学模型受限于特定模态场景，阻碍了从影像、病理和临床笔记中整合互补证据，限制了其发展成为能够跨整个生物医学数据谱系学习和推理的基础模型。

Method: 基于离散扩散框架，使用多模态大语言模型作为扩散主干，利用其先验知识和跨模态推理能力。关键设计包括：(1)移除因果注意力掩码以实现双向上下文；(2)注入连续时间步嵌入以实现扩散感知。

Conclusion: MeDiM支持连贯且临床基础的多模态输出，展示了跨模态医学生成的有效性，为医学基础模型的发展提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance

Result: 在MeViS数据集上达到51.1的J&F分数（比之前SOTA提升1.6），在零样本Ref-DAVIS17上达到73.3（提升2.7）。

Conclusion: 将视频理解任务建模为连续变形过程具有显著潜力，FlowRVS的单阶段生成方法在RVOS任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of forecasting bimanual 3D hand motion & articulation
from a single image in everyday settings. To address the lack of 3D hand
annotations in diverse settings, we design an annotation pipeline consisting of
a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the
forecasting model, we adopt a diffusion loss to account for the multimodality
in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the
benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and
effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,
over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday
images.

TL;DR: 提出原生视频到4D形状生成框架，从视频端到端合成动态3D表示，无需逐帧优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频条件4D形状生成旨在直接从输入视频恢复随时间变化的3D几何和视角一致的外观

Method: 基于大规模预训练3D模型，引入三个关键组件：时间注意力机制、时间感知点采样和4D潜在锚定、跨帧噪声共享

Result: 准确捕捉非刚性运动、体积变化甚至拓扑转换，在多样化野外视频中提高鲁棒性和感知保真度

Conclusion: 相比基线方法，该方法减少了失败模式，实现了更好的时间一致性和生成质量

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在生成多样高质量图像方面表现出色，但难以整合细粒度的相机元数据（如精确光圈设置），无法实现精确的镜头模糊控制。

Method: 模拟物理成像过程：首先生成全焦图像，估计其单目深度，使用新颖的焦点距离变换器预测合理的对焦距离，然后使用现有的可微分镜头模糊模型形成散焦图像。整个过程的梯度反向传播，无需显式监督即可学习基于内容元素和EXIF数据生成散焦效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够在不改变场景内容的情况下实现优越的细粒度控制，在推理时实现精确的交互式散焦效果控制。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合相机元数据和模拟物理成像过程，实现了现有扩散模型无法达到的精确镜头模糊控制，同时保持场景内容的完整性。

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

TL;DR: DropD-SLAM是一个实时单目SLAM系统，无需深度传感器即可达到RGB-D级别的精度，使用三个预训练视觉模块替代主动深度输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代预训练视觉模型可以作为可靠的实时度量尺度来源，替代主动深度传感器，使SLAM系统更简单、成本更低。

Method: 使用三个预训练模块：单目度量深度估计器、学习关键点检测器和实例分割网络；通过扩张实例掩码抑制动态物体，将静态关键点赋予预测深度值并反投影到3D空间。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D基准测试中，静态序列平均ATE为7.4cm，动态序列为1.8cm，与最先进的RGB-D方法相当或更好，在单GPU上达到22FPS。

Conclusion: 现代预训练视觉模型可以替代主动深度传感器作为可靠的实时度量尺度来源，标志着向更简单、更具成本效益的SLAM系统迈出了一步。

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

TL;DR: EgoNight是首个针对夜间自我中心视觉的综合基准测试，以视觉问答为核心任务，包含3658个QA对和90个视频，揭示了现有模型在低光照条件下的性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我中心视觉基准主要关注白天场景，忽略了现实应用中不可避免的低光照条件，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 收集合成和真实世界的昼夜对齐视频，构建EgoNight-VQA数据集，采用日间增强夜间自动标注引擎，并通过大量人工验证确保标注质量。

Result: 评估最先进的多模态大语言模型发现，从白天到夜间的迁移性能大幅下降，凸显了低光照条件下推理的挑战性。

Conclusion: EgoNight为推进应用驱动的自我中心视觉研究提供了坚实基础，有助于开发跨光照域泛化的模型。

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Human3R是一个统一的端到端框架，用于从单目视频实时重建4D人体-场景，能够一次性恢复全局多人SMPL-X身体、密集3D场景和相机轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多阶段流程、迭代优化和复杂依赖（如人体检测、深度估计、SLAM预处理），Human3R旨在消除这些依赖，实现单次前向传播的实时重建。

Method: 基于CUT3R模型，采用参数高效的视觉提示调优，保留丰富的时空先验，同时直接输出多个SMPL-X人体，无需迭代优化。

Result: 在BEDLAM数据集上仅训练一天，即可实现实时重建（15 FPS），内存占用低（8 GB），在多个任务上达到最先进或竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Human3R作为一个简单而强大的基线模型，可轻松扩展用于下游应用，为4D人体-场景重建提供了高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in
