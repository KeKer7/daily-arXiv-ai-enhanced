Extensive experiments across multiple\nbenchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation\nquality and sampling speed."}

While\napplied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology\noffers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies\nfrom CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,\nfrom meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase\ntraining strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The\narchitecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel\nbranches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new\nAttention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a\ncombined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,\nachieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an\nF1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported\nmodels on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch\narchitecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance\ncomparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby\nproving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical\ndiagnostics."}
